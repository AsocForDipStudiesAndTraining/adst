                <p>AMBASSADOR TALCOTT W. SEELYE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 15, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 15, 1993. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Talcott W. Seelye which is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. To start
                        off, I would like to get something about your background, a bit about your
                        family, where you grew up and went to school, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I was born in 1922 in Beirut, Lebanon where my father was a professor. I
                    was born as a fourth generation of my family to live in the Middle East. It was
                    my mother's family which first started the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's family name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It was Chambers, but the first member of my family who went to the Middle
                    East had the name of Frederick Williams. He went out there around 1840 as a
                    Congregational missionary to Mosul in Turkey. You can imagine what the
                    conditions were like in Mosul, Turkey in the middle of the nineteenth century.
                    In his efforts to get established he lost his first three wives successively to
                    disease, pestilence and the usual hygienic conditions that existed there. The
                    first wife was the mother of my mother's mother, that is the daughter of
                    Frederick Williams. She married a Canadian Congregational minister and induced
                    him to go out to the Middle East. That was my grandmother, and she had come back
                    here to go to college, etc. So he goes out as a missionary, as a second
                    generation of the Williams clan, although his name is Chambers, to be a
                    missionary in the Ottoman Empire. He happened to be in what became Turkey
                    proper.</p>
                <p>My mother was born in Turkey and sent to the States to go to college where she
                    met my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SEELYE: He went to Amherst and she went to Bryn Mawr. She did her Ph.D.
                    dissertation on Islam at Columbia. After he finished Amherst he went to the
                    Divinity School at Columbia to become a minister. For three years he was a
                    minister in New Jersey. Then the beck and call of the Middle East that was there
                    in my mother's mind-set got him to go out to the Middle East to follow suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seems like it was dangerous for a male to marry one of
                        your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That's right. So he goes out there in 1919 as a professor, not as a
                    missionary, to the University of Beirut.</p>
                <p>So those were the three generations that started in the Middle East, and I was
                    born there as a fourth. Then, of course, I served in the Middle East while in
                    the Foreign Service. One of my four children who carried on the tradition, the
                    youngest daughter, Kate, who studied Arabic at Amherst, spent two years abroad
                    at the American University in Cairo, and then went out to live in Jordan for
                    three years where she taught English at a secondary school and worked with Queen
                    Noor. So she became a fifth generation to go out there. The family has had these
                    connections for all that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollections of the Middle East as a
                        young lad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Sure I do. I left at the age of eleven and remember, of course, growing
                    up in Beirut. One of the unfortunate aspects of my youth in Beirut was that I
                    became 1000 percent American and resisted learning Arabic. We had an American
                    community school where in those days and Arabic was not taught. At home, we
                    happened to have Armenian servants because there were so many Armenian orphans
                    and refugees who fled Turkey after the massacres. My grandparents lived with us,
                    above us, and they and we hired Armenian orphans as servants; so I did not have
                    an opportunity to learn Arabic from the servants. The result was that my parents
                    decided at one point, when I was nine or ten, to bring in an Arabic tutor to
                    teach me and one of my sisters.</p>
                <p>I apparently resisted that and the result was that when I left Beirut at the age
                    of eleven, I am ashamed to say, I knew only a half a dozen Arabic expressions.
                    This came home to roost at one point later on when I was in the U.S. Army. After
                    basic training at Camp Walters, Texas, my record card popped up, “Oh, Seelye has
                    spent 10 years in the Middle East.” So they pulled me out and sent me to the
                    intelligence training center at Camp Ritchie, Maryland where I was interviewed
                    by an Arab-American to see how fluent my Arabic was. He noted that my Arabic was
                    virtually non-existent.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Anyway, that was the beginning of my awareness that having lived that long in
                    Beirut, people would assume that I knew Arabic. Later on in the Foreign Service,
                    when I spent all the hours of drudgery and blood, sweat and tears learning
                    Arabic and reaching a modest degree of efficiency, people would say, “Oh, yeah,
                    Talcott knew Arabic as a boy.” That used to bother me because this did not take
                    into account all the effort I had put into learning Arabic as an adult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: We came back in 1933 when my father was on a sabbatical. During this time
                    he taught at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, so I went to the Smith
                    College Day School. That was during the depression. The President of the
                    American University of Beirut, Boyard, asked my father to extend for a year
                    because the university was having financial problems. So the second year my
                    father taught at Bennington College, commuting from Northampton. While he was
                    there he was offered the presidency of St. Lawrence University and we moved to
                    Canton, New York—never going back to Beirut.</p>
                <p>I went to high school in Canton, New York and then to Prep School for two years
                    at Deerfield Academy and on to Amherst. I went to Amherst automatically because
                    of my family connections with Amherst going back generations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pointing towards anything when you were in
                        Amherst?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Absolutely not. I was a history major. When I left Amherst to go into the
                    Service in March, 1943, I had no particular career in mind. I was beginning my
                    senior year at that point and still didn't know what I wanted to do after
                    graduation. After three and a half years in the Service I came back to Amherst
                    to finish out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me an idea where you served?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. After Camp Ritchie, believe it or not, I was sent to Iran. The
                    Middle East must have had a subconscious magnetic attraction. At that point we
                    had a large contingent of American troops in Iran in what was called the Persian
                    Gulf Command. This was one of our principal military supply lines to the Soviet
                    Union. Additionally, there was the Murmansk route by sea. The Murmansk route was
                    very insecure because half of our ships were being sunk. So, we needed a more
                    secure route and in late 1942 started to bring stuff up through the Persian
                    Gulf. The Persian Gulf Command was running trains and trucks from Khorramshahr
                    up to the Soviet sector of Iran. The Soviets had occupied the northern part of
                    Iran just beyond Tehran and as far as the Caspian Sea and the Soviets took over
                    the shipments in their zone.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The reason I went out there was because the morale of the troops of this command
                    was at rock bottom. They didn't feel they were in the war since they weren't
                    being shot at. Most of these guys came from trucking or railroad families and
                    had had limited military training. So I was part of an Information and Education
                    program designed to tell the troops why they were there and to keep them
                    informed of what was going on in the war. This entailed much lecturing.</p>
                <p>Then VE Day came but we stayed on. Then V-J Day came and we still stayed on to
                    protect the various military installations we had there. Since there was no need
                    for an international education program anymore, I was sent down to what had once
                    been a large military installation. It was just a ghost camp of about 50 GIs in
                    a place called Khorramabad, which was halfway between Tehran and the Gulf. You
                    may recall that at that point the Soviets established an Azerbaijani Republic.
                    Azerbaijan straddles the Iranian-Soviet border. There has always been a degree
                    of Azerbaijani nationalism, which the Soviets took advantage of. Iran, of
                    course, wasn't happy about this nor were we. Finally, President Truman added a
                    sweetener to the Soviets: “We will pull our troops out of Iran if you do the
                    same.” The Soviets agreed and suddenly in October (1946), I guess it was, we got
                    orders to prepare to pull out within a week. Tehran headquarters would dispose
                    of the installations and we in the field would dispose of the moveable
                    equipment.</p>
                <p>In Khorramabad a tribal leader whom I knew came to me and said, “Now, I know
                    these are going to be closed bids, but why don't you and I cut a deal. You just
                    tell me what the lowest closed bid is and I will undercut that price and give
                    you a cut.” I in high dudgeon said, “This isn't the way we do business.” I
                    mention this because he turned out to have the lowest bid. He was especially
                    interested in the ping pong tables, the mattress covers and odds and ends like
                    that!</p>
                <p>Anyway we pulled out of Iran but I didn't have enough points to be demobbed out
                    of the Service, since I hadn't served in a combat area. So the ship that took us
                    out dropped some of us off at Italy where about one hundred of us were assigned.
                    I was assigned to a position in the Allied Force Headquarters in Caserta. Six
                    months later the process of demobilization was accelerated and I came back to
                    the States in July, 1946 and then reentered Amherst.</p>
                <p>I really didn't have to stay for two semesters since I had enough credits, but I
                    decided to stay for two semesters anyway. On my way back to Amherst I happened
                    to stop off at Deerfield. There the famous headmaster Frank Boyder—who was there
                    for 60 years—asked me, “What are you going to do after Amherst?” I replied, “I
                    haven't the vaguest idea.” He said, “Why don't you come up here and teach and
                    coach?” I said, “Well, sure.”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>While I was finishing out at Amherst I had begun to think about going into the
                    field of international affairs. Having served abroad and having lived abroad I
                    came to realize that that was the field I wanted. But I felt that I had
                    committed myself to at least one year at Deerfield. In any case this year would
                    afford me time to look into various possibilities. So while I was teaching at
                    Deerfield I came down to Washington a couple of times to look into various
                    options. CIA was just getting going and it had a lot of sex appeal. I had been
                    in Army intelligence at one point and had taught combat intelligence at Camp
                    Ritchie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the CIA was very much aimed at Amherst, Williams,
                        Harvard, Yale, Princeton. It was very much a creature of the OSS, which came
                        from these ranks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That's true. In those days there was no talk about covert operations, it
                    was merely intelligence. So it had some appeal. But while I had served in Iran I
                    happened to have met at the American Embassy a long-legged, good-looking
                    secretary who later became the wife of one of my bosses. One time she said to
                    me, “Why don't you go into the Foreign Service when you graduate from college?”
                    I said, “What's the Foreign Service?” She said, “Well, they give this exam every
                    year and this and that.” So that was the first sewing of the seed of possibly
                    going into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>On one of my trips to Washington I also saw some people at the State Department.
                    I remember somebody got me into a meeting with a deputy under secretary, or
                    somebody who was fairly high ranking, who argued in favor of the Foreign
                    Service. And then, one day I happened to see on a bulletin board a notice of a
                    four-day examination for entry into the Service. I thought that this must be a
                    pretty selective outfit. That whetted my appetite a little bit more. To make a
                    long story short I left Deerfield after one year and having been away from
                    college for an extended period I decided I needed some brushing up. In those
                    days there was a summer school at George Washington which served a cram course
                    for the 4-day exam. Unlike the exam today it was all substantive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wrote a lot, I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. You had a half day in economics, a half day in history. You had to
                    be up to date on substance. So I took that summer course with a number of others
                    who came into the Foreign Service and many who didn't make it.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, in those days you had to wait a long time before coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I passed the written exam in 1948 and the orals in March, 1949.
                    Then there were delays of a couple of years before they brought us in because
                    they were at that point trying to build up an administrative cadre. The Foreign
                    Service was expanding, as you recall, and they were opening posts all over the
                    world. So evidently they felt the need for a lot of administrative specialists.
                    I didn't know this at the time, I learned it later. They gave these slots to
                    FSSs, not FSOs. We paid the price since we had to wait. I finally came in, in
                    March, 1951—there is a long story as to why I came in this late. I should have
                    come in a year before that but there was a security problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us about the security problem just to give
                        us a feeling of the times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Okay. It so happened that in 1949 a Kreis Resident Officer program was
                    set up for Germany. I was interviewed and selected. There were 27 of us who went
                    over there in March, 1950, all waiting for our FSO appointments. We were
                    appointed as FSS-7s which meant a salary of about $2,000 more than what we would
                    get as FSO-6s. This made us happy at the time. We had a fascinating two years as
                    Kreis Resident Officers. It was an incredible experience. We were the eyes and
                    ears of the High Commission in these Kreis countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to document the Foreign Service's role in the
                        Kreis Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Should I continue with the security problem first?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and return to the Kreis program afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I had been there about six months when I got a written interrogatory from
                    the security people saying: (1) We understand your brother-in-law, Peter
                    Franck—my elder sister married an American who had been a German and had come to
                    the United States to become an American citizen—who we understand was a member
                    of the communist party when he was a student at the University of Berlin. (2) We
                    understand that your sister is a member of the Washington Book Shop—which is on
                    the Attorney General's list as a subversive organization. (3) What is your
                    relationship with your brother-in-law? (4) What are your political views?</p>
                <p>I was astounded. I wrote a strong response saying: “I know my brother-in-law well
                    and he is a solid American citizen and a democrat. I know that he had attended
                    the University of Berlin and while there was active as an anti-Nazi. He was
                    arrested by the Gestapo and beaten up. He finally fled Germany by skiing over
                    the mountains into Switzerland. He is an anti-communist.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Well, it so happened that I should have gotten my FSO appointment around March of
                    1950 but the security issue delayed it. It didn't bother me much at the time
                    because I was earning $2,000 more a year. My FSO appointment finally came
                    through in March, 1951, a year late.</p>
                <p>I finished my two years in Germany, we will come back to that later, go back to
                    the States in 1952, and I am then assigned to Amman, Jordan. While I am in Amman
                    promotion lists come out and my name is not there. Since my ratings were quite
                    good I began to think: “Uh oh, this security problem has come up to plague me
                    again.” So, when my two years in Amman were up (in October, 1954) and when I
                    went back to Washington I started buttonholing people. I first met with the
                    inspector who had visited Jordan. I said that I wanted to get to the bottom of
                    this. If the security issue was going to continue to plague me, I wanted to get
                    out of the Service. The first interrogatory that I received happened before the
                    McCarthy era, during the Democratic Administration. Now we are getting into the
                    McCarthy era, so things were even worse.</p>
                <p>Then I went to see Ray Hare, the Director General of the Foreign Service, and
                    raised the issue with him. Then I decided to do something else as well. I had
                    met the security officer in Bonn when I was in Germany and he had seemed
                    sympathetic. By this time he had become Director of Security in the State
                    Department. So I went up to his secretary and said, “I would like to see Mr.
                    Minor.” She said to me, “Are you...?” And I said, “Yes.” What she presumably
                    meant was, “Are you an agent?” I was determined to see him. He agreed to see me
                    and looked puzzled when I came in. I mentioned to him that we had met in Bonn
                    and then he said that he remembered. I described to him my situation and
                    stressed that I wanted to get to the bottom of my case. He said, “Your case is
                    probably at the bottom of a pile somewhere. You are a junior officer and there
                    are many, many cases being studied. It just takes a long time to get to the
                    bottom of the pile.” I asked him if he would do me the favor of examining my
                    case while I was in Washington for two months of home leave. I said that if it
                    wasn't worked out I would quit the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>After one month I got a summons to come down to Washington for an oral
                    interrogatory. So I came down and sat around a table with several persons. There
                    was a guy with a stenotype machine recording the proceedings and three or four
                    other people. They spent about an hour and a half delving into every possible
                    nook and cranny of my family. It was an incredible experience. They started out
                    with my brother-in-law, of course. I pointed out that he was a fervent
                    anti-Nazi. I understood that in his student organization in Berlin there were a
                    lot of communists because most of the militant anti-Nazis were evidently
                    communists. But he was not one of them. His father was totally apolitical. He
                    was a well-known chemistry professor. I pointed out that my brother-in-law had
                    worked with the OPA during the war and no questions had been raised.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Then they went into my sister's connections with the Washington Book Shop. Then I
                    had another sister who had started the Theater Lobby here in Washington. At one
                    point it had had the word “workshop” in its title. “Workshop” had a negative
                    connotation. Then they had found somebody with the same name as my uncle-in-law,
                    Donald Blanschell. This man was secretary of the communist party in Atlanta.
                    Additionally, they had my father on the griddle at St. Lawrence University where
                    as president he had supposedly harbored a communist. I said, “I know who you
                    mean.” There was a Canadian professor there who was very bright and
                    intellectually compatible with my father but who had organized a union against
                    my father because my father sought to clean out the academic deadwood. And he
                    had. So a teachers' union was formed in protest, with this professor as its
                    spark plug. Thus, he caused problems for my father, who left St. Lawrence after
                    five years partly as a result of the union's efforts. So I said, “Rather than my
                    father's having supported him, he is partially responsible for my father's
                    departure.”</p>
                <p>Finally I asked, “What do you have against me?” The reply, “We have nothing
                    against you.” After the interrogatory was over and as I was standing aside with
                    one of those present I commented: “Look, I would like to know whether this is
                    going to work out or not because I will have to make a decision about the
                    Foreign Service.” He said, “I think you can go on to Beirut to the language
                    school (where I had been assigned).” Sure enough, six months later a delayed
                    promotion came through—and from FSO-6 to FSO-5. By that time I had been in the
                    Service five years! I hoped that my security problem was behind me.</p>
                <p>To jump ahead and complete the story on security, from then on promotions came
                    through nicely. I requested my security file about five years ago from the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. I got my file and a third of it was crossed out. I discovered that
                    at one point in my career the security issue had threatened to rear its ugly
                    head again. In 1961 when I was back in Washington on the Arabian Peninsula desk
                    the Department had just developed satellite intelligence. It was a new thing. It
                    was so new that it was super sensitive. Nobody outside a selected few was
                    supposed to know that we had it. Therefore it was on a need-to-know basis for
                    people who held sensitive positions. It was decided that because of the job I
                    had I should have access to this intelligence. I had noticed that every now and
                    then when I would talk to my boss about things I would say, “I don't really
                    think this is happening.” And he would say, “Well, I know it is.” And I would
                    say, “How?” He would say, “Well, I can't tell you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I discovered from my file that when they were re-clearing me for this sensitive
                    access the head of INR requested that I be checked out again in light of my
                    security file. The case was again put before the loyalty board—in those days you
                    had two things, one was the loyalty question and the other was the security
                    question. The board replied, “We have gone through this chapter and verse in the
                    past and this guy is okay. There is no need to review the case.” On that basis I
                    was cleared. So obviously the security issue had popped up again and, who knows,
                    it might have again later! But this didn't show up in the file.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it certainly gives a feel for the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, some day I will have to write a piece for the New Yorker. The case
                    is unbelievable.</p>
                <p>Oh, to add another vignette. When I left Germany after two years I had to be
                    re-cleared. I guess everyone was re-cleared after each post. The security person
                    given the task of checking me out was an Army tech sergeant in
                    counterintelligence, who was assigned to the Kreis in which I had served. He had
                    the job of ascertaining whether I was a loyal and “secure” American. He did so
                    by going to the German officials that I had been dealing with, the Burgermeister
                    and the Landrat and to German friends, to find out if I was a loyal American!
                    And I had been there two years trying to get Germany back into the democratic
                    stream. Here is an American asking Germans if I was a loyal American. An
                    extraordinary thing! The first time I got hints of what was going on was when a
                    German friend wrote me and said, “Somebody has been asking about you and we
                    can't figure out what is going on. He wants to know if you are a good
                    American.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that the Washington Book Shop was a favorite place
                        because people could get 35 percent off. They would get on the list and then
                        “whammo.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Going back now, could you explain the Kreis Resident Program? It was a very
                    unique experience for a whole series of Foreign Service Officers of your age
                    group coming into the Foreign Service. Could you explain a little bit about
                    where you were and what you were doing?</p>
                <p>SEELYE: Sure. First let me say we were all older than the usual entering Foreign
                    Service Officer because we were all World War II veterans. Our average was 29 or
                    30 when we came in. I was 28. And I might add that I think we had a higher
                    quotient of idealism than many others because of our World War experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a selective process. You might touch on this. I
                        think people coming into the Foreign Service certainly had a feeling of
                        mission in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Oh, yes. We were very idealistic. It never occurred to us that we were
                    not going to make much money. That was not an issue. I was only vaguely aware of
                    what an “ambassador” was. We weren't in it because we wanted to make ambassador.
                    We wanted to serve abroad and serve our country.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it is interesting how we were selected to be Kreis Resident Officers. As
                    you know, the U.S. Army trained military officers to be military government
                    officers in anticipation of Germany's defeat and occupation. When Germany gave
                    up these people were assigned the task of running Germany, but they left in
                    1948. The High Commission didn't come in until 1949 and between 1948-49, it was
                    still the U.S. military running Germany. The people who took the places of the
                    trained military government officers were ex-military officers who decided to
                    hang around. A high percentage of them were carpetbaggers, unfortunately. They
                    stayed behind to make money and they did. There were a lot of opportunities to
                    make a fast buck in the post-war situation. You could sell cigarettes for a
                    great profit, gasoline, etc. So those officers—not all of them—were not
                    establishing a very good reputation among the Germans.</p>
                <p>So somebody had the idea...I think Glenn Wolf was one of those...in the State
                    Department or out in HICOG that here were these young Foreign Service Officers
                    waiting around for their FSO appointments who had taken their exams in 1947, and
                    1948. And here were these guys in Germany who were creating a bad name for the
                    U.S. Why don't we take these young Foreign Service Officers and send them out
                    there to take their places? By that time the High Commission had taken over so
                    the State Department could assign people to take the place of these
                    carpetbaggers.</p>
                <p>We were in the first group to go. We were first assigned to the Foreign Service
                    Institute to learn German because most of us didn't know German. We had a crash
                    course and were there for almost three months. Then we went out to Bad Homburg
                    where we were briefed by various people at the HICOG headquarters about our
                    jobs, after which we scattered to the various Kreis, Kreis is a county. We were
                    given the choice of going to Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse or Bavaria. While I was
                    waiting for my appointment I had worked in INR where a former German worked. I
                    asked him for his advice. He suggested that I request Baden-Wurttemberg because
                    it had once had a democratic tradition. So I requested Baden-Wurttemberg and was
                    assigned there with four others. Most of the others went to Bavaria.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>By this time the Germans had resumed control of the government/administrative
                    machinery. The U.S. no longer operated by fiat. But since we were the
                    replacements for the military operators it was difficult for the Germans to
                    adjust quickly to the change. Bear in mind also that by 1950 the Soviet Union
                    was perceived as the primary threat. So our earlier policy of keeping the
                    Germans down and making them pay a price shifted to bringing Germany on to the
                    anti-communist bandwagon. So I got there at just the time that we were focusing
                    on building friendships and creating links with the Germans, which was a nice
                    time to be there, of course. But the Germans didn't always adjust quickly to
                    that. So as soon as I arrived—my first place was Mosbach—I was addressed as
                    “Herr Commandant.” I said, “I'm not a commandant.” So they would say, “Herr
                    Gouverneur.” And I would say, “Hey, look, I am not a gouverneur, I am just Mr.
                    Seelye.” So after that they called me “Herr Mr. Seelye.”</p>
                <p>Well, our mission was varied. In 1952 I wrote a series of two articles for the
                    Foreign Service Journal on what we did. We were there primarily to develop
                    relationships and to get the Germans to understand what U.S. policy was. Also we
                    were to help them democratize, although we weren't naive enough to think that
                    outsiders could come in and democratize them. At least we might do things that
                    would move them in that direction. In a sense we were kind of public affairs
                    officers.</p>
                <p>We had certain specific jobs as well. For example, I remember I had to sign
                    permits for any German who wanted to go to East Germany. We also were somewhat
                    involved in legal affairs, not for the Germans, but for the displaced persons
                    and the refugees. We served as liaison with the U.S. military. In Mosbach we
                    didn't have any U.S. military, but I was in Ulm for a while and there we had a
                    U.S. military installation. My job was to smooth relations between the Germans
                    and the military.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I did was try to establish citizen committees out in the
                    gemeindes or villages. Each German town had a gemeinderat or town council that
                    worked with the mayor. The feeling was that these were the same people who had
                    been running Germany before the Nazis came along and were stuck in their ways.
                    There was a perceived need for a constructive countervailing group. So we tried
                    to establish these citizens committees comprised of people who were not in the
                    gemeinderat, not in the establishment, who would serve as a constructive
                    opposition—forcing the others to open up a little bit. At one time, I remember,
                    one of the Germans most eager to join a citizens committee in one town (after he
                    had had a few beers that I had paid for) proved to be a former member of the SS!
                    No wonder he was outside the establishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I would visit the Burgermeister and Landrat on a regular basis to talk about
                    things. What I would do, since my German was limited when I went out to
                    establish a citizens committee, was to start out in my German and then get my
                    very able German to translate for me. He had been captured in Tunisia by the
                    Americans and had spent three or four years in a POW camp where he had learned
                    English. He was then studying for a graduate degree at the University of
                    Heidelberg. He was a great help. In fact he was so good that he led an English
                    language group that met at our house once a week. He would pick suitable
                    American topics to discuss. For example, I recall that once we discussed
                    Hemingway and another time we discussed Aaron Copeland. The group included some
                    high school students and several scientists because a scientific institute had
                    been transferred to Mosbach from Berlin.</p>
                <p>Occasionally I would go to the local high school and take over the history class
                    and just talk about aspects of the United States. I discovered that still in
                    those days, in the early fifties, the German educational system was still very
                    structured, very rigid. I could never get a discussion going. Nobody would even
                    ask me a question. The high school students who came to our English language
                    group used to tell us that the reason for that was because the teacher always
                    had the final word. Obviously things have changed, but that was the system
                    then.</p>
                <p>My whole staff was German. I had a Woman's Affairs Officer who tried to get the
                    women active in community affairs. Another member of my staff would attend
                    meetings, take notes and prepare reports. Maybe this sounds like spying, but it
                    kept me up to date. In those days there were several German ethnic groups who
                    had fled to Germany from neighboring territories. There was for example, a
                    Silesian group and a Sudeten Deutsche group. Sometimes I was asked to address
                    them. My reporter was an ex-army officer whose English was good. This was a good
                    experience for me and it was a great way to come into the Foreign Service! We
                    had the best house in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. I had gotten married shortly before going to Germany. We lived in a
                    requisitioned house filled with the best furniture that had been collected by
                    the army from the German community. When we invited German friends to our house
                    I would see them sometimes checking out their furniture. Just before we left we
                    discovered in our bomb shelter an expensive painting (all boarded up) obviously
                    stolen by the previous home owner from some place. We turned it over to the
                    local occupations cost office.</p>
                <p>I had been apprehensive originally about going to Germany having been in World
                    War II and having studied modern European history. But the opportunity for a new
                    and challenging experience overrode my reluctance. Once I got there we made some
                    good friends. As self-disciplined people, the Germans I associated with never
                    showed any hostility—though the war was fresh in their minds. They were always
                    friendly and correct.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is pretty much the attitude. I think the Americans
                        and the Germans got along really pretty well in most instances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: They did. And even American troops got along much better with the Germans
                    than they did with the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And even the British, I think. I was a soldier in
                        Darmstadt, in the Air Force, in 1953 or so. Did you ever get any taste of
                        the real world of the Foreign Service? Go to consulates or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. We would go to Stuttgart every month for a meeting of Kreis Resident
                    Officers and there would be a consular representative there. I remember being
                    invited once to a consular reception and acknowledging to the senior consular
                    officer that I really hadn't had a conventional Foreign Service experience,
                    which I noticed he put on my rating as a negative factor. Guess I shouldn't have
                    said that. While serving as a Kreis Resident Officer did not contribute to
                    advancement in the Service, it certainly was an experience worth having had.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: While I was in Germany I requested Arabic language training. At one point
                    during my tour in Germany I thought that I might like to specialize in German
                    affairs. Then I realized that there were plenty of others with more of a German
                    background. That was when I decided to look to the Middle East given my
                    background and the fact that that region was opening up. The response to my
                    request for Arabic language training was that nobody could have such training
                    until they had served a tour in the Middle East. So I was assigned to a post in
                    the Middle East, namely, Amman, Jordan. I was picked for the post by the then
                    newly-appointed Ambassador to Amman Joseph C. Green. He was the man who devised
                    the Foreign Service exams in those days. He had been a professor at Princeton at
                    one point. It so happened that he was head of the orals panel when I came into
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I will digress a bit to tell you the story there. When I appeared before the
                    panel I noticed that the chairman was a formidable-looking person with a great
                    white mustache. Green's first question was, I was a bachelor at the time, “Mr.
                    Seelye, do you drink?” I said, “Yes, I have an occasional beer.” Next question,
                    “Do you date?” I looked stunned, “Of course I date.” “When is the last time you
                    had a date?” I thought, “This is the exam for coming into the Foreign Service?”
                    I said, “Last Saturday night, I guess.” “Hmmm,” was the response. “Are you
                    related to Talcott Williams?” “Yes, he is my great uncle.” “He's your great
                    uncle?” Then Green turned to the rest of the board and told them what a great
                    man Talcott Williams was. It turned out that my great uncle, Talcott Williams,
                    had been his patron at the school of Journalism at Columbia University. Green
                    had studied under him. Williams had an encyclopedic mind, and here is Green
                    telling those who would decide my fate what a great guy he was. And I said to
                    myself, “I guess I've made it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when I took the Foreign Service exam...I had
                        gone to Kent School. Since then I had been at Williams and four years in the
                        Air Force and Kent was way away, but a quarter of the exam was talking about
                        Kent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It was a little bit old boyish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, it was old boyish because another one of my Foreign Service friends
                    who went to Princeton told me that Green called him aside before the oral exam
                    to give him some tips.</p>
                <p>So anyway, I passed the exam. I mention this in connection with Jordan because
                    after he was appointed as ambassador somebody in personnel said to me, “Green is
                    looking for a political officer, so why don't you go see him?” So I went to see
                    him and he remembered me from the orals panel. That is how I went to Amman.</p>
                <p>It was while I was there that I started studying Arabic. I don't know why I did
                    it this way, but there was a nice Palestinian who ran the French language
                    institute. I got him to come to my house twice a week in the evenings. He would
                    give me a phrase in French (he didn't know English) and then recite it in
                    phonetic Arabic. So I started learning Arabic in a half-baked way. While in
                    Amman I requested further training at the FSI Arabic language school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Amman? You were there from
                        1952-55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The situation in what way?</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political structural situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: In September, 1952, the government was run by a Sovereignty Council which
                    consisted of a triumvirate of three elder statesmen. King Abdullah had been
                    assassinated in 1950 by a Palestinian who resented his collaboration with
                    Israel. His son, Prince Talal was a schizo...There is a schizophrenic syndrome
                    in the Hashemite family that pops up every now and then and it popped up with
                    him. So figuring that he was unfit to rule, the authorities packed Talal off to
                    Turkey. But Talal's eldest son, Hussein, was too young to take over. He was 14
                    in 1950. So they created the Sovereignty Council consisting of distinguished men
                    in their seventies to run the show. Protocol in those days was terribly formal.
                    On national days and religious holidays, foreign diplomats would go to the
                    palace garbed either in white tie or in morning coat, believe it or not.
                    Fortunately, my father, who was roughly my same size, had both types of garb
                    which I inherited from him. He used them when he was president at St.
                    Lawrence.</p>
                <p>In 1953, King Hussein assumed the throne at the age of 17.</p>
                <p>Jordan was pretty much a back water then. But on the other hand every now and
                    then it was front and center when incidents involving Israel would occur. At the
                    end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war Israel annexed territory that separated
                    Palestinian villages from their lands. These were towns like Janin and Galquilya
                    where the municipality was on the Jordanian side of the border but all the
                    town's orchards and cultivated fields spread for miles on the Israeli side. The
                    Palestinian farms could not get used to the idea that they could not go ahead
                    and cultivate their crops and pick their fruit when it was ripe. The land had
                    been in their families for centuries. So this marked the beginning of major
                    incidents. The Israelis would deploy a constabulary along the border to shoot at
                    these farmers when they came across. The farmers would then arm themselves in
                    self-defense and you would begin to have exchange of fire. This was when the
                    Israelis began launching retaliatory raids on the Palestinian villages. The Arab
                    Legion, headed by Glubb was reluctant to become involved because all the senior
                    officers were British. Glubb spoke fluent Arabic and had married a Bedouin
                    woman. He was very popular in Jordan.</p>
                <p>These incidents were beginning to escalate and get worse. In 1953, about a year
                    after I got there, Ambassador Green was fired even though his Princeton
                    classmate, Dulles, was Secretary of State. The Charg� in October had gone on
                    leave and I, the political officer and third secretary and still an FSO-6
                    because of my security problem, became Charg�. There was an economic officer and
                    a station chief at the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Station chief being CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SEELYE: And there was also a USIA officer. It was in October that a young Israeli
                    captain by the name of Ariel Sharon, led a cross-border attack against the
                    village of Qibya, wiping out the men, women and children, and demolishing the
                    homes. This was intended as a warning to villagers living along the border to
                    stop going across. Qibya was a cold-blooded massacre. There were other incidents
                    like this while I was in Amman but this was the worst one.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, there was a water problem between Jordan and Israel. The Jordan River
                    ran right between the two. And you had the tributaries and disputes over how to
                    divide up the water. An AID official by the name Miles Bunger proposed building
                    a dam on the Yarmuk River, which is a tributary that runs between Syria and
                    Jordan, for storing water for Jordan. The Israelis were upset at this because it
                    would have deprived them of some water. So this was the beginning of a
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>Secretary Dulles came to the region in 1953 to push for some kind of Arab-Israeli
                    settlement, but got nowhere. Then later, the White House in its wisdom decided
                    that the best way to solve the Arab-Israeli problem was to resolve the water
                    problem between Israel and its neighbors. The theory was that if there was
                    agreement regarding sharing the water, everything would fall into place. Of
                    course that was the height of naivete. Anybody knowledgeable about the
                    Arab-Israeli problem knew that it was a political issue and could not be
                    resolved by economic understanding.</p>
                <p>The White House appointed Eric Johnston, who was the flamboyant head of the
                    Motion Picture Association to get agreement on water sharing. Obviously he knew
                    that his task wasn't going to be easy because in Amman he convened a private
                    meeting with the embassy officers before going to the Jordanians. Our Charg�
                    that time was Andy Lynch. Johnston asked us for our unvarnished opinions as to
                    what chances we thought he had of selling the plan to the Jordanians. Since he
                    asked for our unvarnished opinions, we gave them. We told him that he didn't
                    have any chance of success but that was a political issue. We noted that while
                    the Jordanians would like to have a fair share of the Jordan water, this
                    wouldn't induce them to make peace. There are other more critical issues. But we
                    added that in our contacts with the Jordanians we would support his effort.</p>
                <p>After visiting the concerned countries without success and returning to the U.S.
                    Johnston announced that “the door was still open.” Then he went to the White
                    House...another digression, I don't know if you want me to do this or not...</p>

                <p>SEELYE: ...and said, “The staff in the embassy in Jordan is disloyal. Get rid of
                    them. There are four people I want you to get rid of. [I learned this later.]
                    Lynch (Charg�), Seelye (political officer), Bunger (who conceived of the Yarmuk
                    dam project), and a young CIA clerk who happened to be sitting in on the session
                    we had with Johnston.</p>
                <p>Well, the new ambassador to Jordan, who had just been appointed, didn't know any
                    of us. He said, “Look, I need some continuity.” The first thing they did was to
                    pull Lynch out and assign him as Consul General in Newfoundland (to cool off).
                    Bunger was pulled out immediately and transferred somewhere else. This young CIA
                    clerk, being very junior, was ignored. And then I was left. The new ambassador
                    evidently said, “Look, I don't know Seelye, but I have to have somebody who can
                    provide some continuity.” So he saved me. That would have been my second setback
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new ambassador was Lester Mallory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were dealing with the Jordanians on this and
                        making your approach, what were you getting as a response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, they were saying, “Look, this is not an economic problem. We would
                    be happy to have the water problem solved, but we have bigger issues than that.
                    We have all these Palestinian refugees sitting in our country. We want them to
                    go back. They should not only be repatriated, but recompensed. We are still
                    resentful of the fact that Israel has taken so much territory because the
                    original partition plan in 1947 gave Israel much less territory. So we think the
                    borders ought to be moved back.” Those were some of the key issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Green. How did he get fired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Incidentally, when I finally got to know him as an ambassador, I asked
                    him why he asked such mundane questions at the start of the Foreign Service oral
                    exam. I said, “After all, why did you ask me if I dated?” He said, “Don't you
                    know? We want red-blooded officers. One time I interviewed a candidate and I
                    asked him that question and he thought and thought and finally said, 'I think
                    that the last date I had was about a year ago.'” I said, “What happened?” He
                    replied, “I turned him down immediately.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The main thing that got him fired I think was that every morning between 10:00
                    and 12:00 he would dictate to his secretary a daily letter to members of his
                    family relating the various events of the day before, what he had done, what
                    Jordanian officials have told him, etc. Instead of sending those letters to the
                    Department, he would send them in unclassified fashion to members of his family.
                    We had a code clerk in Amman who doubled as security officer. He decided that
                    this was a terrible violation of security and so reported to Washington, D.C.
                    The security people decided that this was too much.</p>
                <p>Also Green had alienated the Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs, Hank
                    Byroade, by opposing Byroade's earlier request to become an FSO-1. Byroade had a
                    hand in getting Green the Ambassadorship to Jordan to get him out of the way.
                    Once in Jordan Green no longer had the power to keep Byroade from becoming a
                    FSO-1. Then Byroade presumably helped “axe” Green from Amman in his Assistant
                    Secretary role.</p>
                <p>So those were the two things, I think, that got Green canned. This occurred even
                    though John Foster Dulles had visited Amman just three months before and had
                    assured Green, I think, that we would be staying on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of ambassadors, Lester Mallory was a regular
                        Foreign Service Officer wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: He had been an agricultural attach� who lateraled in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, he was kind of folksy in his approach. I think having come out of
                    the agricultural service he probably felt he wanted to do things a little
                    differently. He didn't want to act like the elegant, somewhat arrogant Foreign
                    Service Officer of the past, the caricature of Foreign Service officer pre World
                    War II. So I think he leaned over backwards to show that he was down to earth
                    and a democratic American, so to speak. So that was the way he operated in
                    style. I think he was a good ambassador. I think the Jordanians liked him. He
                    got along well with the King, as far as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First you had this very formal council to deal with. How
                        did you do that as political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SEELYE: First I had Joe Green, who was very formal, to work under and then I had
                    Andy Lynch who was the counselor and then the Charg�, who was also from the old
                    school. Andy Lynch sort of looked like the old type Foreign Service Officer. I
                    got along very well with both Green and Andy Lynch and I think Mallory felt in
                    some respects that I was of the old regime and maybe not totally in sync with
                    his modus operandi. But I did my best by him. He didn't give me the greatest
                    rating, but those things happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the political officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Before I got there there was no political officer. What they did first
                    after the war between Israel and the Arabs in 1948 was to establish a consulate
                    in Amman and Wells Stabler went up there from Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually he was an attach�. It wasn't even a consulate, I
                        don't think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Maybe it wasn't a consulate, but it became a legation. They sent over as
                    minister Gerald Drew, who then took over from Wells. Drew was back in Washington
                    before I went to Amman. I went to see him there. And Drew's deputy was David
                    Fritzlan, who was charg� during the period between Drew's departure and Green's
                    arrival. Fritzlan was political officer in effect as well as counselor of
                    embassy. Joe Green was looking for another body so they gave me the title of
                    political officer. I did political reporting, although I also did other work as
                    well. In fact when the inspector came over he discovered that I had the
                    additional duty of disbursing officer—without any disbursing experience. We had
                    a very, very able disbursing clerk who guided me. In effect, I signed on the
                    basis of his guidance. The inspector decided that I should spend some time in
                    the disbursing office to get the feel for fiscal affairs, which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you do as political officer in Jordan during
                        this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, what I did was, I would visit Jordanian officials and talk to them.
                    I would develop key contacts in certain Arab embassies. I remember the Egyptians
                    had a very able third or second secretary who I kept in touch with because he
                    had his ear to the ground. The British have always had good Middle East
                    specialists and the French Embassy had an excellent one, so I compared notes
                    with them. Of course I couldn't read the Arab newspapers at that point, but we
                    had translations and I followed the papers very closely. I did what a political
                    officer normally does. I tried to figure out what was going on. We did a lot of
                    reporting on the border crossings. I would go down to Glubb Pasha's headquarters
                    and get the latest information on the latest Israel cross-border attack. I would
                    get their analysis and then we would put in our analysis. And there were times
                    that we would make comments on the Arab-Israeli picture and how we saw things
                    moving or not moving. That sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a Jordanian administrative apparatus...a
                        foreign ministry, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: There was a foreign ministry. I did develop a particularly good contact
                    with one man in the foreign ministry. In fact, I remember one time I asked him
                    if he was going to be representing the foreign ministry there at a national day
                    affair. He said, “No, I am representing my family.” He happened to come from a
                    Christian family. We all know that it is the extended family that is the nucleus
                    of politics and social life in the Middle East and that statement from him
                    really struck home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view of King Hussein at that young age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, he was wet behind the ears and I am not sure what his views were at
                    that point. I don't recall that at first we had any real clue as to how he
                    operated or how he really felt. He was just learning the ropes. You could tell
                    that he was a plucky young man. He seemed impressive even then. He had a
                    maturity that seventeen year olds generally don't have. Of course, he had been
                    standing right next to his grandfather when his grandfather was assassinated, so
                    he had gone through quite a bit. I just don't recall any clear feel about how
                    the King operated at that point. I am trying to think. When the Qibyan crisis
                    came I can't recall what he did or what he said. I am sure he must have made
                    some statements, but I just don't remember that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll come back to this from time to time, but what were
                        you getting from your Foreign Service colleagues, their feelings towards
                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I felt very strongly that one should get to Israel as much as possible,
                    so I did. In those days it was not hard to do. I would go to the foreign
                    ministry and say, “I would like to go over to Israel.” They said, “Fine. Just
                    tell us what it is like.” The first time I went I went with my father who was a
                    visiting a former student living in Haifa. You went to the Mandelbaum Gate,
                    which was the separation point between the two countries, and somebody from the
                    Consulate General on the Israeli side would meet your car. You would take off
                    your Jordanian plates and put on Israeli plates. So as soon as you entered
                    Israel nobody knew that you were from Jordan. It was a great way to get a feel
                    for Israel because every soldier hitchhikes.</p>
                <p>Now in Israel, certainly since then and maybe then too, if you had diplomatic
                    plates nobody would accept rides. I experienced that later once. But we didn't
                    have diplomatic plates. So you could pick up a young Israeli and talk to him for
                    20 minutes, half an hour, and get a feel for what things were like and what he
                    thought.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We spent the night with my father's former student in Haifa. We arrived about tea
                    time and his wife was awfully late. She apologized when she arrived and her
                    husband asked her why she was so late. This was 1953. She replied, “Well,
                    because you know I just couldn't bring myself to get on the bus so I walked.” He
                    said, “Why?” “Because of all those dark skinned people.” She was a South African
                    who couldn't bear to sit with Yemen Jews.</p>
                <p>So that was the first time I went to Israel. I went over with my wife another
                    time to visit friends at the consulate in Haifa. Another time my wife and I went
                    to take a little three-day vacation in Askkelon, south of Haifa. We did the same
                    thing. We got permission from the foreign ministry, went over and changed
                    plates, and drove around. So at the time I felt it was necessary for us to visit
                    Israel because of the risk of getting a one-sided perspective.</p>
                <p>How the other officers felt? I didn't sense any anti-Israeli feelings or anything
                    like that. I remember being upset at what the Israelis were doing to the
                    Jordanian villagers. That probably started to color our views about Israel, I am
                    sure. Before that I think our views toward Israel were a little more
                    favorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view of Iraq and Syria at that time, from the
                        Jordanian perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: In those days, of course, Iraq had a monarchy, a cousin of King Hussein.
                    So relations were close. I don't recall many exchanges of visits, but I am sure
                    there were some. But the relations with Syria were not so close, even though
                    Jordan and Syria historically and sociologically and ethnically were one and the
                    same. The whole eastern region that we call the Levant, which is now Lebanon,
                    Israel, Syria, and Jordan, was known geographically as Bilace as-Shan, which
                    means the area evolving around Damascus, around Syria. Syrian families are
                    related to Jordanian families and Palestinian families. So there was a lot of
                    commonality there. But there was the political angle. You had a succession of
                    coup d'etats in Syria. While I was in Jordan the Syrian President was Shishakli,
                    but he was a dictator and the Jordanians were apprehensive about him. Then he
                    was followed by a couple of others while I was there. I felt that relations were
                    correct, but not terribly warm. I think there was the lingering hope expressed
                    by King Abdullah for the creation of a greater Syria. As you know the King of
                    Syria at one point had been Faisal. He was later deposed and the British put him
                    on the throne in Baghdad...Abdullah wanted to take his place in Damascus. The
                    reason he settled for Transjordan was that he saw this as a stepping stone to
                    taking over Damascus as well and creating a greater Syria. So from the Syrian
                    vantage point there was a lot of suspicion about the monarchy in Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Jordan at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SEELYE: As time went on American interests in Jordan became more acute. The U.S.
                    saw Jordan as kind of a linchpin on Israel's border. It was a stable country, a
                    conservative country, a country that the U.S. felt could eventually work with
                    Israel in a peace settlement. This, of course, became much more applicable later
                    as radical socialist regimes came to power in Syria and contrasted with a more
                    stable Jordan government. Therefore, our interests in Jordan became more
                    evident, I guess. But at the time, I don't think we felt we had a great national
                    interest in Jordan. It was a small place. At that point the British were
                    supplying the subsidies and not us. So I didn't sense any great U.S. national
                    interest and I don't think Washington did, at that point. The U.S. national
                    interest has developed over time with tensions in the area and the solid,
                    pro-American role the King played.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an attempt to settle the large number of
                        Palestinians who had left Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Jordan was the only Arab country that automatically gave every
                    Palestinian Jordanian citizenship, as you know. Lebanon gave Lebanese
                    citizenship only to the Christian Palestinians because the Lebanese were afraid
                    of disrupting the balance between Moslems and Christians by having too many
                    Moslems. Most of the Palestinians were Moslem. Other countries were selective.
                    Even Egypt was selective. Jordan gave all Palestinians citizenship. Now this
                    doesn't mean necessarily that they were all immediately treated equal. A lot of
                    them came into the government, because the Palestinians are very bright and able
                    and qualified. In fact, I saw a report recently that indicated that there are
                    more Palestinians per capita with graduate degrees than Israelis. The Israeli's
                    being a small minority discriminated against, have developed the urge to excel.
                    The Palestinians have developed that same kind of bent. If the Palestinians were
                    to tap their own best people, they would do very well in running their own
                    country. Of course, there are quite a few Palestinians in refugee camps (that we
                    serviced by UNRWA). Educated Palestinians have become doctors and lawyers and
                    have been integrated into the societies in which they live. They also serve in
                    governments. At first Palestinians serving in state government were slightly
                    discriminated against. The same thing is true of groups who do not come from the
                    right part of a country, or right tribe. But as time has gone on Palestinians
                    have become integral to such governments as in Jordan. But in my day most of the
                    key people in the Jordan government were Jordanians, and the Palestinians were
                    just beginning to move into key positions. The head of the foreign ministry,
                    however, was a Palestinian. He was from a very distinguished family from
                    Jerusalem. We found the Palestinians quite congenial because they were in
                    general better educated than the Jordanians.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The West Bank was part of Jordan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. When the war broke out between the Arabs and Israel, King Abdullah
                    ordered the Arab Legion to move onto the West Bank, which had been part of
                    Palestine. So they did and they established a line of defense under Glubb Pasha.
                    It was a sensitive position for the British to be in because Glubb Pasha and his
                    key officers were English. But the Arab Legion retreated from two places called
                    Lydda and Ranle because Hagganah, the Jewish militia, wanted to obtain more
                    territory and have more space inland from the sea. The Arab Legion agreed to
                    withdraw. So even after the cease-fire and the war was over, the Arab Legion
                    pulled back several miles, for which the Jordanians have never been forgiven by
                    many Palestinians. But Jordan did hang on to one half of Jerusalem, known as the
                    Arab sector. Abdullah then annexed the West Bank, but there were only two
                    countries that ever formally endorsed that annexation—one was Pakistan. Nobody
                    else formally recognized it. Nevertheless, Jordan, as a country including the
                    West Bank, was recognized diplomatically. So in a sense we did de facto
                    recognize Jordan's acquisition of the West Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Palestinian refugees under pressure from
                        agitators to get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: In those days not very much. Their conditions were not very good. I don't
                    recall Palestinian demonstrations while I was there. My memory may fail me. I do
                    recall, however, a demonstration by a militant, fundamentalist group, which is
                    interesting in light of events of today. It shows that Islamic fundamentalism
                    goes back quite a ways. The demonstration happened when I went out to the
                    airport to meet one of the few congressional delegations that visited Jordan
                    during my tour. We rode in cars with embassy diplomatic plates and happened to
                    pass by a mosque just after Friday prayers. The Imam had apparently been giving
                    a political diatribe and as these people poured out of the mosque they suddenly
                    saw Americans. So they picked up some stones and started throwing them at us. We
                    managed to get away. One congressman sitting in the car said to me, “By the time
                    these stones get back to the States they will be big rocks.” This was an
                    organization that was called the Ikhwan, a hard-line, militant Islamic
                    organization. So I became aware of that way back then, but I don't remember
                    anything else of that nature. In those days the Palestinians were not that
                    political. You could talk to any educated Palestinian and he would gripe about
                    having lost his lands, etc., but I didn't sense then that their was a political
                    Palestinian movement. That movement really developed in an active way with
                    Arafat.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: So the politicization of the Palestinians didn't really occur until after
                    I left Jordan. Arafat was the one in the sixties who really built up the
                    political movement. I don't recall that there was Palestinian militancy in my
                    days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and they finally got you into Arabic
                        training...1955-56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I finally got my Arabic training after hopefully having cleared up my
                    security problem. I went to Beirut and arrived just at the time that they were
                    about to fold up the Arabic Language School. There were money problems. So they
                    hadn't appointed a regular class. Instead they had taken me out of Amman, and a
                    colleague out of Baghdad, Carl Walstrom. They figured that since I had studied
                    some Arabic on my own in Jordan and he had studied some on his own somewhere
                    else, we could go there in place of a whole class. So there was no head of the
                    institute. There was one wonderful person there who was the anthropologist, Kep
                    Lewis, who was acting head. He was just a terrific guy. Kep pretty much let us
                    go about learning Arabic the way we wanted. Both of us were well motivated and
                    he let us work things out with our instructors. In retrospect, I think I made a
                    mistake in focusing so much on the spoken Arabic, which I thought was of
                    overriding importance because it enabled one to deal with people in a community.
                    You could always get somebody to translate something for you that had been
                    written. So I went overboard on spoken Arabic. I could have learned more in
                    terms of writing and reading, although I learned a certain amount. And
                    unfortunately in those days they taught the colloquial Lebanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does colloquial Lebanese fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Arabic colloquial in one country differs from that in another. The closer
                    you get to the Arabian Peninsula, the closer you get to the classical Arabic in
                    the spoken language. After a year in Beirut I was assigned to Kuwait and during
                    my four and a half years there I tried to get rid of my Lebanese dialect and
                    accent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the embassy at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Oh, yes. We actually saw quite a bit of the embassy officers in Beirut on
                    social occasions. I played on the embassy softball team. I think we were
                    formally assigned to the embassy for diplomatic purposes. So we didn't feel out
                    of things. The embassy was very good about including us. While I was very
                    motivated to study Arabic I couldn't really take more than four or five hours a
                    day of intensive Arabic, so I enjoyed the tennis courts of Beirut and took my
                    kids to the beach. This was one of the dividends of language training, although
                    studying a tough language like Arabic was demanding.</p>

                    Zein Nurrdin Zein, lectured on Islamic history. So we used to attend his
                    lectures once or twice a week. You mean lecturing on the Middle East?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, not in Beirut. Everybody there was pretty much a Middle East

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the wives getting any Arabic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: They were not offered any Arabic at U.S. government expense in those
                    days. My wife had two little kids and really had her hands full. They did later
                    on, as you know, but in those days they didn't. Strangely enough earlier in
                    Germany there was money available for her to study German. But not in Beirut.
                    Later on she did have the opportunity to study Arabic in Kuwait and in Saudi
                    Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there were only two language students while you were

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. Near the end of our tour there, a class did come in after a year of
                    Arabic language study in the U.S. I finished there in March, 1956 and that class
                    came in February. So it had two full years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have you there from 1956-60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, that's right.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I was assigned there first as vice consul. There were two officers there,
                    consul and vice consul. Bill Brewer was the consul. The consulate had not been
                    opened that long. I think we opened it in 1951, something like that. So my job
                    was economic reporting, consular work (the only consular job I ever had in the
                    Service), and other odds and ends including administrative tasks. I was vice
                    consul there from March, 1956 until I went on home leave in April, 1957—for one
                    year. Shortly before I left I got a message from Washington saying they were
                    going to appoint me to be consul, to take Bill Brewer's place. So I went on home
                    leave and came back to be consul in June, 1957 and was full consul there until I
                    left in July, 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Kuwait? Was Kuwait an independent country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, it was not independent yet. Kuwait did not get independence until the
                    year after I left. It was a British dependency. As you know, around the Gulf the
                    British had political agents who ran foreign affairs and defense for these
                    sheikhdoms, which were really nothing more than village states made important by
                    their oil. So the British political agent had an important job and a lot of
                    stature. In Kuwait he had been the only foreign representative until 1951, when
                    the Gulf Oil Company (which had originally gotten the concession but was forced
                    to share it with BP, half and half) said to the British, “Look, we need some
                    American representation here. Our people need their passports renewed, some help
                    with guys who get in trouble, etc.” Well, the British, I understand, resisted
                    this for some time until Herbert Hoover, Jr., who was then Deputy Under
                    Secretary of State, weighed in heavily. The British agreed to the establishment
                    of an American consulate. So we had the only other foreign representative there
                    besides the British political agent.</p>
                <p>We had very close relations with the British political agent. I used to see him
                    at least once a week to compare notes. And then there were American and British
                    at the Kuwait Oil Company in Ahmadi, which is 25 miles away. While I was there,
                    unfortunately, a lot of social life revolved around Ahmadi. They often had a lot
                    of oil visitors and we would be invited down. So we spent a lot of time going
                    back and forth.</p>
                <p>But Kuwait was small enough in those days that you really got to know Kuwaiti
                    families. When we arrived there was still a mud wall around Kuwait. The
                    consulate was located outside the mud wall on the water. Our building was an old
                    building with thick walls made of coral rock and covered with mud. The roof was
                    made of palm fronds and mud. Of course, when it rained in the winter you were
                    constantly trying to plug leaks. It was a stately old-style house. We lived in
                    one part of the house and the offices were in the other part of the house. There
                    was just a desert track leading out to it, there was no road. The closest wall
                    gate to the consulate was about a mile away. So we had to go out of our way to
                    go into town. While we regretted the tearing down of the wall, from a practical
                    standpoint it made it a lot easier for us to get to town.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July 14, 1958, the Iraqi revolution. What happened to you
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It had some personal impact on us because we had entertained at our house
                    a few days before a couple of American businessmen who were among those who were
                    pulled out of a Baghdad hotel and put into a truck—where a mob grabbed them and
                    tore them to pieces. The Kuwaitis were not that unhappy with the Iraqi
                    revolution, strangely enough. I remember once just before that sitting in the
                    VIP lounge at the airport waiting the return of the ruler. Whenever the ruler
                    traveled you went out to say goodby and then again to welcome him back. His
                    nephew, Sheik Jabir al-Ahmad, who is now the ruler, was then head of security in
                    Ahmadi and he was sitting next to me. I mentioned the fact that I heard there
                    were some problems in Iraq and trusted that the monarchy wasn't in trouble. He
                    gave me the finger-across-the-neck gesture and implied that it was time for it
                    to go. While it is true that Kuwait was very much a microcosm of Arabism—there
                    were many Palestinians and Egyptians living there—you still had a kind of
                    monarchy in Kuwait. Yet, the Kuwaitis were apparently not too unhappy with what
                    happened to the monarchy in Iraq. Of course the British were unhappy and we were
                    unhappy. A few days later the U.S. Marines landed in Beirut. That made things a
                    little dicey. We were concerned that there would be reverberations in Kuwait
                    against the U.S. There was a lot of pro-Nasserism sentiment in Kuwait and
                    ostensibly, we had moved into Lebanon to arrest the expansion of Nasserism. So
                    the British political agent put some Kuwaiti troops around the consulate, though
                    in retrospect that probably was not necessary.</p>

                        Kuwait at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the October 1956 war, really the Suez crisis. Did
                        that impact on you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes it did and particularly on the British there, of course. It impacted
                    favorably on me because Eisenhower had intervened and told the British they
                    should pull back. I was really the shining light at that point. The poor British
                    political agent was, of course, the fall guy. I will never forget, we were
                    sitting next to each other at some kind of celebration. The Kuwaiti Minister of
                    Education was also there. At one point a mock battle was staged showing
                    guerrillas attacking the British at Suez. At this point the British political
                    agent stood up and walked out. The strongly pro-U.S. sentiment didn't last too
                    long, of course. But it was nice to enjoy the favorable light for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Sabah family there? Their
                        ability to do things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I had great admiration and esteem for the then ruler, Abdullah al-Salem
                    al-Sabah. He assured that the oil revenues were spread around. With all this
                    money suddenly flowing in, it could have been misspent. But the ruler devised a
                    gimmick to enable the money to be spread out. All the land belonged to the Sabah
                    family. He would designate parcels of land that people could obtain for
                    practically nothing. Then, of course, as the place boomed the value of that land
                    escalated, enabling the land to be sold at tremendous profit. That was the basic
                    way that oil revenues were spread around. Also the ruler was very enlightened in
                    the way he created excellent schools. Money was no object in building these
                    schools. Five big Kuwaiti firms with five British partners did all the school
                    construction at 20 percent cost plus. Also hospitals were built with British
                    staffs. They brought in mainly Egyptian teachers to the schools. Every Kuwaiti
                    got a free education and free medical care. No Kuwaiti had money worries.
                    Everything was handed to a Kuwaiti on a silver platter.</p>
                <p>At the time we thought this was great. In retrospect, of course, it spoiled the
                    Kuwaitis and contributed, in my view, to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti war. It wouldn't have
                    happened if the Kuwaitis had handled things right, but that is another
                    story.</p>
                <p>Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah was a man of simple tastes. He, himself, didn't take
                    much money. He was smart enough to set Kuwait on a very positive course. Now to
                    what extent the British had a role in influencing him, I don't know. They may
                    have.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Totally observers. Of course I got to know key Kuwaiti figures. The
                    general manager of the oil company on the spot was an American, the overall
                    manager came out of London. The American general manager was very, very fair,
                    and had a good reputation. His name was L.T. Jordan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Around this time I was in Dhahran and ARAMCO was running
                        things. ARAMCO was for the time extremely enlightened in bringing the Saudis
                        into the business, whereas you go over to the island of Bahrain a few miles
                        where the British there were trying to keep the Bahrainis down. How were
                        things being done in Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: You are right, ARAMCO set a fine example. KOC, the Kuwait Oil Company,
                    came after ARAMCO, so they were somewhat influenced by ARAMCO. However, ARAMCO
                    was in an eastern province where there was no infrastructure and the government
                    in Jeddah was so far away it couldn't care less. So ARAMCO felt there was a need
                    to create hospitals and schools. KOC didn't have to do anything like that
                    because the Kuwaiti government was doing it itself. KOC provided for Kuwaitis
                    working for the oil company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they bringing in Kuwaitis as managers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Not when I was there because there weren't any Kuwaitis qualified at that
                    point. I remember when the first Kuwaiti came back from getting a petroleum
                    engineering degree and was so proud of it that his card indicated that he was
                    the first Kuwaiti to have a degree as a petroleum engineer. But he wanted to sit
                    at his desk and pontificate rather than go out into the oil fields and get his
                    hands dirty. So, while I was there there were no Kuwaitis in upper management.
                    Most were British or American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Kuwaitis look at the Shah and Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Kuwait has an element in its population of Iranian extraction that goes
                    back a hundred years or more. It came down from southern Iran, which is known as
                    Khuzestan, which was more Arab than Persian for many years. So many of these
                    Iranians who have been in Kuwait for a hundred years are of Arab stock.
                    Nevertheless, they are known as Iranians because they came from Iran. I sensed
                    in Kuwait an anti-Iranian sentiment. While many of the Kuwaiti merchants of
                    Iranian origin were successful and wealthy and seemed to be accepted,
                    nevertheless, if you talked privately to a Kuwait from the old stock, he would
                    grumble about these “ajamis.” “Ajami” in Arabic means foreigner, but in Kuwait
                    it meant Iranians. So I sensed then an anti-Iranian sentiment there which I am
                    afraid remains.</p>
                <p>Also, Iranians came in illegally to be used for unskilled labor. They did a lot
                    of the dirty work. The British, who were running the show, were pro-Shah. I
                    didn't sense among the Kuwaiti officials any resentment or antipathy against the
                    Shah. The Kuwaiti anti-Iranian sentiment was directed at the people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Correct</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: For the first year I was an assistant desk officer. The principal desk
                    officer for Jordan-Iraq was Carl Walstrom, and I came in as the number two. I
                    was that for about a year and then Hermann Eilts departed from being desk
                    officer for Arabian Peninsula affairs. I took over from him for three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Arabian Peninsula affairs in those days consisted of
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It consisted of the whole Arabian Peninsula including Yemen, all the Gulf
                    countries and Kuwait. In addition we had a very odd and interesting
                    responsibility because Hermann Eilts was such an incredibly able and talented
                    individual that they had assigned him responsibility for UNRWA as well. That was
                    the United Nations relief organization that was set up to take care of the
                    refugees. That responsibility normally fitted in the Bureau of International
                    Organization Affairs. But both because of its Middle East nature and Hermann's
                    presence there UNRWA affairs was given to the office of Arabian Peninsula
                    Affairs. So I took over that responsibility, which was a very unusual marriage
                    of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back to the first year you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Then I was dealing with Jordan and Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues in the 1960-61 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, in Iraq, of course, it was in the aftermath of the 1958 revolution
                    when the Hashemite monarch was overthrown. Abd al-Karim Qasim had taken over. I
                    think he was still in power throughout my tenure. It was a difficult time for
                    the U.S. because obviously we had had a very close relationship with the Iraqi
                    monarchy. Thereafter, our relations eroded. We still had a presence there, we
                    had an ambassador there, but it was not a happy relationship.</p>
                <p>As far as Jordan is concerned, of course the King was increasingly establishing
                    himself. He came in in 1953 when I was in Jordan. It took him a while to get
                    established. By 1960-61, I think he was pretty confident in his role as king. I
                    don't recall any difficulties or crises in that period which affected our
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we must have been thinking all the time,
                        particularly after the July, 1958 business in Baghdad, of what would happen
                        if King Hussein was assassinated or overthrown. Was this so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, of course, that is over thirty years ago. I didn't sense that the
                    King was at risk in the 1960's. Of course, in the late fifties there was an
                    effort by the military to overthrow King Hussein. I have a feeling that by
                    1960-61, things had settled down. I don't recall our being concerned at that
                    point about the king's tenure. I think it was a fairly calm period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we watching the Palestinians? They seemed to be
                        everywhere throughout Saudi Arabia, where I was, running things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, at that point in time, the PLO had not yet become militant. At that
                    point the Palestinians were tame. Obviously any Palestinian that you talked to
                    had very deep grievances and he articulated them, but there was not an active
                    organized political movement. In those days the PLO existed as an office at the
                    UN in New York. There was a man by the name of Ahmad Shukein who used to give
                    long-winded speeches attacking Israel. But he was a one-man show. There were the
                    refugees in the camps, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, you had well-off
                    Palestinians who were becoming integrated into the Jordanian leadership and
                    society. But Palestinian political consciousness was not reflected in any
                    institutional way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to the Arabian Peninsula where you were from
                        1961-64, what were the main concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the first concern—and that happened soon after I took over—was the
                    crisis in Kuwait, just after Kuwait established independence. I left Kuwait
                    about a year before it established independence. The crisis occurred when Abd
                    al-Karim Qasim pounded the table and said, “Kuwait cannot be independent. Kuwait
                    is an historical part of the Iraqi homeland and I, Abd al-Karim Qasim will not
                    tolerate it.” He began to beat the drums. This created a lot of tensions in the
                    area. Iraq pretended to mobilize its troops and the press thought that the
                    Iraqis were deploying troops along the Kuwaiti border. This was not, however,
                    the case. We knew that from our intelligence. Iraq had not moved its troops that
                    far, but Qasim made it look as if that were the case. So the British moved in
                    some troops to help defend Kuwait. Then, because that was not considered the
                    most desirable thing for the Kuwait government to do—here was an Arab country
                    just independent turning to the British, the “imperialists”—and whereby the Arab
                    Legion peacekeeping force was brought in to provide an Arab cover. This was
                    intended to deter Qasim from rolling across the border.</p>
                <p>And I recall being called into the Assistant Secretary's office, at that time it
                    was Phil Talbot. The front office was very concerned about the possibility of
                    Iraq's moving into Kuwait. I pointed out that in the first place we didn't have
                    any information that Iraq had that many troops mobilized. Furthermore, I
                    described the nature of the road between Basra and Kuwait, which was then still
                    a dirt track. I had just traveled it myself the year before. And I said that
                    that would impede a rapid response and that in any case we would have enough
                    advance warning. And in those days, as you may remember, desk officers were not
                    allowed to be appointed desk officers to any country unless they had served in
                    that country. My knowledge of that road was later cited as an example of why one
                    should serve in a country before becoming a desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it is handy. Today we are talking about intervention
                        in Bosnia. Well, I was a consul in Bosnia, and I am thinking, “Oh, my
                        God.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I think these young desk officers resigning over Bosnia who have
                    been in the Foreign Service only a few years and have never served in the
                    country is regretful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it is interesting that those were the ground rules and
                        it does make a difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: So that was the Kuwait crisis and I remember...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we saying that this was a British job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SEELYE: We were saying it was a British job. We had no intentions of getting
                    involved. It was a big issue at the UN and I remember going into IO, where Joe
                    Sisco was then in charge of the office, and we all sat around and listened to
                    the report from the UN on the deliberations and the condemnations of Iraq. Then
                    the crisis calmed down. I remember the Gulf Oil Company coming in and being
                    quite concerned, because it had a 50 percent interest in the oil of Kuwait. That
                    was the first crisis that I remember coming to our attention at the Arabian
                    Peninsula office.</p>
                <p>I remember that during the Kuwaiti crisis journalists attached to the State
                    Department wanted to know all about Kuwait. So Al Simms, who was then our
                    regional public affairs officer, asked me if I would address them. I said,
                    “Sure, I have some slides.” So I gave a slide lecture which I put together with
                    the help of the media people upstairs. I showed what Kuwait was like and
                    answered various questions. And for that I remember getting a very nice letter
                    that Al Simms wrote to my file about this. In those days, remember, everybody
                    thought it important to have letters of commendation in their files...</p>
                <p>Of course Saudi Arabia was the pivotal country in the Peninsula and the country
                    we focused most of our time on. At that point there was an uneasy period in
                    Saudi Arabia because the successor to the great Abdul Aziz was King Saud the
                    prodigal son. Saud was not very intelligent and administered the treasury
                    haphazardly. I remember how, during some crisis in the Middle East, he offered
                    the Syrians $2 million as a political bribe. It was recognized that his
                    continued tenure would lead to an erosion of the situation in Saudi Arabia. We
                    were worried. In 1961 he fell ill, and he came to the Peter Brent Brigham
                    hospital in Boston for treatment. He suffered from very serious ailments
                    including galloping syphilis.</p>
                <p>Despite Saud's flaws we of course realized that we had to pay some attention to
                    him while in the U.S. I remember sending Andy Killgore up to call on him. I was
                    dealing with the Saudi Ambassador, Abdullah Khaggal, concerning the King's
                    presence here. The King was of the view that being head of state, who happened
                    to be in the United States for medical reasons, the president of the country in
                    which he was being treated medically should call on him first. At that point our
                    President was Jack Kennedy. The plan was that once the King got out of the
                    hospital he would have a period of recuperation in this country. They had first
                    planned on sending him out West some place.</p>
                <p>Wanting to satisfy Saudi protocol, I investigated at the White House whether it
                    would be possible for the President—who was going to Hyannis Port for weekends
                    at the time—to swing by the Peter Brent Brigham Hospital. I was told that this
                    was impossible. The President wouldn't take time out to do this. So the next
                    question was how could we create a situation whereby with a minimum of effort
                    the President could call on the King. This would salve the King's pride and
                    enable the King to accept a Presidential invitation to have a meal with him at
                    the White House. It was agreed that Saudi Arabia was important enough to us that
                    the President should meet with him at the White House. But the King would not go
                    to the White House until the President called upon him. That was the
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>As the weeks went by I noted that Kennedy was now going to Palm Beach and maybe
                    we could persuade the Saudis to induce the King to recuperate in Palm Beach
                    rather than out West. They thought that was a good idea and they were able to
                    find a house belonging to Merriweather Post, which they rented for a month. The
                    King went down to Palm Beach. Then I talked to Angier Biddle Duke, who was head
                    of protocol and a close friend of Kennedy's. I noted that it was only fifteen
                    minutes from the President's house to the Post house. A fifteen minute visit by
                    Kennedy was all that was necessary and then a dinner at the White House could be
                    set up. As it turned out the White House reluctantly agreed.</p>
                <p>When the King got down there it was agreed that Kennedy would call on him, let's
                    say on a Monday morning. I took a White House back-up plane to Palm Beach to be
                    present during this meeting. A day or so before that meeting I had dinner with
                    the King. The meeting the next day was set up. Angier Biddle Duke went to pick
                    up Kennedy and as he told me later, Kennedy kept saying, “What am I doing
                    calling on this guy?” Duke, who was a pretty good man said, “Well, I understand
                    that this is very important to the Saudis from a protocol standpoint, it is part
                    of their cultural requirements and we have to be sensitive to that.” So they
                    arrived and Kennedy came into the living room and the King, who was a big man,
                    about 6'4”, wore dark glasses that were very narrow. He was very somber looking.
                    Normally when the President is meeting with a foreign dignitary there is a State
                    Department interpreter. In those days it was Camille Nowfal. But since this was
                    just a courtesy call, with no substance to be discussed, there seemed no point
                    in sending a special interpreter down from the State Department. So an aide to
                    the King, who was a very distinguished Palestinian with Saudi nationality, was
                    to do the interpreting. His name was Jamal Husseini from the famous Husseini
                    family from Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>The exchange of conversation starts. The President says, “Your Majesty I am
                    looking forward to seeing you in Washington next week. It will be a great
                    pleasure for me.” And the King responds, “Inshallah.” The interpreter translated
                    the Arabic word literally and said, “God willing.” You should have seen the
                    President's startled face. You could see what was going through his mine. “I am
                    going out of my way to meet this s.o.b., and I am saying how nice it is to meet
                    him and all he says is 'God willing'”. So that didn't start the meeting off too
                    well. It was a lesson that most professional interpreters understand. They try
                    to translate the cultural context of what a person says. What the interpreter
                    should have said was, “I am looking forward with great pleasure to meeting you
                    at the White House Mr. President, God willing,” which is supposedly what the
                    King meant. Anyway, they had about a fifteen minute exchange and that was
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Okay, the King comes to Washington later. He was to meet the President at the
                    White House for a luncheon. The White House didn't want to bother having a
                    dinner for him. The Saudi Ambassador, however, was very stubborn and said to me
                    that it could not be a lunch because this was Ramadan, which was the month of
                    fasting. And as you know, you cannot eat during the month of fasting. I said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, there are two exceptions to the fasting requirement: one is if
                    you are ill, and the King is ill. Two, if you are in travel status, and the King
                    is in travel status. So both of these exceptions would enable the King, it seems
                    to me, to accept a luncheon invitation.” “No,” said the Saudi Ambassador, “not
                    at all.” So I had to go back to the White House and tell them that a lunch was
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say go to the White House whom were you talking
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I'm trying to remember. I am sure it was some low level official.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have gotten the rolling eyes and “you
                        again.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. I have forgotten who it was. Well, they finally agreed to have a
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>First there was a morning meeting between the King and the President and each
                    side agreed who would attend that meeting. The Saudis said that their side would
                    consist of the King, the ambassador and I think one other. On our side there
                    would be the President, an interpreter, me and somebody from the White House
                    staff. As we went into the room there was a journalist attached to the Saudi
                    party who walked in with the Saudi delegation. I thought to myself, “Well, it is
                    up to the Saudis to indicate who they want in the meeting. It is not for me to
                    tell the journalist not to come, although he is not on the list.” Well, it
                    turned out that during the meeting the King was quite disturbed by the presence
                    of this Saudi journalist. The King was sitting let's say where you are and then
                    opposite was Jack Kennedy in his rocking chair. I was sitting next to and
                    slightly behind Kennedy with my note pad. Behind me was this journalist. During
                    the conversation the King kept looking in my direction. Actually he was looking
                    in the direction of the journalist. After about two or three minutes, the
                    President turned to me and said quietly, “I think your note-taking is disturbing
                    the King, you ought to put your pad away.” I said, “Okay.” So I had to put my
                    pad away for the rest of the hour because the President thought that the King
                    was disturbed by my note-taking, but he was obviously disturbed by the
                    journalist. I don't recall anything of extraordinary substance that was revealed
                    at that meeting. I think it was a fairly tame exchange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the King a pivotal figure as far as making decisions
                        or was he being bypassed by the apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I don't think he was a pivotal figure at all. Faisal, his brother, the
                    Crown Prince and the Foreign Minister, was the pivotal decision maker. But the
                    King would often go off half-cocked over Faisal's head and that was the problem.
                    As far as our interests in Saudi Arabia were concerned, we were hoping for a
                    change. The doctors at Peter Brent Brigham Hospital had told us that the King
                    didn't have more than six months to live. Actually he lived another couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>So a dinner was planned. I pointed out to the White House that, of course, the
                    Saudis do not consume liquor because it is against their religion. I assumed,
                    therefore, that no liquor would be served. A couple of people who were invited
                    to the dinner party were American businessmen who were concerned with the Middle
                    East (one was Terry Duce who used to be a big figure with ARAMCO) and the other
                    was Kermit Roosevelt. They both called me to see if liquor was going to be
                    served and I said, “No.” So they tanked up.</p>
                <p>We arrive at the White House and here are these trays with big tumblers full of
                    pure Scotch on the rocks. Later on I was told by the White House that since
                    Saudis insisted on a dinner, it would entertain its way. Okay. Terry Duce and
                    Kermit Roosevelt ended up in their cups. On leaving the White House I had to
                    help both of them out. That obviously is not the main point of the story.</p>
                <p>Liquor was being served and the Saudi Ambassador was absolutely irate. He took me
                    aside and said, “How can you do this to us?” I said, “Mr. Ambassador, when we
                    are in your country we always try to be very sensitive to your culture, your
                    habits and your rituals. We may not agree with them, but we honor them. And I
                    hope you will be generous and sensitive enough to honor our customs.” But he was
                    still upset.</p>
                <p>The table arrangement at the dinner was sort of a horseshoe design with tables at
                    right angles. I was down at one end and sitting next to me was Angier Biddle
                    Duke, head of protocol. There were a few Foreign Service officers who knew
                    Arabic sitting behind the guests to help interpret if necessary. At one point
                    the President was not speaking with the King. The King was talking to the person
                    on his right, who was Dean Rusk. Lyndon Johnson, the Vice President, was sitting
                    somewhere else. Between courses, Duke would nudge me and say, “The President
                    can't talk to Prince so-and-so on his left. Why don't you go up and help him a
                    bit.” So I got up and stood behind and between the President and a very dour
                    prince. I introduced myself to the President and said, “Can I help interpret for
                    you with this gentleman?” The President looked at me and said, “Who are you?” I
                    said, “Well, I happen to be the desk officer for Arabian Peninsula Affairs.”
                    “Oh,” he said, “tell me about the background of the King and Saudi Arabia.” I
                    told him a little bit about how his father had united all these tribes and the
                    country. He said, “That is very interesting. Tomorrow call my secretary, Evelyn
                    Lincoln, and give her the name of a good book I can read on Saudi Arabia on this
                    period.” I said, “I have a couple in mind and I will call her.” At that point
                    the next course came so I sat down.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>There was another break and this time Dean Rusk was left alone, so I went up to
                    him and said, “Can I help you with your partner?” He looked interested and so I
                    helped interpret. Then I sat down. Between the final courses I noticed Lyndon
                    Johnson over in a corner. He had a Saudi next to him and there was no
                    conversation going on because the Saudi didn't speak any English. I went to the
                    Vice President and asked, “Mr. Vice President, may I help you interpret with
                    this gentleman here? The Vice President gave me a look as if to say, “Who the
                    hell do you think you are? and turned away. He obviously didn't want any help;
                    he didn't want to speak to the guy anyway.</p>
                <p>During the dinner milk was served to the Saudi entourage and during his remarks
                    the President made a crack to the effect that never had so much milk been
                    consumed at a state affair. Again, after the dinner was over, the Saudi
                    Ambassador buttonholed me once more and I said, “Look, you have to consider that
                    this is what the White House wanted to do and they did it. As far as I can see,
                    Mr. Ambassador, everything went off very well. The Saudi officials seemed to be
                    very pleased.” Then I discovered, shortly thereafter, from a very reliable
                    source, that the King, himself, was polishing off a bottle of brandy a day. It
                    had all started a year or two before when he was seriously ill and his private
                    aide, a man named Id bin Salem, had prescribed a shot of what the King thought
                    was medicine. He took it and liked it and it made him feel better. So he took
                    more and more. As a result he used to keep a bottle of brandy under his mattress
                    in the hospital while he was in Boston. So I thought that was a supreme irony:
                    the Saudi Ambassador's insisting that no liquor could be served and the King is
                    sitting there at the dinner wishing that he could have some of that whisky or
                    brandy, I am sure. So that is just an amusing anecdote.</p>
                <p>About a year or so later the King was deposed, pushed aside, and in anticipation
                    of the Crown Prince Faisal taking over, he was invited to the States. This time
                    the President gave a lunch. We asked Isa Sabbagh, then assigned to our Embassy
                    in Jeddah as PAO, to return to the U.S. to be the interpreter. Isa is a unique
                    individual with a tremendous fluency in Arabic and English and with a great
                    knowledge of Saudi Arabia. He was one of our really supreme interpreters who
                    could really bring two individuals together by understanding the context of a
                    conversation as well as respective cultures. So I told the White House that we
                    were bringing Isa back to interpret. And the White House said, “Fine.” I was a
                    little worried because Isa is not just an interpreter, and he was particularly
                    sensitive to the fact that he was more than an interpreter. I reminded the White
                    House that we were bringing back a senior Embassy official, the Public Affairs
                    Officer, whom the Saudis liked and greatly respected. The White House said,
                    “Well, that is nice, but, of course, he will have to sit behind the President
                    and the Crown Prince.” I said, “Well, you know, I don't think we can do this
                    because Isa is a man of stature and I think we should really make an effort to
                    put him at the table.” “No, we can't possibly put him at the table.” And our own
                    protocol said the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So I thought to myself, “Well, I will go through the motions.” When Isa arrived I
                    called him into my office and said, “Isa, I am afraid the White House has a hard
                    and fast rule. Those who interpret for the President have to, without exception,
                    sit not at the table.” At which point Isa, who has a distinguished-looking
                    goatee, drew himself up and said, “In that case, I won't do it.” There was a
                    pause and I said, “You're right. I thought you would say that and I am going to
                    go back to the White House again.”</p>
                <p>So I went back to the White House and said, “You know, this guy is important. If
                    you want him to interpret, you will have to put him at the table. Otherwise he
                    won't do it and we won't force him to. I understand why he won't because it
                    would demean him in the eyes of the Saudis, who esteem him greatly. It wouldn't
                    look right to his relations with Saudi officials, and I personally feel strongly
                    that he should be at the table.” So after much grumbling they put him at the
                    table.</p>
                <p>So Isa sat at the table not far from the Crown Prince and the President. He
                    didn't get much to eat, but he was close enough so that he could interpret. His
                    face was saved with the Saudis. Isa will tell the story in a book he is
                    writing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say the people at the White House must have
                        detested the thought of the Saudis doing anything with you because you
                        were...</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: We had a good relationship with Faisal already. He had as his special
                    assistant a man by the name of Omar Saqqaf, who later became his foreign
                    minister. The embassy dealt a lot with him. Faisal had a strong attachment to
                    the United States. We were quite pleased, of course, when the family got
                    together and deposed the King because of his illness and his poor leadership.
                    When Faisal came in he not only improved the U.S.-Saudi relationship, but he
                    also took Saudi Arabia out of its doldrums. Saudi Arabia had been in the red
                    financially despite the oil revenues. The new King began to bring things
                    together. So the whole relationship became more upbeat and more satisfactory
                    after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An extremely important problem was the relationship of
                        Saudi Arabia with Nasser who was still in his acme pretty much at that

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SEELYE: The next crisis we had was the Yemeni crisis. In 1962 a revolution
                    occurred overthrowing the Hamid al-Din regime. Imam Ahmad had died a few months
                    before that and his son, Prince Badr, had taken over. The so-called
                    revolutionaries decided that this change afforded an opportunity to overthrow
                    this very oppressive regime, a regime that felt education would not be desirable
                    for its people because that would force the regime to make some major changes
                    that would threaten the regime.</p>
                <p>I remember visiting Yemen in 1961 and at that point the capital was Ta'iz, not
                    Sanaa, the traditional capital. The capital was at Ta'iz because there had been
                    a split in the ruling family and one branch of the family had fled to Ta'iz and
                    had moved the government there. At the top of a hill overlooking Ta'iz was a big
                    building. I was told that there was where the Imam kept the sons of all the
                    tribal leaders as hostages so that they wouldn't rise up against him. So that
                    was the kind of regime that you had there. You walked around Ta'iz and you saw
                    what looked like a prison and the doors were all open because each one of the
                    prisoners had a tremendous iron ball chained to his ankle and couldn't possibly
                    go anywhere.</p>
                <p>The reformers decided it was time for a change and aided and abetted by Nasser's
                    people overthrew Badr in September, 1962. A man by the name of Abdullah Salal
                    took over.</p>
                <p>The first problem was what should the United States do. This was not an orderly
                    change of power. Should we recognize the new regime or should we not? We did a
                    lot of stewing around on that one. The British were very much against
                    recognition because they had their interests in Aden, just to the south of
                    Yemen, and they were afraid the radicals in North Yemen would hurt the Aden
                    protectorate. They urged us not to recognize. But other Arab governments began
                    to recognize Yemen and we decided that we could too because the usual
                    definitions for recognition seemed to apply. One is that the government must be
                    in control of the country, and we felt that this was true. I forget the other
                    requirements but we felt that by stretching this a little bit the new Yemeni
                    regime was eligible for recognition. So we made a public statement saying that
                    we now recognized the Yemen Arab Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little feel for this, was this debate
                        carried out within the State Department with EUR representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I think we cleared cables with EUR, but I don't remember EUR really being
                    very interested in this. I don't think EUR felt necessarily that it needed to
                    defend British interests in this, as I recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Then, of course, the Egyptians decided to insure Salal's survival and introduced
                    some troops. Well, this set the Saudis off. We found ourselves in the middle as
                    the Saudis began to arm the tribes who opposed the new central government.
                    Nasser was quite upset at the Saudis and so he sent in more and more troops. In
                    those days we were trying to develop a relationship with Nasser. President
                    Kennedy evidently was fascinated with Nasser and felt that he was a reformist
                    and that he provided a new look in the Arab world. Accordingly, the U.S. should
                    try to develop a relationship. So we had an AID program in Egypt which helped
                    our links with Nasser even though he was trying to unseat, undermine regimes
                    that were friendly with us like Saudi Arabia, etc. We wanted to maintain that
                    link. At the same time we didn't want the Yemen war to cause internal turmoil in
                    Saudi Arabia. We knew that Saudi Arabia's military was very weak and practically
                    non-existent. Discontent in Saudi Arabia started while Saud was still in power
                    and we wondered how this would erode the Saud regime. There were reverberations
                    within the Saudi political establishment. First one Saudi prince, Prince Talal
                    defected to Cairo. This was quite extraordinary, a member of the Saud family
                    defecting. Secondly, two Saudi pilots defected with their fighter aircraft to
                    Cairo. Third, the police in the western province discovered a parachute drop of
                    weapons. No one picked them up but these events were indications that something
                    was brewing. So everybody was worried, particularly Uncle Sam.</p>
                <p>So we decided that we had to devise some way to keep the two sides apart. I think
                    this tended to accelerate the royal family's decision to bring in Faisal. I
                    can't remember the timing on this. Ellsworth Bunker was selected by the White
                    House to go over and see if he couldn't work out a deal whereby each side would
                    decide to lay off and maybe we could neutralize the situation. NEA was asked to
                    assign someone to the Bunker mission. Bob Strong, who was our Director, came to
                    me early one afternoon and said, “Tonight we would like you to come to dinner at
                    Jim Grant's house. I am going and we would like you to come.” Jim was one of the
                    deputy assistant secretaries. We get into Strong's car along with Grant and who
                    should appear but Ellsworth Bunker. I didn't know him but had heard about him.
                    We all drove out to Jim Grant's house out in Virginia some place. We were served
                    dinner by Jim's wife and I remember thinking that this was somewhat strange.
                    Here are four men and the wife serves dinner without eating with us. Bunker was
                    delightful and had wonderful stories to tell, but didn't discuss anything
                    special. Later Bob said to me, “You have been selected to accompany Ellsworth
                    Bunker on this mission.” What I deduced was that they had apparently proposed me
                    to Bunker; Bunker didn't know me, so this was their way of exposing me to
                    Bunker. A funny way of doing it, not telling me what was up.</p>
                <p>So we headed out not to Yemen, but first to Saudi Arabia to meet with Faisal to
                    try to persuade him to cease and desist in sending arms and money aids to the
                    Yemeni tribes. Then we went to Cairo. I attended the meeting with Faisal, but
                    did not attend the meeting in Cairo with Nasser. I found it very difficult to be
                    of help when I was not attending meetings, but the Ambassador attended them and
                    would take notes. We tried to get Nasser to ease off and we indicated to him
                    that we were trying to get the Saudis to do the same, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>To make a long story short, it so happened that we had to go back three times
                    because the first two times were inconclusive. I remember the first time my
                    suitcase had been lost in Frankfurt and it was finally returned the day I was
                    supposed to go back. I took it home and dumped out the dirty clothes, my wife
                    put in clean clothes and off I went with Bunker again. Not each time to Cairo,
                    but three times to Saudi Arabia. After the second trip Bob Strong called me in
                    and said that I was needed in the Department and they would send somebody else
                    in my place. I said that would be fine with me. So they told Ambassador Bunker
                    they were pulling Seelye off the mission and would find somebody else to
                    accompany him. I was told later Bunker said, “I am not going without Seelye.”
                    Well, that's the beginning of the cooling of my relationship with Bob Strong. He
                    and I had had a good relationship up to that point. I sensed that Bob Strong
                    thought somehow I had so ingratiated myself with Ellsworth Bunker that I was
                    being disloyal, or something to him. I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an issue between Strong and Bunker, or purely
                        bureaucratic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I think purely bureaucratic. Maybe they didn't think I had done a good
                    job, they didn't tell me that. Maybe they decided to let somebody else get some
                    experience. I don't know what the reason was.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Rodger Davies called me in and said I was going after all. So, Bob Strong
                    was piqued after that particularly since he had decided that I wouldn't go and
                    then he was forced to face the fact that I would be going. Bob Strong is a very
                    enigmatic person anyway.</p>
                <p>Well, finally Bunker was able to work out an agreement. I don't remember the
                    exact details now but the Egyptians were to withdraw some of their forces while
                    the Saudis would decrease their aid. And then a UN force was to be brought in to
                    be a peacekeeping force. I remember we saw U Thant up in the UN and talked to
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Secretary General of the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: We knew it was going to be kind of a dicey affair because some of the
                    wording in the agreement was very ambiguous. So that was the Bunker mission. It
                    took quite a while, however, for the UN to assemble itself. If they had moved
                    quickly, Bunker and I felt that we might have been able to hold the thing
                    together. But the UN took several months to get out there and by that time the
                    tribes got itchy and Nasser changed his mind. So the thing kind of unwound. A
                    study has been done on this by the Institute of Diplomacy at Georgetown. While I
                    was out in Damascus I gave them my views.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the mission itself, how did Ellsworth
                        Bunker...he was used on the Guinea negotiations, the Panama Canal and then
                        eventually ended up for a long time in Vietnam and was considered probably
                        the premier American negotiator. From your point of view, how did he operate
                        in this context?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, his main strength was style. He had a terrific style about him.
                    And, two, he exuded integrity. There was an aristocratic and dignified demeanor.
                    He had a wonderful way of dealing with people and with leading them to believe
                    rightly that he was a man of integrity and that when he said something he meant
                    it. But what surprised me was that as we flew over on the aircraft he wouldn't
                    be preparing for his meetings. If I had been the negotiator I would have been
                    studying and working over what I was going to say and taking notes and working
                    hard. I thought it wasn't for me to propose to him what he should do, so we
                    would sit there in the aircraft and talk. He would tell me delightful stories
                    about this and that. Then I would put together some talking points and after we
                    met with the ambassador, we would get together on what he might say. Then he
                    would go in. What surprised me was the minimum time he spent in preparation.
                    Maybe that wasn't important because there wasn't that much to say, I guess. His
                    task essentially was to persuade two adversaries through the force of his
                    personality to agree. So I would say his great strength was style. Obviously he
                    had more than that because he was so successful in all of his negotiating
                    efforts. Maybe the difference here was that he didn't have to go into that much
                    detail. I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with him in any of the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, I was in most of the meetings. All but one meeting with Faisal and
                    we went back three times. I can't remember why I was excluded from that one
                    meeting. We had two meetings with Nasser, from which I was excluded. I don't
                    know why. Perhaps because I was the Arabian Peninsula desk officer and not in
                    charge of Egyptian affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Faisal respond to Bunker and to the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Faisal was not very responsive at first. He felt that Nasser had caused
                    Saudi Arabia terrible problems. So he was in no mood to compromise. It took a
                    lot of going back and persuasion. Omar Saqqaf helped a lot. We persuaded Omar in
                    separate meetings the importance of an agreement. I think Omar was more
                    influential in getting Faisal to finally agree than anybody else. He was a
                    crucial element in the situation.</p>
                <p>But the King was always courteous and pleasant. He never would say out right
                    “no,” of course. I think he was skeptical at first, and rightly so, about the
                    whole agreement. And there was no reconciliation between him and Nasser at that
                    point, that came several years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>One thing that we did at that point was to provide reassurances to the Saudis. We
                    felt that in trying to press them to reduce their aid to the tribes we also
                    ought to—at a time that Nasser was so popular in the Arab world and out to
                    overthrow these conservative regimes—tell the King of our commitment to the
                    Kingdom. So we undertook something called “Hard Surface” which was the name for
                    a mission of the flying U.S. aircraft on patrols south to within x number of
                    miles of the Yemeni-Saudi border. We announced that mission by saying, “This is
                    an earnest U.S. support for the Kingdom.” These Hard Surface aircraft were both
                    a symbolic gesture to reassure the Saudis of our support and as a signal to
                    Nasser not to go too far. We were trying to get both parties to disengage and
                    this was a carrot to Faisal. I think we kept this up for several months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nasser was a burr under everybody's saddle in those days.
                        How were we feeling at that particular time...reaction with dealing with
                        Nasser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, we had this ongoing relationship with Nasser which I mentioned
                    earlier. Nasser was always very pleasant in meetings with U.S. officials. He had
                    a turn of personality that made him very easy to talk to I am told. He exuded
                    charm. I don't recall that he was anymore responsive to our mediation in the
                    beginning than Faisal. I think some people at the time, including the Saudis,
                    felt that our effort did more for Nasser than it did for Faisal because people
                    felt we were helping Nasser out of a bind. So Nasser, if anything, was probably
                    eventually a little more responsive to what we were proposing because we were
                    getting the Saudis off his back in Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the usual thing. You put troops into one of these
                        tribal things and you never win as we continue to learn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That's right. I think the Saudis never were too happy with our mediation.
                    They went along because we pressed them to and they knew they needed us. But
                    they felt in the backs of their minds that we were really helping Nasser out of
                    a bind. And I know that a lot of private Americans, oil people and all, were
                    quite upset at our policy because they thought we were really being pro-Nasser.
                    In fact, we were also helping the Saudis out of a bind insofar as their Yemeni
                    involvement was unpopular at home. Bob Comer was the guy at the White House who
                    was one of the prime movers of this policy of trying to separate the two
                    parties. And at one point I was told, I don't know if this was true, President
                    Kennedy took a great personal interest in this. Comer told someone once that
                    Kennedy had spent 100 hours on this operation. I find this hard to believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this whole thing end up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SEELYE: It ended up temporarily failing partly, I thought, because the UN got
                    there too late to implement it. It was in any case hard to operate in that
                    environment. I think the Saudis may have eased off their assistance, but then
                    started it back up. Nasser decided that he couldn't pull out many troops, maybe
                    he didn't pull out any troops. Differences were not resolved until later. In
                    1965 while I was in Saudi Arabia as Charg� in June, Nasser sent a message to
                    Faisal—they were at odds at that point—saying, “Look, let's see if we can't
                    patch things up. I am on my yacht up in the Red Sea. I am prepared to sail down
                    to Jeddah and let's meet.” And Faisal, being a man of courtesy, said, “Well, I
                    don't think we have anything to discuss, but I will receive you.” I remember the
                    Saudis in the foreign ministry telling me that they were just receiving Nasser
                    out of courtesy, but the differences were so acute that there was no possibility
                    of a reconciliation.</p>
                <p>So Nasser arrived and got off the boat. As Charg� I was at the lower end of the
                    ambassadors lined up to meet him. I remember Nasser walked down the line and was
                    perspiring heavily. It was June, but it was late afternoon and it wasn't that
                    humid... Anyway, he met with the King for two or three days and they signed some
                    kind of an agreement to patch things up. I went to the foreign office afterwards
                    and asked, “Well, what happened? You said the differences were irreconcilable.”
                    “Well, Nasser changed and we decided that we could work things out.” So that
                    ameliorated the situation, but as I recall differences broke out again and it
                    wasn't until a year or two later that they finally decided to kiss and make up.
                    My memory is vague on this. But I do remember this incident in 1965, which was a
                    temporary ameliorative. I don't think it was a permanent one, that came
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else through 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The British at that time were trying to create independent entities both
                    in south Yemen and in the Gulf which could survive them. The British saw the
                    handwriting on the wall. I am trying to remember the date the British pulled out
                    of the Gulf. But in any case in Yemen they created a South Arabian Federation,
                    which was an amalgam of the various tribal leaders and of the Aden people. The
                    British remained as the tutors. I remember attending one of their sessions when
                    I was out there in 1961 and the British were guiding the ministers. And we were
                    following the situation closely. In Aden there was a reformist movement headed
                    by a young nationalist leader by the name of Abdullah Asnag who was a relative
                    moderate. The British thought he was a consummate radical and wouldn't have
                    anything to do with him. They had created this South Arabian Federation which
                    they thought would be the wave of the future. The trouble was that the South
                    Arabian Federation was composed of tribal leaders of the old school and the
                    world was changing, the Middle East was changing. Nationalists everywhere were
                    taking over.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I and Harry Symmes, who was deputy office director, felt that we should urge the
                    British to take another look at Asnag and consider dealing with him. He was not
                    a communist, he was really a reformist-nationalist. The British said, “No, he is
                    a radical.” So we had some real differences with the British on this. They
                    thought that we were trying to undercut them because of what Harry and I were
                    doing. Of course the British embassy always has somebody who comes in and talks
                    to us about Middle East affairs and the Foreign Office were talking to our
                    embassy people.</p>
                <p>We thought that we were being honest and helpful to the British on this, but they
                    apparently didn't think so. At one point...Hermann Eilts, who was then our
                    Middle East man at the London embassy, sent a message back to NEA saying, “The
                    British are upset at Seelye and Symmes because they keep arguing vigorously that
                    the Foreign Office should pay more attention to this leader.” Well, as things
                    turned out the British turned their shoulder on him and I think threw him in
                    jail. Ultimately a more radical movement evolved in Yemen that was Marxist. To
                    make a long story short, the Marxists took over and the South Arabian Federation
                    was cast by the wayside.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A long lasting, very nasty regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Asnag eventually fled to North Yemen and turned out to be a very
                    reasonable guy. Had the British paid attention to us, I think things would have
                    developed quite differently in Aden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this do you think there was something almost
                        endemic within the British Near Eastern experts, the Arabists...they really
                        loved the desert and the tribal chiefs. I noticed this in my short
                        experience in Saudi Arabia. They certainly got into the tribal psyche. Our
                        Arabists didn't get into the desert Arab and the tribal chieftain thing.
                        Could you talk a little about this from your observation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, one thing that did work out, I have to give the British credit, was
                    the bringing together of the Persian Gulf Sheikdoms which eventually became the
                    United Arab Emirates. Conceivably the same thing could have happened there.
                    However one difference, I think, was that the tribal sheikdoms found oil, some
                    of them at least, and fortunately in some cases had enlightened leaders and
                    began to use the oil revenues wisely. Kuwait was the most dramatic example.
                    Bahrain didn't have that much oil but the British wisely developed a very
                    sensible way of using the revenues there and the ruling family was enlightened.
                    When, for example, in Abu Dhabi which had tremendous oil potential, the ruler
                    there, Sheik Shakhbut, refused to move with the times.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SEELYE: ...the British moved him aside and brought in Zayid, who was willing to
                    modernize. So I think the fact that oil revenues enabled the Persian Gulf
                    Sheikdoms to have the wherewithal, plus enlightened leadership, prevented the
                    same thing from happening in the Gulf that happened in Aden. The British effort
                    to bring together the tribal sheikhs in an entity succeeded.</p>
                <p>Well, you asked about the relationship of Foreign Service Officers to the tribal
                    business. I don't think anybody ever fell in love with tribes.</p>
                <p>You say you haven't read the Kaplan book, well, don't read it. It is
                    inaccurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about a book, the Kaplan book, “The
                        Arabists,” which has a picture of you on the cover. From all accounts you
                        have read it but I am trying to get it out of the library. It apparently is
                        attacking the Arabist influence of our officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Kaplan claims that we were out of touch with reality and that we were
                    romanticists, too much in love with the desert Arabs. I have had two exchanges
                    with the author about this. In any case I don't think that FSO's had any love
                    affair with the tribes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never felt that, but I felt the British...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: They had their famous romantic figures in the 19th century, of course.
                    But I am not sure all British foreign Service people felt that way. The new
                    generation came along and was attuned to reality. I think the Arabists who
                    became the key players in the British foreign service by the time the sixties
                    came along had a realistic outlook. Of course, those who created the South
                    Arabian Federation were of the old school. The British Arab experts that I dealt
                    with in the sixties and seventies were very much realists and very able people.
                    For a while in the British foreign service they took the brightest diplomats and
                    put them into Arabic studies. That explained why so many of the British
                    diplomats who moved up to the top echelons and became permanent under
                    secretaries were Arabists. I don't think they do that anymore. So the British
                    had top people assigned to the area in my time and they were bright enough to
                    know not to be taken in by old fashioned views.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SEELYE: It came later. When I was in Saudi Arabia at one point we were discussing
                    what we should do in terms of approaching the British again on what was going on
                    in Aden. I remember this because Hermann Eilts was Ambassador and he asked me to
                    meet with him, the station chief and others, because things were unraveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a real nasty little war, kind of like

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I felt that the British were wrong in what they were doing because the
                    radicals were gaining strength. The station chief took the British position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the desk when President Kennedy was
                        assassinated. How did this impact on your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, it impacted, of course, very much as it did everywhere. People were
                    just shocked, and disheartened and we had long lines at the embassy in Jeddah
                    waiting to sign the book, and in Kuwait, etc. I personally had had maybe three
                    encounters with the President which made me personally quite upset. The first
                    encounter was the meeting with King Saud when he was in the rocking chair. Then
                    later at dinner I talked with him. He was so human in both cases and so
                    interested in what I had to say. And the way he treated me when I was taking
                    notes, instead of being peremptory, he just sort of whispered in a very nice
                    way. Then I remember once being out at Andrews Air Force Base when he was
                    returning from somewhere. I don't know why I was there, it must have had
                    something to do with the Middle East. I was in line with maybe ten people, at
                    the tail end and I had my gloves on, it was winter. He came all the way down the
                    line and I had to take off my gloves to shake hands with him. That was a very
                    nice personal touch.</p>
                <p>His death was a shock in the Middle East. It had no impact on policy, although
                    certainly Lyndon Johnson never had the interest in the Middle East that Kennedy
                    had. Let us remember that when Kennedy was a Senator in 1958 he spoke out in
                    favor of Algerian independence. I think that this kind of sympathy carried on
                    when he reached the White House. This was reflected in his spending one hundred
                    hours on the Yemen/Saudi/Egyptian situation, if indeed he did.</p>

                        period? Or was it even a play?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SEELYE: During the fifties there was very much a cold war context to Middle East
                    policy. We had the Baghdad Pact which fell apart. It was kind of a precursor of
                    the Kissinger years and the cold war projected to the Middle East. Looking at
                    the sixties, I don't remember sensing a cold war context to our Middle East
                    policy. Our policy focused more on indigenous problems. I think at that time we
                    realistically realized that the Soviets were not the prime movers of the
                    problems out there. Nasser had his own reasons for undermining the Arab
                    conservative regimes. Even though he had good relations with the Soviets, I
                    don't think we sensed that the Soviets were pushing him in this direction
                    although they welcomed it. With regard to the revolt in Yemen, I didn't sense
                    any Soviet involvement. So it is interesting that you asked because I don't
                    think in the sixties that the Soviet factor loomed so large in U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is indicative that you were dealing with these

                        the Persian Gulf, or something like that, at that time. What about the role
                        of the Israeli lobby and our policy? Did it have much of an impact in the
                        area you were in charge of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I was, of course, in Arabian Peninsula Affairs and that was sort of out
                    of that orbit. Obviously the Israelis were not well-disposed towards Saudi
                    Arabia, but I didn't sense in terms of our relations with Saudi Arabia or Yemen
                    or Kuwait that that was a major factor. In any case, the lobby was not as strong
                    in those days, it became strong later. Even during my short tenure on the
                    Jordan-Iraq desk, it wasn't something that I was aware of. So in the 1960's I
                    didn't sense that the lobby had an impact on Arabian Peninsula Affairs.</p>
                <p>Let's go back, however, to 1954—this is an interesting anecdote as a footnote to
                    history and I don't think I mentioned it before in my earlier comments. At that
                    time Jordan and Israeli affairs were combined in one desk. In 1952, when I went
                    to Jordan, the desk officer was a gentleman who had just come out of Haifa,
                    where he had been consul. He was at the desk throughout the two years I was in
                    Jordan. And then in 1955 or late 1954, he was summarily dismissed from the
                    Foreign Service. Why? Because he was caught passing a confidential document to
                    an official at the Israeli embassy. I mention that because that never happened
                    after that. We know that plenty of classified documents were passed with
                    impunity to the Israelis, not necessarily by Foreign Service officers, but by
                    Defense Department officers and others. So it became a common thing. But in the
                    1950's the action was considered so shocking and the lobby was so weak that this
                    guy was fired. Had that happened ten or fifteen years later, he would still be a
                    Foreign Service officer, I'm sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously oil was on our main agenda there. How did we
                        view the oil situation during this time? You had Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
                        which took care of a significant bit of the oil in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SEELYE: At that point, of course, oil was very inexpensive, very cheap. It was
                    about $1.50 a barrel. I remember when I was in Kuwait there was talk about the
                    oil producers getting together, and at that point they called it pro-rationing,
                    before OPEC was created.</p>
                <p>Well, I don't think that oil was a big political issue at that point because the
                    oil producers were just beginning to talk about working together. There was no
                    sense that they were going to force the prices up and form a cartel, which
                    eventually happened. So I don't recall that we sensed that that was a potential
                    problem. Oil was flowing at a reasonable price and we were happy with it. There
                    was no pressure on the oil companies to change the terms of the oil agreements.
                    I remember when the oil was just beginning to be developed in Dubai, about 1963
                    maybe, and Continental was going out to look for oil. One of the sheiks of Dubai
                    was here and we entertained him and Continental officials. Everything seemed to
                    be working fine in terms of the availability of oil and the relationship of the
                    oil companies with the host governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left the desk in 1964 and went to the War
                        College. You were there from 1964-65. What was the interest at the War
                        College? Did they draw on you much for the Middle East or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, they didn't. I don't recall anybody particularly focusing in on that.
                    In those days you had an IRP to write, a research paper, and I did mine on the
                    instruments of diplomacy used in negotiating and mediating three disputes. I
                    used Yemen as one example, based on my own experience; and Cyprus and Kashmir.
                    But the Yemen component was my only Middle East focus at the War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to Jeddah from 1965-68 where you
                        served as deputy chief of mission. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I don't know how that came about. I remember Harry Symmes, then Director
                    of NE, calling me and saying, “We have in mind sending you to Jeddah as DCM.” I
                    said, “Fine.” At that point Parker Hart had just completed his tour as
                    ambassador and Nick Thacher was completing his tour as deputy chief of mission.
                    So as it so often happens the two top people at the embassy leave at the same
                    time. But Nick stayed until I got there. Bill Porter was appointed as the
                    successor to Parker Hart. In retrospect it surprises me that I didn't meet with
                    Bill Porter before my assignment. They must have said they had in mind sending
                    Seelye and here is what he is like or something, and he said, “Fine.” Because
                    normally, as you know, the ambassador has an important say in who his DCM is.
                    However, he never arrived because shortly after I arrived in Jeddah in June, our
                    Ambassador then in Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, decided he wanted a senior and
                    experienced Foreign Service officer to help him out. He realized that if he
                    wanted a man of that stature he couldn't be just DCM so he created for the first
                    time in U.S. diplomatic history a deputy ambassador position with the rank of
                    ambassador. So Ambassador Porter, who had been Ambassador elsewhere, was called
                    off the assignment to Jeddah and went off to Vietnam. And that is why I was
                    Charg� d'affaires for six months because then they had to drum up a new
                    ambassador, Hermann Eilts. Nick Thacher and I overlapped about a week and then
                    he left and I was Charg� from June until Eilts arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Saudi Arabia during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It was a very interesting time because while I was Charg� the Yemen thing
                    was again acting up; I mentioned that Nasser came to call and there was a
                    temporary improvement in the Egyptian-Saudi relationship. I remember having to
                    go to see King Faisal—the King always went to Ta'if over the summer, it is north
                    of Jeddah up in the mountains and is cooler. I flew up there to make a demarche
                    on him, presumably concerning Yemen. The fact that he would see a Charg� was a
                    measure of the U.S.-Saudi relationship because normally a Charg� never gets to
                    see a chief of state.</p>
                <p>So we were still back and forth on Yemen. But the most dramatic thing that
                    happened during my tenure there of six months as Charg� was the beginning of
                    Saudi-U.S. military sales. Of course we had had a military training mission in
                    Saudi Arabia for a long time, but it was in 1965 when Saudi Arabia first
                    purchased arms from the United States. The Saudis decided that they wanted a
                    defense umbrella composed of fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The
                    Saudis specifically asked for Lockheed F-104s as their fighter aircraft and Hawk
                    surface-to-air missiles made by Raytheon. The experts in Washington felt that
                    the Hawk missiles were entirely appropriate for Saudi Arabia. They were the
                    latest state of the art but not so complicated that we might not be able to
                    train the Saudis to handle them. But the F-104s were considered to be
                    inappropriate for the Saudis. They were a complex aircraft. They were crashing
                    all over Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a terrible problem. They were called the
                        StarFighters and the Germans called them the widow makers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That's right. So we were trying to discourage the Saudis from purchasing
                    them. I was a bystander at that point, sitting in Jeddah. Then I got a message
                    saying, “We have got to try to persuade the Saudis to buy F-5s instead of the
                    F-104s, so we are sending out a team of Air Force officers headed by Chuck
                    Yeager [a hotshot test pilot] to meet with the Saudi air force people and to try
                    to persuade them to buy the F-5s.” So he comes out, a charming guy. He meets
                    with the Saudis and succeeds in persuading every air force officer there, except
                    the chief of the air force, Colonel Hashim, that the F-5 should be obtained.
                    Hashim dug in his heels. It had to be the F-104. Well, we couldn't figure out
                    why. Yeager and I would get together and try to figure out why. It turned out
                    later that the reason Hashim was holding out was because Lockheed had paid him
                    $100,000. It never occurred to me at the time that there might be a payoff
                    involved. Later, of course, Northrop made payoffs too. They all gave payoffs.
                    The British more so.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we reported the Saudis refusal to purchase the F-5s back to Washington.
                    By that time all the Saudi ministries had moved to Riyadh, with the exception of
                    the foreign ministry which was still in Jeddah. The Saudis didn't want the
                    embassies up in Riyadh quite yet because they didn't think Riyadh was quite
                    ready for such a foreign invasion. They were going to wait until they had built
                    a ghetto, a kind of big park where all the embassies would be isolated. So at
                    that point if you wanted to deal with anyone outside the foreign ministry you
                    had to go up to Riyadh. Finally, after much stewing around, Washington sent me a
                    cable saying, “Okay, you are authorized to go up to Riyadh, to the ministry of
                    defense, and tell the minister that the United States would after all sell them
                    F-104s since the Saudis insisted.. I went to Riyadh to present the package to
                    Prince Sultan, and returned to Jeddah.</p>
                <p>The following day I received a cable saying, “Hold everything. We have an
                    alternative package to present to the Saudis. This will include the Hawk
                    missiles but it will now include British aircraft, Lightnings. You are therefore
                    instructed, and a separate message has gone to the British Ambassador, Morgan
                    Mann, to jointly visit Sultan and put before him this alternative package.” I
                    went back with the message, “Well, which one should I favor?” The answer was,
                    “You are supposed to give equal weight to both packages.”</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>So a couple of days later I went to Riyadh again, this time with Morgan Mann.
                    With Morgan Mann was a representative of the British Aircraft Corporation. I
                    thought it was very strange for him to be taking somebody representing the
                    aircraft manufacturer. I think this guy went into the meeting with us.
                    Extraordinary. So we went in to see Prince Sultan and Mann did most of the
                    talking because it was a new package involving the British. I indicated to
                    Sultan that we supported this package with equal weight as the package I had
                    presented to him a few days earlier. Sultan looked at me kind of puzzled and
                    asked, “If we should choose this package, which is half British and half
                    American, what does this do to the U.S. military umbrella?” Well, as far as I
                    knew, we didn't have any explicit commitment on this score. Ever since the Hard
                    Surface operation there had been an assumption that we would come to Saudi
                    Arabia's aid militarily if needed, but nothing in writing. Without instructions
                    I replied, “This would not affect our military umbrella.”</p>
                <p>As we were leaving the meeting, Sultan called me back into his office and asked,
                    “What goes on here?” I said, “All I can tell you is that I have been instructed
                    to inform you that we give equal weight to both packages.”</p>
                <p>On the plane returning to Jeddah the British Ambassador and I drafted a brief
                    communiqu� to be read over the Saudi radio that evening about the joint US-UK
                    package that had just been presented to King Faisal. I don't think we ever made
                    an announcement about our package but Mann wanted to make an announcement about
                    the joint package. He said, “Do you mind if we put the word UK before US in the
                    announcement?” I said, “Morgan, I couldn't care less. Do it any way you want to
                    do it.” The announcement was handed over to the Jeddah radio station to be
                    broadcast in both English and Arabic. It just so happened by coincidence that
                    the announcer for the English language news was an American who had been an
                    English language teacher in Jeddah and had taken on this job. And the news came
                    on about 6:00 p.m. I wasn't paying any attention to it, I didn't listen to it.
                    Apparently it referred to the “US-UK” package.</p>
                <p>Suddenly about 7:00 I got a heated call from Morgan Mann saying, “What are you
                    doing? You have gotten your man to put “US” before “UK” in the announcement.” I
                    said, “Morgan, you must be kidding. I told you I didn't care which came first.”
                    He said, “You have done it purposely and betrayed me.” I said, “Listen, Morgan.
                    I have done nothing of the sort.” He hung up on me in high dudgeon. So I called
                    our PAO, George Thompson, and asked him to go to the station and find out what
                    happened. George hightailed it down there and then called me and said, “The
                    American announcer read exactly as it was handed to him.” I asked, “Who prepared
                    the thing?” “I don't know, some Palestinian, I think,” came the response. So I
                    called Morgan and said, “Morgan, this is what happened. You can believe it or
                    not. The American announcer, who is not my man but an independent operator, was
                    handed a piece of paper that had “US” before “UK.” He did not initiate the
                    change. Just a silly little vignette.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Later on I discovered that the reason for proposing the second package was that
                    McNamara, who was then Secretary of Defense, was trying to sell to the British
                    an experimental aircraft that was no longer experimental. It was not in
                    production. This was the F-111, which was a swing-wing aircraft and which was
                    flown off aircraft carriers as well as off ground airfields. The British were
                    not inclined to buy it and McNamara needed more buyers to justify the F-111
                    assembly line. So McNamara proposed to the British that if they would buy the
                    F-111's, we would help them sell their aircraft to Saudi Arabia. The trouble was
                    that this happened after we had told the Saudis that we were going to sell them
                    our all-American package.</p>
                <p>Well, the British aircraft representative helped the British sale by paying off
                    Sultan. The Saudis decided to buy the Lightnings, which turned out to be an
                    highly ineffective aircraft. In fact, they were never used. Much, much later the
                    Saudis bought some F-5s. So that's the story of the first Saudi-US arms
                    deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we are going to call this off here. What we really
                        have is your time as DCM, as Charg�, and then we will talk about things
                        after you ended up in Jeddah when Hermann Eilts came on board.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 13, 1993. In our last interview we were
                        talking about you being Charg� in Jeddah and the problem about military
                        sales to the Saudis. Why don't we pick it up from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Okay. The other important issue that I recall during my tenure as Charg�
                    was the fact there were still tensions in Yemen. I think I mentioned that Nasser
                    at one point tried to patch up differences with Faisal. That worked for a while
                    but then it fell apart. I remember having to go and see King Faisal in Ta'if,
                    the summer residence for the palace, on some crucial issue dealing with Yemen.
                    Omar Saqqaf, the Foreign Minister, had a peculiar habit. He would get to the
                    Foreign Ministry rather late in the morning and then I would suddenly get a call
                    from him, say about 11:00, and he would say, “Come to my office, I want to see
                    you immediately.” Well, it took about fifteen minutes to get from the embassy
                    compound to the foreign office. So I will say the Saudis did deal at high levels
                    with an American Charg� because of our good relationship with them. I didn't
                    find that not being the Ambassador was a disadvantage at the time in dealing
                    with the Saudis.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>This is an interesting side affair which isn't political, but we had a problem at
                    the embassy there. Back in the late sixties they were starting a DCM course at
                    the FSI. They wanted case studies of problems that DCMs faced so that they could
                    be played out in the course. I gave them one from my Jeddah experience which
                    concerned the wife of the chief of station, who was a great pain-in-the-neck.
                    She was of Lebanese origin and she had some close female friends who were
                    Lebanese married to leading Saudi merchants. She started spreading the word that
                    I was junior to her husband. She happened to be a very strong Christian
                    Maronite. The Maronites have long dominated Lebanon and have not always been in
                    sync with the best interests of the Lebanese body politic. The United States has
                    often been upset with some of their shenanigans. She alleged that I was somehow
                    anti-Maronite and was to be viewed with suspicion. And not only that, she began
                    to attack “the embassy” as a whole. Well, as you know CIA station chiefs tend to
                    have cover ranks that are lower than their positions in the Agency. Anyway she
                    was spreading gossip that was harmful and embarrassing for the embassy. She was
                    undercutting the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you getting this information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: My wife was picking it up mainly. I deliberated as to what to do. This
                    was near the end of my tenure as Charg� and Hermann Eilts was coming in as
                    Ambassador. So I decided to hold off doing anything until he arrived. My wife
                    had a particularly hard time with her. I felt that what she was doing was
                    turning certain Saudis against me. Furthermore, not only that, but it turned out
                    she was running a kind of high-class brothel. There were a couple of diplomats
                    there, and I won't identify their nationalities, one was an ambassador, who had
                    the “hots” for the wives of some other diplomats and she would facilitate their
                    little trysts in her home. She would let them go there where they would not be
                    seen. That did not exactly go down well for the reputation of the American
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this also became known?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Of course it got out. So the Ambassador arrived and after he had been
                    there for a while I said, “Hermann, this is the situation and my recommendation
                    is that we request that the station chief be transferred so that we can get his
                    wife out of here.” Well, understandably, I guess, Hermann said, “Well, look, I
                    am new here, I haven't experienced this, so really I should have to experience
                    it myself, feel it, know about it first hand before taking any action.” Once
                    Hermann got there, of course, the wife of the station chief didn't attack him
                    and no word was spread in the community that Hermann Eilts was anti-Maronite or
                    anything like that. He didn't pick up any of the stories about the brothel, so
                    the net result was that they hung on. And while the station chief was okay and a
                    good officer, his wife continued to act up and caused my wife a lot of
                    problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I thought that should be done by the Ambassador, frankly. But he
                    didn't feel he wanted to, so nobody talked to the station chief. I probably made
                    a mistake not talking to him before that. But I guess I felt that if I had
                    spoken to him it might have caused friction and difficulty and with the
                    Ambassador coming, maybe that would be hard on him, etc. For one reason or
                    another I didn't talk to him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hermann Eilts arrives. He had been in charge of Saudi

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: He took over Saudi affairs in 1958-61 and I took over from him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he appeared on the scene did he have an agenda that
                        was coming from Washington or did he just arrive and take it as it
                        came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I don't think that he had an agenda. He didn't come from being in charge
                    of Saudi affairs, he had been in London as our Middle East man before that. So I
                    don't know that he had any special program except to do what an ambassador does
                    to promote relations and carry on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: He was terrific. We got along beautifully. I always liked and admired him
                    tremendously. Hermann, of course, was a man of tremendous abilities. He had a
                    very fertile mind and when he would walk into the office in the morning he
                    already had ideas. Immediately he would call his secretary and start dictating.
                    After dictating a couple of cables to his secretary he would call in my
                    secretary and dictate to her, which didn't bother me at all. He just wanted to
                    get all these things out. That was his pattern in the morning. He would be
                    thinking over night. He was always very good with me and would show me his
                    drafts.</p>
                <p>I think he wanted me to run the embassy in terms of the administration and that
                    sort of thing, manage it. I think we teamed up pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We had some slightly different approaches to the dynamics of the Middle East.
                    Hermann was a very conservative person. He was a little more sympathetic to the
                    British position in Aden, which I think I discussed last time, and he was less
                    convinced than I was that the British should have cultivated this nationalist
                    who opposed the British, but who was a moderate nationalist. Hermann was
                    obsessed about Nasser, for example. Some of us had felt that while Nasser was a
                    force for a lot of evil in trying to overthrow friendly regimes, nevertheless,
                    given the social dynamics of the Middle East before he came along, he was a
                    reformer, he was a nationalist, so we saw some good sides to him. Thus we had
                    these slight differences of emphasis, but nothing of great importance.</p>
                <p>The most dramatic thing that happened during our joint tenure there was the 1967
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Known as the Six Day War, June, 1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The way it manifest itself at our embassy was one night at about 9:00
                    p.m. there was a big explosion. We lived in a compound so we all rushed to the
                    chancery and discovered that somebody had set off a bomb and blown up our
                    generator. But nobody was injured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Just as the war started. That caused concern in the official American
                    community and we pointed out that we thought this was an isolated incident. The
                    Foreign Ministry assigned some national guard troops to protect the embassy. The
                    Saudis investigated the matter but I can't remember if they found the culprits
                    or not. In any case, neither Hermann nor I felt that what happened in the war
                    would lead to disturbances of any significance in Saudi Arabia. While embassies
                    around the area were evacuating personnel, we resisted evacuation. Fortunately
                    we were able to persuade Washington that we should keep our people there in as
                    much as they were not in danger despite this one incident.</p>
                <p>Now, unfortunately, the Department has not always been as responsive. I was in
                    Syria later when there was panic in the Department because of a series of
                    tragedies in the Middle East affecting some embassies. As a result the
                    Department issued sweeping instructions that all embassies should clear out all
                    personnel without distinction. Fortunately in this case the Department accepted
                    our judgment that we should keep our people there but other posts equally secure
                    did not fare so well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Saudis reaction to the 1967 war?
                        Nasser more or less provoked the war insisting that the UN pull its troops
                        out. But it was right on the Saudi border that some of the action was
                        happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SEELYE: You could argue that the Israelis chose to be provoked by what Nasser
                    did, but there is also the argument that the Israelis had to react the way they
                    did. It is not clear whether Nasser intended to go to war.</p>
                <p>One didn't sense that the Saudis felt that they were close to any conflagration
                    or close to a crisis. Riyadh was a long way away from the battlefield. Obviously
                    there was sympathy among the Saudis for Nasser's action because of the fact that
                    there was anti-Israeli sentiment in Saudi Arabia. The government shared the
                    anti-Israeli sentiment but had a strong antagonism toward Nasser. We didn't face
                    the situation where the government issued an ultimatum saying, “Look, you have
                    to support Nasser on this and condemn Israel for that.” As I recall, the Saudis
                    did not make a big issue of that because they already had their problems with
                    Nasser. I know that the local employees in our embassy were terribly upset. We
                    had one local employee who resigned. He was a Sudanese working for USIA and
                    resigned in the belief that the United States had collaborated with Israel. As
                    you recall a big myth that was spread throughout the area alleged that the U.S.
                    had helped Israel in its wiping out the Egyptian air force and in defeating
                    Egypt. This was widely believed at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is still widely believed, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: And in some sense in retrospect it may be right because we now
                    understand, although we do not have 100 percent proof, that at the time an
                    American AWAC-type aircraft was sent to Israel and had Israeli markings on it
                    and was put up in the air to help the Israelis identify Egyptian airfields and
                    the location of planes. So, if that is true, and there are people who believe it
                    is true—although people like Dick Helms and others claim it is poppycock—if it
                    is true, then there is some substance to the belief that the U.S. collaborated
                    at least in a limited sense.</p>
                <p>I think there was one incident in the eastern province at that time which the
                    Saudis put down quite quickly, but I can't recall what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to some of the other things that were mentioned
                        before, you say Ambassador Eilts would come in and dictate cables...its nice
                        for someone to have great thoughts and all but Saudi Arabia wasn't on the
                        absolute front burner of the United States...what happened with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I can't really say because I don't know how people in Washington took
                    them. Certainly the desk officers and other people in NEA read them. They gave a
                    flavor of what the Saudis were thinking and planning and that sort of thing.
                    Obviously cables were screened for the Assistant Secretary, how many of them he
                    saw, I don't know. But Saudi-American relations in terms of Middle East-American
                    relations loom fairly large. They would loom larger later on than they did then.
                    Given the perceived threat from Nasser and the Yemen problem, there was a little
                    more focus on Saudi Arabia at that time than there had been, let's say five or
                    ten years before. But how Washington reacted, I don't remember or didn't know. I
                    can't answer that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression and Eilts's impression about the
                        effectiveness of the Saudi government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Its interesting because Faisal had taken over a couple of years before I
                    got there. He came in with a firm hand and a sense of orderliness toward
                    finances. He started to check the erosion in Saudi Arabia that had been
                    reflected at one time in the sixties with the defection of one Saudi prince and
                    a couple of pilots. So Faisal was putting the country back together.
                    Nevertheless by 1966, about three years after he had taken over, we were still
                    not sure to what extent Saudi stability was secure. I recall sitting down with
                    Dick Murphy, a political officer, and brainstorming as to how long we thought
                    this Saudi regime would last. I remember in a very cautious way we projected
                    that it could certainly last five years, but in a ten-year time frame we were
                    less certain. As one looks back it is really quite amusing that we were so
                    cautious because the regime proved to be quite stable and has lasted a long
                    time. That was almost thirty years ago. But this was just after the period of
                    Faisal's taking over and the Yemen disturbances. So we were still not totally
                    confident that the regime could hold on. But obviously it did.</p>
                <p>In terms of looking at the regime, I do recall that the Minister of Interior in
                    those days was Fahd, who is now King. He was considered one of the more liberal
                    Saudi princes. In those days he was talking about having a consultative council
                    and opening up the society a bit. It is ironic he was talking that way in the
                    sixties and this only happened last year—in the early 1990s.</p>
                <p>Prince Sultan, Minister for Defense, was front and center for us because he was
                    handling military affairs.</p>
                <p>I don't think we sensed any real political ferment in Saudi Arabia at that point.
                    People were making money. The princes were being taken care of. Although Faisal
                    was very strong about controlling the princes, not letting them step out of line
                    or giving them too much money. After Faisal died, my understanding is that that
                    got a bit out of control. So Faisal operated with a very firm hand and he had
                    respect in Saudi Arabia, and I think that was a key factor that enabled Saudi
                    Arabia to move in a positive, stable direction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the 1967 war, were there any developments with
                        Nasser or Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I am trying to remember when it was played out. I think it was about 1968
                    when Faisal and Nasser finally buried the hatchet once and for all. I left
                    Jeddah in July, 1968 and it may have happened after I left. By that time the
                    Yemeni regime had been in power for six years or so and had become a little more
                    confident of its security and in itself. It was more willing to cut a deal. One
                    aspect of that deal was to allow some of the Yemenis who had opposed the
                    republic but not members of the royal family to return. But there remains a
                    ruling that no member of the Hamid al-Din royal family can return. There is only
                    one exception, and that concerns the Zabbara family in Sanaa. That is a
                    prominent merchant family which had been close to the royal family. The son of
                    the former Yemeni Charg�, a man named Muhammad Zabbara, married a member of the
                    royal family and because he was living in Yemen, teaching there, he was allowed
                    to bring her back. She is the only royal family member allowed to live in
                    Yemen.</p>

                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The Consul General in Dhahran was closer to ARAMCO than we were, but
                    there was an ARAMCO representative in Jeddah. He used to come in regularly,
                    almost every week, and we would compare notes. And, of course, the Consul
                    General was reporting his contacts with ARAMCO. We had pretty close contacts and
                    we used to exchange views when there were crises or problems. I think during the
                    1967 war the same thing happened. They wanted to know whether they should send
                    their people home and we recommended that they not. The remarkable thing to me
                    has always been that despite the fact that most of the ARAMCO employees in those
                    days were Shiites from the eastern province, a minority that had been really
                    mistreated by the government, during crises there were practically no incidents.
                    We had good relations with ARAMCO. We used to have tennis matches between ARAMCO
                    and the little Dunes Club in Jeddah—a club started by Ambassador Wadsworth. It
                    had a sand golf course that he built as well as a couple of crummy tennis
                    courts. I was more a tennis buff rather than golfer and got the courts improved.
                    As we built up our tennis facility we had matches with ARAMCO. That was fun and
                    it also created a social relationship between the embassy and ARAMCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the ARAMCO employees were at times
                        running their foreign policy and we were running ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SEELYE: No, I don't think so. You knew ARAMCO better than I since you were in
                    Dhahran, but my sense was that most of the ARAMCO employees were apolitical,
                    technicians and service people, who were somewhat isolated from Saudi Arabian
                    and Middle East politics. They enjoyed the perks, took off on long vacations and
                    had a kind of life of Riley. I didn't have any sense that the majority of ARAMCO
                    people reacted that much to what happened in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to over emphasize this and I am really
                        thinking about the political affairs people. Did you or Ambassador Eilts
                        ever have the feeling, “Come on fellows, get on board,” type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, I don't think we felt that. I have a feeling they kind of deferred to
                    the embassy on these things. I didn't sense any heated objections to us or what
                    the United States was doing. I think the ARAMCO people in government affairs all
                    recognized the domestic realities back here that controlled our policy in the
                    Middle East. Our only problem (minor) was that our Consul General in Dhahran
                    kept complaining about the embassy. I would have to go up and hold his hand
                    every now and then. He was always complaining about minutiae, such as about the
                    pouches or something. I thought that his complaints were somewhat amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on your time in Saudi Arabia, there were
                        restrictions on alcohol, on women, it is not the easiest environment. You
                        were in charge of the staff. Can you tell us any of the problems that
                        occurred because of the environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, to start, we had no liquor problems because we brought in our
                    liquor in bulk in zinc-lined crates. When I arrived I was told that there was an
                    understanding with the Foreign Ministry that it would not ask questions and we
                    would not ask questions. This, I think, applied to all diplomatic missions. So
                    the zinc-lining was to make sure that if the crate dropped on the wharf it
                    wouldn't leak. We were much better off than the Consulate General with regard to
                    our liquor privileges.</p>
                <p>Driving for women was a terrible problem. The only three individuals in the
                    embassy who had drivers were the Ambassador, the DCM, and the station chief. Of
                    course that marked him because everybody figured out that he must be the station
                    chief because he had a driver too. But we did arrange bus service into town for
                    the wives. The husbands who didn't have drivers would have to escort their wives
                    into town for shopping and that sort of thing. So it was a big handicap, no
                    question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention that our consul general in Dhahran, this
                        is 1958-60, Walter Schwinn, was able to get Saud Bin Jiluwi, the premier of
                        the eastern province at that time, to grant wives driving licenses because
                        he claimed that otherwise men would have to be doing women's work and it was
                        degrading to them. So my wife had a Saudi driving license.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: But just between the consulate general and ARAMCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, around the base. She couldn't drive outside the
                        immediate area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I remember Walter Schwinn. There was the famous incident where Walter
                    came back from Dhahran bringing a locker full of liquor and the customs people
                    wanted to open it and he sat on it and said, “Not on my life will I let you open
                    this.” I remember one of our wives at the embassy, who was an enterprising young
                    woman, once put on an Arab headdress so that she could drive without anyone
                    knowing she was a woman. A little bit risky, but she got away with it. I think
                    she did that a couple of times.</p>
                <p>We had a creek about 20 miles north of Jeddah which is in a bit from the Red Sea
                    where people rented ramshackle shacks, which to us was a great asset because we
                    could go swimming, snorkeling and sailing there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any great problems that you had with the
                        American community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, we had a bit of a problem with the so-called TWA community. The
                    Saudi Airlines was run by TWA. So TWA got contract employees to go out there and
                    fly and maintain the planes. There was a school that TWA started which the State
                    Department contributed to as part of helping American education abroad. We
                    always had somebody on the board of the school. But there was an almost
                    irreconcilable problem of the people at TWA resenting the embassy people because
                    we had liquor and also the usual feeling that diplomats are snooty and are not
                    real Americans. But we did our best. In fact, I made a great effort to try to
                    overcome that by getting to know them and entertaining them. We played softball
                    with them and that sort of thing, trying to break down this sort of barrier. I
                    remember that one of my people who I had assigned to be on the board would come
                    back wringing his hands after some meetings. We had very close relations with
                    the head of the TWA office, who would come regularly to compare notes and to
                    seek guidance. So relations were certainly not all bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any difficult arrest cases while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SEELYE: We had one fascinating case. We heard through the grapevine that an
                    American had been arrested down along the southern coast of the Red Sea at a
                    place called Yanbu. At first we couldn't get to the heart of it. We kept going
                    to the Foreign Ministry and asking if it was true. Finally, a foreign minister
                    looked into it and confirmed that there was indeed an American being held down
                    in Yanbu. We said, “Well, for God's sake release him.” So they finally released
                    him and he came up to Jeddah and we took care of him for a few days and he told
                    us his tale.</p>
                <p>He was a single sailor on a sail boat. He was sailing up the Red Sea coast and,
                    of course, at night he anchored offshore. I think in terms of maritime law, you
                    are allowed to anchor in territorial waters without a passport or visa. Well, he
                    had just anchored maybe a hundred yards off shore near a town 200 miles or so
                    south of Jeddah. He saw two or three people waving, and beckoning to him. So he
                    got into his little dingy and paddled ashore. They said, “What are you doing? We
                    have to take you to our police station.” They were very nice to him. The police
                    didn't know what to do with him so they called their headquarters for guidance.
                    They were told to hold him while headquarters checked into the matter. Anyway,
                    to make the story short, the poor guy was kept in Yanbu waiting for instructions
                    from headquarters as to what to do with him. They didn't mistreat him. They fed
                    him well. They offered him young boys, he said, which he refused. For a whole 30
                    days he was held in reasonably good conditions while the Saudi police waited for
                    instructions. Finally word came down to release him and to bring him to Jeddah.
                    So they brought him to Jeddah by land and towed his boat. They wouldn't let him
                    sail to Jeddah.</p>
                <p>Then we had a problem of how to get him out of Saudi Arabia. You cannot get an
                    exit visa unless you have an entry visa. He didn't have an entry visa. I think
                    it took us another ten days before we finally got the Saudi bureaucracy to
                    accept the fact that he could not have had an entry visa because he was not
                    there formally. We finally sprung him loose. I said to him, “I hope you write
                    your story some day.” I wish I had kept his name and address. I have never read
                    his story anywhere, but he must have a fascinating tale to tell.</p>
                <p>That's the only arrest case that I recall in Jeddah or Riyadh, although I guess
                    in Dhahran there may have been some cases during my time, but they were handled
                    by the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then came back to Near Eastern Affairs. You never
                        really got yourself out of the Near East. There was never any of this
                        so-called balance type thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, as you recall, Secretary Kissinger at one point introduced what he
                    called GLOP to get people out of areas that they specialized in. My
                    understanding was that he did this not because of the Middle East hands but more
                    because of the Latin American hands, but it applied to all regions. It just so
                    happened that I went from one Middle East posting to another. I didn't ask for
                    any of these things. In those days you didn't seek assignments the way you do
                    now.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Before I left Jeddah I did have correspondence with the Department about going to
                    Baghdad as Charg�, once relations were restored, because in 1967 relations were
                    broken. Somehow we thought relations would soon be restored. Before my tour was
                    up Washington decided that I would be sent to Baghdad as Charg�. Well, my three
                    years were up and Baghdad hadn't opened up. One proposal was that I should go to
                    Beirut and wait there. Thank God I didn't because I would have been waiting
                    until 1973. Instead the Department decided that it would bring me back and put
                    me in charge of what they called Arabian North Affairs, which covered Syria,
                    Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. I took Bob Houghton's place in August, 1968.</p>
                <p>This was at the end of the Johnson Administration. Just after I came into NEA,
                    Ambassador Pete Hart was brought back from Turkey to be Assistant Secretary.
                    This was unfair to him because it was just as administrations were changing,
                    during a phasing out and a phasing in period. Then when the new Administration
                    came in William Rogers was appointed as Secretary of State. He had gotten to
                    know Joe Sisco when the latter had been Assistant Secretary for International
                    Organizations Affairs. Rogers had been a member of the American UN delegation
                    one year and had gotten to know Sisco then. He decided to replace Pete Hart with
                    Sisco as Assistant Secretary of NEA. This was tough on Hart because he had only
                    been there a few months. Pete Hart became head of FSI for a while and then left
                    the Service.</p>
                <p>David Korn alludes to Sisco's takeover of NEA in his book that I reviewed for the
                    Foreign Service Journal on the Israeli-Egyptian war of attrition of 1968-71. The
                    one exception that I took to the book was the allegation that the so-called
                    Arabists in NE (the four office directors) viewed Sisco with considerable
                    apprehension. The four of us were Roy Atherton, Bill Brewer, Dick Parker and
                    myself. Well, I had no particular apprehension about Sisco because I had never
                    dealt with him. I didn't really know him at all. Maybe Dick Parker had some
                    apprehensions, I think he might have had some dealings with him before I got
                    there. Pete Hart was a good man and somebody who knew the area and he was
                    leaving and somebody who didn't know the area was coming in. So there was bound
                    to be some concern. Once Sisco was entrenched, at least two of us felt he was
                    okay.</p>
                <p>Sisco, I think, by the same token, was a little apprehensive about the office
                    directors. Could he rely on their loyalty? Were they hopelessly pro-Arab? This
                    sort of thing probably went through his mind. But, as he acknowledges in the
                    Kaplan book, the office directors served him well. Although he did make one
                    reference in the book—and I have taken him up on it—to the effect that Davies,
                    Parker and Seelye couldn't draft on this or that in dealings with Congress. I
                    sent Sisco a faxed copy of his alleged statement to Kaplan saying that what he
                    had meant to say was that the three of us were probably better suited to deal
                    with the Middle East region than with Congress. In any case, some of us got
                    along with Sisco and some of us didn't. I think this has been true anywhere
                    where Sisco has been. He is very dynamic, very forceful, an operator par
                    excellence within a bureaucracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I recall in my case, shortly after he got there, that we had a crisis in Lebanon.
                    He called all the office directors in, not just me because he didn't know me. He
                    said, “What do we do? What do we do?” We all talked. I realized that I had to
                    establish myself, obviously, otherwise every time something happened in Lebanon
                    all my colleagues would be pulled into the room with me. I recall going back and
                    thinking about it and preparing a guidance message to the embassy in Beirut. It
                    was all ready to go out the night before but I thought I would hold it. The next
                    morning, sure enough, Sisco called in all the office directors again. I had
                    about half a dozen copies of the draft cable and said, “Well, Joe, here is what
                    I propose,” and passed out the copies of the cable. He read it and said, “Just
                    right, that is what I like.” So from then on whenever there was something
                    happening in my area of responsibility he would call me in alone. So I had
                    established myself.</p>
                <p>But we hit it off fortunately and I had no problems with him. He shouted at a lot
                    of people and ranted, but rarely at me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that he came in with an agenda or was he an
                        operator is an operator—wherever he was was the center of the universe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I found after he trusted us, and me, particularly, he began to listen and
                    respond positively. And that was good. In fact, when I got to Tunisia several
                    years later, the British Ambassador who was there said to me, “Well, I just saw
                    our file on you. One thing I remember about your file is that they said you were
                    one of the office directors that Sisco listened to.” How the British came up
                    with that I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>One of the advantages of having Sisco there was that if you got him on your side
                    he was able to swing other key people around. He also was very close to Rogers.
                    Sisco was also able to handle Kissinger, who was over at the White House. I
                    recall one time when I got him pointed in the right direction. The automatic
                    reaction, unfortunately, of people at the highest level of government was that
                    when there was a crisis in the Middle East the Sixth Fleet would be alerted and
                    then moved close to the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. Also the 82nd
                    Airborne Division at Fort Bragg would be alerted. This would be publicized
                    without any consideration being given to whether these actions might have a
                    negative reaction in the Arab world. I remember going into Sisco saying, “Look,
                    for God's sake don't do this, or if we are going to do it, don't announce it.”
                    Sisco finally agreed with me and picked up the phone to call Kissinger. He told
                    me to get on the other line. He said, “Henry, we can't move the Sixth Fleet and
                    I will tell you why.” He gave him the reason I had given him. Kissinger said,
                    “Is there anyone on this line?” Joe said, “Nope.” “Well, Joe, I have to tell you
                    that I have already told the President that we have moved the Sixth Fleet. Joe,
                    I don't care if you only move the Fleet one mile, but just move it to the
                    minimum necessary because I have already told the President.” So we moved the
                    Sixth Fleet a few miles. Then of course I kept worrying about when we would turn
                    it back. That was a problem. It took us days to finally tell the Sixth Fleet
                    that it didn't have to move any further and could turn back. That was an example
                    of how you could get to Sisco.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are saying this looking at books on Kissinger and all,
                        there seemed to be, particularly at this time, much more, almost like
                        children in a way...this telephone bit. Alexander Haig and Larry Eagleburger
                        were kind of monitoring what Kissinger was saying and the NSC would kind of
                        laugh. These were very serious matters, but the way they were being treated
                        by these two powerful eagles and others around was something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, have you read Isaacson's book on Kissinger?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I read it having known Kissinger's paranoia and insecurity but I never
                    appreciated the extent of this that the book reveals. I shudder to think of
                    people like that running the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>In any case, I think Sisco held his own pretty well with Kissinger and in terms
                    of bureaucratic infighting. One of the things that Sisco was a past master at
                    was in what might be called “bull.” An Arab ambassador would come in to be
                    briefed and Sisco spoke as if he had all the answers. He would say, “One...
                    Number two... Number three... Number four...” After 45 minutes he made it look
                    as if we had all the answers and that everything was “hunky-dory.” The
                    ambassador would walk out impressed. You would walk him down the corridor and
                    downstairs to his car and then he would be reflecting, “I wonder what Sisco
                    really said.” Sisco just had a way of saying a lot and saying little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: But keep in mind at that point Syria and Iraq had broken relations with
                    us, so most of our focus was on Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the 1968-72 period. The civil war had
                        not broken out in Lebanon yet had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It had not, but we still had problems then. For example, in December,
                    1968, in response to some Palestinian guerrilla probings across the border into
                    Israel, the Israelis came across and wiped out practically the whole Middle East
                    Airline fleet at the Beirut Airport. This, of course, upset the Lebanese and it
                    disturbed us. At that point in time we still had the guts, that is the State
                    Department had the guts, probably the last time, to condemn Israel publicly for
                    the action. I don't recall ever since then that we ever condemned Israel without
                    putting it in the context of “we deplore terrorism on both sides.” But in this
                    case we actually condemned the Israeli attack by itself. The Lebanese were quite
                    pleased with this. However, I got a call a few days later from a Rabbi in the
                    Mid West. He was very hostile and very aggressive as they tend to be when it
                    comes to the Middle East. Finally, after ranting and raving about our having
                    condemned Israel for this action, he said to me, “I want you to know that we
                    never turn the other cheek.” In that one moment I realized why Christianity had
                    succeeded. Both Islam and Judaism adhered to an eye-for-an-eye and
                    tooth-for-a-tooth mentality. Christianity ended the constant vendetta that
                    allows people to get along. To this day the Israelis and Arabs have the
                    eye-for-an-eye mentality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Israeli affairs and your affairs get along in the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I think we began to sense increasingly the power of the Zionist Lobby in
                    the U.S., something that had not been evident earlier. In addition, the Israelis
                    then had an Ambassador by the name of Yitzhak Rabin, currently Prime Minister,
                    who had extraordinary access during the Nixon Administration. I recall that
                    frequently when I went in to see Sisco he was on the phone to Rabin. And Rabin
                    was always coming up to see the Secretary, etc. So one sensed also that the
                    power of the Israeli embassy was quite considerable.</p>
                <p>At that time, however, there was no one Israeli Embassy official who made a great
                    effort to cultivate Near East office directors. Back in the early sixties there
                    was an Israeli attach� of Iraqi-Jewish extraction, by the name of Darbaim who
                    used to cultivate us desk officers. He used to take us out to lunch and we would
                    have Arabic meals and talk in Arabic and all and got to know him quite well.
                    Perhaps it was felt by the late 1960's that the Lobby could do a better job.</p>
                <p>It was during this period when the Rogers Plan was conceived, a plan based on UN
                    Security Council Resolution 242, which called for Israeli withdrawal from the
                    occupied territories in return for an Arab commitment to peace. The Plan moved
                    the Resolution to implementation. Sisco and Roy Atherton, who by then had moved
                    up to become a deputy assistant secretary, basically drafted the Plan and got
                    Rogers involved. Rogers went out to the region in 1971 to sell this plan to
                    Israel, Egypt and Jordan. I happened to be one of those who went along. One was
                    not aware at that point that Kissinger back at the White House was undermining
                    that plan. I learned that later in reading about it. But the plan failed and, of
                    course, one important reason why it failed was because Kissinger was telling the
                    Israelis from the White House not to pay any attention to it.</p>
                <p>The White House-Israeli connection was very strong. I wasn't aware of the extent
                    of it then but was aware that Rabin had a lot of influence on U.S.
                    officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Foreign Service this can happen that...the Middle
                        East if you boil it down as far as the United States is concerned, the
                        Israeli presence and its relations with the other Arab countries and
                        everything else flows from that. You have a very powerful ambassador who can
                        get anywhere. And then you have what I take it to be other ambassadors, both
                        because of their governments and their abilities, who just don't have that
                        access. Did you almost find yourself having to act as a surrogate to the
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Surrogate to what, the foreign ambassador?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, to the Lebanese ambassador, the Jordanian
                        ambassador.</hi>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SEELYE: No, because Sisco was very good at seeing them. If they wanted to come in
                    to see him, he always made time available. He became very fond of the Lebanese
                    and Jordanian ambassadors. The Jordanian ambassador later became prime minister.
                    I think they both did well. I didn't sense any need to be a surrogate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view King Hussein at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: In those days, during the Nixon Administration, I think that may have
                    been the apogee of the relationship. There was a high regard for King Hussein.
                    During that time we had the Jordan crisis, which I can talk about if you would
                    like?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: That is the crisis in 1970 when the Palestinian-PLO guerrilla movement
                    had reached a point of becoming a state within a state in Jordan. The guerrillas
                    were setting up roadblocks and interfering with conduct of the affairs of
                    government. King Hussein was trying to react to this in a diplomatic fashion, by
                    negotiation, by talking, which is what everyone wants to do first. He tried to
                    persuade Arafat to cease and desist but was unsuccessful. Arafat was riding
                    high, the PLO was riding high and as we know from history, Arafat unfortunately
                    at times doesn't know when to change course when it would be in the interests of
                    the PLO to do so. So things were getting tenser and tenser in Jordan. There were
                    demonstrations and I remember at one point there were attacks on American
                    embassy property. Some of our cars in the motor pool were blown up. The embassy
                    was virtually under siege.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our Ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, at that point we had a Charg� and then Dean Brown went out. That
                    was the time that he had to present his credentials in a tank, it was so tense.
                    The Jordanian Ambassador came in quite often in those days. I remember taking
                    him up to Secretary Rogers and preparing a position paper for the Secretary
                    which was cleared through Sisco. As I recall, we suggested that Rogers tell the
                    Jordanian Ambassador that we appreciated everything that King Hussein had done
                    to try to work things out with the PLO, but from our standpoint the PLO had gone
                    too far. The U.S. stood by King Hussein but would have difficulty continuing to
                    stand by if he were increasingly weakened by the PLO. Wasn't it time to stand up
                    to the PLO?</p>
                <p>Well, that message was taken back and I don't know how much impact it had on the
                    King, probably marginal. But about that time King Hussein decided that he had to
                    confront the PLO.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His army...there were stories about women's underwear
                        being displayed on tank antenna as a sign of “we are being treated like
                        women.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: True. The Jordan army, which is essentially Bedouin and not Palestinian,
                    really wanted to move against the PLO. They were fed up with the way the King
                    was trying to accommodate the PLO. There were signs of their dissatisfaction.
                    The confrontation was a very bloody affair.</p>
                <p>The thing that complicated the whole affair was that just before the King decided
                    to confront the PLO a radical wing of the PLO, called the PFLP or Palestinian
                    Popular Liberation Front, hijacked four American planes and landed them at a
                    remote airstrip in the Jordan desert called Dawson's Landing. We had never heard
                    of this airstrip but obviously the PFLP had heard of it. It had been used in
                    World War II. These four planes suddenly flopped out of the air and landed in
                    the middle of the desert. The passengers were mostly American. They were being
                    held hostage by the PFLP in return for the release of Palestinians being held in
                    Israeli jails. Of course, the Israelis weren't going to respond to that.</p>
                <p>So it was a tense period. A task force was created which I headed where we tried
                    to figure out how to ease this crisis. One problem we had was to persuade our
                    allies—there were also some foreign nationals on the planes—not to give in to
                    any of the demands. I think in addition to the demands for the Palestinian
                    prisoners being held in Israel, the hijackers wanted Palestinians being held in
                    European jails also released. So we were trying to hold the line. We contacted
                    the International Red Cross because we wanted somebody to go and at least see
                    the passengers, to see that they were being taken care of, etc.</p>
                <p>It was about that time that the Jordanian Ambassador came in as I mentioned
                    earlier and when we thought it was time the Jordanians confronted the PLO. We
                    felt that if the Jordanian situation calmed down, then perhaps we could handle
                    the hijacking situation. They were really two separate developments. Suddenly
                    the passengers were taken off the planes and spread around the refugee camps of
                    Amman. I can't remember quite why they did that. This disturbed us even more
                    because we didn't know where they were and we were afraid that in the
                    confrontation that King Hussein had with the PLO Americans would get killed.
                    Well, there was some very, very bloody fighting. The Arab Legion was mad at
                    these Palestinians and really cut them to pieces and they won the battle. The
                    Palestinian guerrillas were forced to flee to the mountains.</p>
                <p>But that still left the problem of all these Americans. Believe it or not, as the
                    dust settled, every one of the fifty or so Americans, maybe more than a hundred,
                    being held emerged unscathed. We heard some remarkable stories. One of the
                    Americans told us that they ran short of food and their Palestinian hosts risked
                    their lives to go out during the fighting to get food for them. Some day I am
                    going back to the cables to review all this, but I can't remember the details
                    now.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>That was the beginning of the turn-around. At the same time you had in Jordan,
                    and had had there ever since the 1967 war, an Iraqi division, which just stayed
                    on. We were constantly worried that the Iraqis would come to the help of the
                    PLO. Fortunately they didn't. Then, the next thing we know we have reports of
                    Syrian tanks crossing the border from Syria into Jordan. The Syrians claimed
                    they were merely Palestinian tanks going to help the PLO, but they were Syrian
                    tanks, of course. At that point the White House got into the act.</p>
                <p>I remember one night coming back from the task force, about 9:30. At 9:45 there
                    was a call from Al Haig saying that Joe Sisco wanted me to come right down to
                    attend a meeting that Henry Kissinger, then NSC Advisor, was having. So I turned
                    around and went back. That night it so happened there was a black tie dinner at
                    the Airlie House attended by Melvin Laird, Kissinger and Sisco among others. So
                    on the way back apparently Kissinger had decided that they ought to have a WASAG
                    meeting (Washington Special Action Group) set up by Kissinger to handle
                    emergencies. Sisco apparently called Haig and said to get Seelye, I want to have
                    him with me when we talk about this.</p>
                <p>So we went into the WASAG meeting. What to do? The Syrians had invaded. King
                    Hussein, even though he had rolled back the PLO, was now threatened by an
                    invading force. Iraqi troops were there. What should be done? If my memory
                    serves me well, I remember Sisco turning to me and saying, “Well, obviously some
                    military intervention is needed. Is it better to be U.S. military or Israeli
                    military?” I said, off the top of my head, “The last thing we want is U.S.
                    military involvement.” I felt that once you had the U.S. military shedding Arab
                    blood then you risked repercussions that might affect on our embassies in the
                    Middle East. While Israel is considered an instrumentality of the United States,
                    I didn't think that an Israeli attack would cause as serious a reaction against
                    American institutions. I said to Sisco, “If somebody has to intervene—and I hope
                    that this will not be required—I would think it would be better to have the
                    Israelis do so.” And that was what Sisco announced to the group. Now I read in
                    other publications, like the book on Kissinger, that other people made that
                    decision. In any case, it was at that meeting that I strongly recommended to
                    Sisco against U.S. military intervention. Other people had argued in favor of
                    it, but the final decision was that if necessary the Israeli troops would be
                    deployed to do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Okay, so the next day this word is conveyed to the Israelis, be prepared to
                    intervene on behalf of King Hussein but by air to knock out the tanks, because
                    the Jordanian air force is very weak. The Israelis sent back word to us that
                    this operation could not be limited to an air operation, they would have to go
                    in by land as well. We didn't like that idea in Washington. We figured that that
                    would be the beginning of another Israeli occupation. So we said, “Well, in that
                    case we will have to think this proposition over for a couple of days.” Then two
                    things happened. One, King Hussein's air force was pretty effective in knocking
                    out a few Syrian tanks; secondly, Hafez al-Assad back in Syria, who was then
                    Chief of the Air Force, refused to give air cover to this column that had been
                    sent in by Saleh al-Jadid, the Prime Minister. The Syrian column started pulling
                    out. So Hafez al-Assad's action, together with the Jordanian air force action,
                    caused the withdrawal of the column just at the point we were holding back
                    authorizing the Israelis to move because they wanted to go in by land. So we
                    never had to use the Israelis. I have never heard that exact version in any book
                    I have read so far. But that is my own clear memory of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did Assad do what he did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, we now know that Assad and Jadid were at odds. There were two wings
                    of the Baath Party at that point, the ideologues and the relative pragmatists.
                    The ideologues had already begun to change the nature of Syrian society in
                    accordance with “Arab socialism.” Assad was more in favor of concentrating on
                    Arab unity. He didn't care much about ideology. And there was a rivalry for
                    leadership. Assad saw his action as a way of discrediting Jadid. And, indeed,
                    the withdrawal did discredit Jadid and was one of the spring boards that enabled
                    Assad to take over and become president of Syria shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>So the Israelis never had to move. But to this day I believe that if we had
                    authorized an Israeli ground intervention they would still be occupying the
                    Irbid Heights of Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the beginning of this crisis when we were telling
                        Hussein enough is enough you had better start doing something about this,
                        and then with the Americans being caught up in the whole thing, was this
                        operation, until it really started to blow up because of the Syrian threat
                        and all, being run pretty much from the State Department, or was the NSC in
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I didn't know then what the White House was doing because Kissinger was a
                    back channel man. We now know from this book by Isaacson that Kissinger used the
                    back channels in spades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This book you mention by Isaacson is called “Kissinger,”
                        and is very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SEELYE: So, I don't know what Kissinger was sending to our ambassadors. I only
                    know what we were sending and receiving.</p>
                <p>The most important point to be made is that Kissinger and Nixon portrayed the
                    crisis in terms of standing up to the Soviets and standing them down. The way
                    they had portrayed it is that the Soviets conspired in the Syrian invasion of
                    Jordan. The Soviets were strong supporters of the PLO but it is doubtful that
                    they had much to do with the PLO actions in Jordan or influenced the Syrians to
                    invade. But the Administration claimed that the Soviets had suffered a major
                    defeat. I remember that when the crisis was over journalists would pop into my
                    office and say, “We are told by the White House that the U.S. stood the Soviets
                    down.” “That's a lot of poppycock,” I said. “Our intelligence indicated that the
                    Soviets were urging the Syrians to exercise restraint and not to get involved in
                    this thing. They had no hand in the PLO buildup in Jordan or in the PLO
                    operation in Syria. Don't believe the White House.” Many years later, Kissinger
                    said to me (when I was in AF), “I remember you, you were always giving me a hard
                    time.” He must have referred to these conversations that I had with these
                    correspondents, which presumably got back to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that Kissinger had more or less
                        laid out most of the Soviet Union, China and all that as where he was going
                        to go; that he was leaving the Middle East because he was Jewish, more or
                        less in the hands of Rogers in the State Department, in the early
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, in the early years, but in this case I think he took a very active
                    interest in the Jordanian crisis. This time I think, despite all our efforts,
                    there was some movement of the Sixth Fleet and this sort of thing. I remember
                    when the Americans were being held on the planes, I said to Sisco, “We can't do
                    anything to provoke these guys. They will shoot our Americans.” And I think we
                    got the White House to hold off for a while but I think eventually they moved
                    the Sixth Fleet.</p>
                <p>So I think Kissinger did focus on it. I didn't deal with Kissinger. But I do know
                    that Kissinger had WASAG meetings and Alexis Johnson would go to those meetings
                    and once or twice I would be taken along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about where the Palestinians would end
                        up after this war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I have to say that there wasn't much sympathy for the Palestinian plight
                    in Jordan. I think we all felt that Arafat had exceeded the bounds of reasonable
                    behavior there and we were greatly concerned about the survivability of King
                    Hussein at that point. So we really weren't much concerned then about what would
                    happen to the PLO if they got cut to pieces. We felt, I think, that what it got
                    was what they deserved. Later on, a few months later, the Jordanians went in to
                    the mountains and cut them up some more. They had taken refuge in Ajlouri in the
                    mountains. That is when they fled through Syria and into Lebanon. It was the
                    Jordan crisis that led to the Lebanese crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, we are talking about 1968-72, was the
                        PLO causing problems in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Even before the PLO guerrillas got there, Palestinians caused problems. I
                    remember there was a famous Cairo agreement signed in 1969 between the Lebanese
                    and Palestinian organizations which, as I recall, allowed Palestinian guerrillas
                    to function in Lebanon to a limited extent. So the Lebanese were already having
                    problems with them. But when this whole big guerrilla force moved in from
                    Jordan, that really compounded the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at Lebanese affairs, was there concern that the
                        Maronites were having too much influence with our embassy? These were the
                        social people of the area. They also have whatever the lobby is in the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, the Maronites cultivated our embassy people. And I recall that our
                    ambassador there once made a request for modest funds to help finance a Maronite
                    publication. I recommended that we refuse this because I felt we would be drawn
                    into taking sides in Lebanese politics if we did so. I remember he came back
                    from Beirut, among other things, to plead the case. We had a meeting with Sisco
                    and he made a case of how we should help these people; it was just a modest
                    amount of money. Sisco turned to me and said, “Tal, I want you to give them the
                    money.” I went back and never did anything. Sisco never followed up on it. He
                    was doing that in front of our ambassador. Sisco had confidence in me, and he
                    supported my judgment. He just let the matter drop. And I let it drop. That is
                    what the White House staff used to do, whenever Nixon gave ridiculous orders.
                    Half the time they would ignore them. Our ambassador was a good man, but he was
                    not an experienced Middle East hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Dwight Porter. He had no background in the Middle East. I don't think he
                    had sensitivity about the dangers of getting pulled into the Maronite orbit.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we able to get any feel in Lebanon at that time of
                        what was going on in the Muslim community, which later became sort of the
                        root cause...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the root cause was the Shiite Muslims. At that time I don't think
                    we really had enough of a sense of the potential problems that could be
                    generated from that community. We knew that most of the Shiites lived in the
                    south and that the south was not as well off as the rest of Lebanon. Like any
                    central government southern regions tend to be ignored. At that point there was
                    no suggestion that the Shiites were a political problem. The Speaker of the
                    House, according to the original covenant that set up Lebanon, was a Shiite. But
                    in those days the Shiites were a small minority in the government. It has been
                    the population explosion that has made them into the largest single group
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Syria? Syria always seems to be the odd man out
                        in the Middle East from our policy point of view. Here it is, it has a lot
                        of potential but doesn't seem to be able to have the impact as some of the
                        others do, Egypt or Iraq. Impact on U.S. and also in the area. What were our
                        interests in Syria and how do we view Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: At that time, of course, we had no diplomatic relations with Syria. Our
                    main operational concerns were our Interests Section in Damascus. Maintaining it
                    and making sure money got to the Italians who had taken it over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have officers there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, no. No officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't like we did in Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, neither Iraqi nor Syrian Interest Sections had any officers.</p>
                <p>At that point (Assad took over in 1970) Syria was considered a radical regime.
                    Until Assad took over Syria hadn't played much of a role or attempted to play
                    much of a role in regional political dynamics.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>As regard to Lebanon, Syria's presence was nowhere near what it has been since
                    then, since 1976. Syria always felt that Lebanon was geographically part of
                    Syria. Relations were reasonably good, but Lebanese governments who made
                    decisions in those days did not have to defer to Syria as they do now. So
                    Syria's role in Lebanon was modest until 1976. There were a lot of Syrian
                    workers working there. I don't recall during this period, even when there were
                    crises in Lebanon, Syria had much of a role to play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we at that time view the influence of the Soviet
                        Union in the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, of course, old hands, like me, always took a jaundiced view of the
                    propensity of Washington, even before Kissinger came along, to view Middle East
                    problems in cold war terms. And of course Kissinger developed that to an nth
                    degree. Before he came along we had the Baghdad Pact which was an effort to
                    build up a buffer against Soviet influence. Instead it helped to inspire
                    nationalists like Nasser to come along. Then we had the Middle East Defense
                    Organization, which involved handing out money to Arab governments to build up
                    their so-called anti-communist military defenses. None of us, or very few of us,
                    really believed in this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, in the late fifties, countries like Syria began to move more
                    into the Soviet orbit as a reaction to our strong support to Israel and because
                    of actions Israel was taking. Our refusal to help Syria, ourselves, militarily
                    turned them to the Soviets for military aid. It was as simple as that. There was
                    a radical regime in Syria before the Baath took over. But when the Baath took
                    over there was a propensity in some parts of Washington to say that Syria was
                    pro-Soviet. The Middle East hands knew that the Baathists were anti-communist,
                    anti-Marxist. I never believed that a Baath regime was going to hand over Syria
                    to the Soviets. And, of course, they didn't. When Assad came in he kept the
                    Soviets at arms length. So anybody who understood Syria in those days knew that
                    the Soviets had very minimal influence in Syria. They provided military
                    assistance, yes. And in that sense some people were concerned because on paper
                    the large quantity of Syrian arms made Syria look as if it was a match for the
                    Israeli army. But anybody who knew the Syrian army as I did, knew that was a lot
                    of malarkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you know the Syrian army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: All you had to do was to drive between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon in the
                    early fifties and see what a crummy bunch the Syrian military were. We could
                    also tell that the quality of leadership was limited and they weren't very good
                    at maintaining their equipment, etc. So the Syrian military threat was always a
                    myth in the view of people like me, at least. And, of course, when Kissinger
                    came along he tried to propagate this view.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I don't recall that we were ever called upon to try to bring people into
                    the Service who might specialize in Arab affairs. I sensed, however, that for a
                    period of time fewer Foreign Service officers chose to take Arab studies. That
                    was the case, I think. I think the closing of the posts may have affected the
                    disposition of many Foreign Service officers to make this a specialty. I think
                    that is true. And I sensed a hiatus as time went on with regard to officers with
                    experience in the Middle East.</p>

                <p>SEELYE: There was an amusing vignette that happened during the Jordan crisis. One
                    night, about 10:00, up on the seventh floor, Secretary Rogers came in in black
                    tie as he had just been to a dinner party. He wanted to hear about the four
                    airplanes that had just been hijacked with American passengers and had landed in
                    the Jordanian desert. He had heard that a number of the passengers were from New
                    York state and he asked me what towns they were from. I said that they were from
                    Syracuse, Albany and places like that. He said, “Oh, I thought maybe they were
                    from cow country.” I pricked up my ears and said, “Cow country? What cow country
                    did you mean?” And he said, “Well, a county that we call cow country up in New
                    York state. You wouldn't have heard of it.” I said, “Well, are you talking about
                    St. Lawrence County?” He said, “Yes,” and looked up in surprise. It is a county
                    up near the Canadian border. I said, “Do you come from there?” And he said,
                    “Yes, I come from there.” And I said, “What town do you come from?” And he said,
                    “A small town you never would have heard of.” I said, “Canton, New York?” He
                    said, “Yes.” I had gone to high school there. I lived there for five years, and
                    it turned out he played basketball for the same coach that I had ten years
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment was what everybody comes into the
                        Foreign Service and prepares for, to be ambassador. How did this come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: While I was at that job, during the early part of the Jordan crisis and
                    before the 1970 confrontation with the PLO, Harry Symmes was pulled out of Amman
                    as our Ambassador. I am afraid he had been requested to leave by the Jordanians.
                    There was a hiatus and somebody came to me and asked if I would like to be
                    considered for ambassador to Jordan. I said no. I had just been on the desk a
                    relatively short time and just didn't feel, for various reasons, that I wanted
                    the job. That must have been some time in 1969. Then in 1971, Sisco called me in
                    and said, “How would you like to be ambassador to Kuwait?” I said, “Sure.” In
                    fact, I remember going on vacation and getting material on Kuwait. I got back
                    and he said, “Forget it, Bill Stoltzfus is going there.” Apparently Vice
                    President Agnew had been out to Saudi Arabia and liked Stoltzfus and wanted to
                    give him the job in Kuwait. I said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>It is funny how these things happen. You would think the Foreign Service would
                    have had a more organized, structured way to appoint Ambassadors. Later I was
                    taking a carpool with someone who was in African affairs. In those days North
                    Africa was part of African Affairs. He said to me, “Did you know that Arch
                    Calhoun has just been withdrawn as ambassador to Tunisia. So Tunisia is coming
                    open.” So one day I was in Sisco's office on something else and I said, “By the
                    way Joe, I have been here four years and maybe it is time to go somewhere else.
                    I understand Tunisia is open.” He said, “Really? Would you like to go?” I said,
                    “Yep.” So I guess Sisco goes to the Secretary and puts my name into the State
                    Department hopper and I was just lucky to be the one selected. But isn't it
                    funny how those things happen? Not that my hearing of it meant I would get it,
                    but at least it got my name into the hopper.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Tunisia from 1972-76. What was the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Let me tell you the story of my arrival. As you know Tunisia is
                    bilingual—French and Arabic—and before I left I was told I would be received at
                    the airport and would be expected to make some remarks upon my arrival. So I
                    asked colleagues in North African Affairs whether I should do it in French or
                    Arabic. Some said French and some said Arabic. So I decided to do it my way. I
                    prepared my remarks and had them written out. I arrived and started out in
                    French for the first half, and in the middle I switched to Arabic. It was like
                    the difference between night and day. People who were looking bored suddenly
                    perked up when I started Arabic. The chief of protocol almost jumped out of his
                    seat. The correspondents came up to me afterwards. And that was the reason I had
                    done it that way. I felt this switch from French to Arabic would cause
                    attention. And from then on I noticed when I traveled around Tunisia people
                    would comment that they had seen me speaking Arabic on TV. So it turned out to
                    be a good thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that Tunisia was not a post where we sent people
                        who spoke Arabic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I was the first Ambassador to do so. This was unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that as a practical thing Arabic was really
                        what was spoken further down the line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No it was a break for me, essentially. I had never used French in the
                    Foreign Service, although I had studied French and took a little Berlitz under
                    the GI Bill while waiting to enter the Foreign Service. So I saw this as an
                    opportunity to improve my French and keep up my Arabic. I used my French
                    essentially with the Tunisians, although not always, because Tunisian Arabic is
                    quite different from the standard Arabic. So when I spoke to a gardener I had to
                    speak in French. But an educated Tunisian could understand standard Arabic, of
                    course. So I used both, actually. I think it was good to have an Arabist there
                    because it is an Arab country, a member of the Arab League. They were pleased to
                    have somebody who speaks Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I was told before I arrived that President Bourguiba had six months
                    to live, a year at the most. He is still alive at the age of 90 something. He
                    was already getting somewhat senile and had had some illnesses. The result was
                    he was under medication, under doctor's care. They would sort of pump him up in
                    the morning and he would be alert and dynamic and his charismatic self, and in
                    the afternoon he would kind of sleep off the drugs. So he was fading but was
                    still a powerful president. I found him to be the most charismatic head of an
                    Arab state that I ever met and I have met Faisal, Assad and Hussein, all very
                    powerful in their way, but he was charismatically powerful in his personality.
                    He had sparkling blue eyes and his chin would stick out when he addressed you.
                    And he was very well disposed toward the United States. He considered France and
                    the United States his two best “friends” without exception. His American
                    connection started really with a Foreign Service officer. You probably have
                    heard the story many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hooker Doolittle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. Hooker Doolittle was our consul in Tunis in the early forties. When
                    the Germans invaded North Africa in 1942, Tunisia became a German protectorate.
                    I am not sure whether Hooker Doolittle was there during the occupation, but he
                    certainly was there when the Germans withdrew in 1943 after we defeated the
                    Germans. Habib Bourguiba, who had been arrested by the French in the thirties
                    for his activities as a Tunisian nationalist, had been incarcerated in France.
                    When the Germans defeated France in 1940 they only occupied Paris and a portion
                    of France. When we invaded North Africa, they occupied the rest of France, which
                    meant they occupied the town in which Bourguiba was incarcerated. They released
                    him from prison and told him they wanted him to support them there. Bourguiba
                    said he would not do that, but they left him alone and he went back to Tunisia.
                    Somehow Doolittle got to know him and realized that while Bourguiba was a
                    nationalist, he was a Francophile. He was not opposed to French influence or
                    contacts. So when the French came back in, after the Allied victory, the French
                    Resident General heard about this American consul who was interfering in
                    internal affairs of French-Tunisian activities. One day Doolittle went to the
                    French authorities because at that point Bourguiba had gone into hiding because
                    the French wanted to rearrest him. Doolittle told the French authorities that
                    this was a good man who was friendly to France. He just wanted an independent
                    country. Doolittle recommended that Bourguiba be left alone. Finally, Bourguiba
                    managed to escape at which point the French were quite upset and complained to
                    Eisenhower about the American consul who was interfering in their affairs.
                    Eisenhower got Doolittle transferred to Alexandria as vice consul to stamp visas
                    at our consulate there. And ironically three or four years later, he was still
                    there when Bourguiba applied for a visa to go to the United States to work for
                    independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Well, Bourguiba recalled Doolittle with such warmth that almost every time I
                    called upon him, the first thing he would talk about was Hooker Doolittle. And
                    indeed, after independence, one of the first things he did was to invite Hooker
                    Doolittle back, then retired from the Foreign Service, and gave him the red
                    carpet treatment. So it was Doolittle who started the American connection, and
                    then, of course in the mid fifties we were a strong supporter of Tunisian
                    independence, and that reinforced it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand there is a Hooker Doolittle Street
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, I think there is. He was related to the famous General Jimmy
                    Doolittle.</p>
                <p>So it is nice to know that your country was held in high esteem and that helped
                    me a lot there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The first interest was the opportunity for Tunisia to serve as a model
                    third world country as a recipient of economic aid. Our AID program, of course,
                    was developing. We thought that because of the enlightened nature of its society
                    and leadership, plus a capable working class, we could make Tunisia a model for
                    AID success. So we went in there with a substantial AID program and worked hard
                    at that. That was number one.</p>
                <p>Number two, as the Soviet fleet began to operate in the Mediterranean and flex
                    its muscles, Tunisia became more important to us strategically—located athwart
                    the narrow Straits of Sicily. Therefore in a cold war context it had that kind
                    of importance.</p>
                <p>Then, I think in terms of Arab politics we saw Tunisia as a very moderate
                    country. Bourguiba was a very moderate leader. And he had the guts to stand up
                    and say what he thought. In 1967 he visited the West Bank, which was then part
                    of Jordan, where he went to a Palestinian refugee camp. Here he announced that
                    it was time for the Arabs to make peace with Israel. At which point Tunisia was
                    kicked out of the Arab League for a while. But Bourguiba at the same time was a
                    strong believer in a Palestinian state—in Palestinians having their own country.
                    So he was a moderate force in the Arab world and the Tunisians were important in
                    that sense.</p>
                <p>I guess those were the three important reasons.</p>
                <p>Also, with Qadhafi of Libya next door it was important that there be a moderate
                    counterweight in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your contacts with Bourguiba, his son was foreign
                        minister wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Not while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything implicit or explicit about if Qadhafi
                        and Libya start messing around in your country we will give whatever support
                        we can?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, that developed later. That developed in the 1980s when Qadhafi was
                    flexing his muscles—and before the Israelis bombed the PLO headquarters—we had
                    assured Tunisia that we would provide support if Tunisia were threatened.
                    However, we hadn't expected the enemy to be Israel, of course. Bourguiba always
                    kept his military very small. He wanted to keep the military out of politics. So
                    he did rely on the Sixth Fleet umbrella. We had Sixth Fleet visits every now and
                    then to reassure him. He once told me in the presence of the Sixth Fleet
                    Commander that he considered the Sixth Fleet his “bouclic,” his shield. But in
                    my time there was no undertaking to defend Tunisia against Qadhafi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the French during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Their relationship was similar to ours. Bourguiba thought very highly of
                    the French. The French Ambassador and I were the two ambassadors he would rely
                    on. Once his prime minister was away from the country and he had a foreign
                    minister by the name of Mohammed Masmoudi, who had been in cahoots with Qadhafi.
                    I think Qadhafi was paying him off. Masmoudi kind of liked to cultivate the
                    radical elements. I knew what Masmoudi was like and I tried to develop a good
                    relationship with him. I knew he liked Cuban cigars, so I always brought one to
                    him. One day, he persuaded the President to go down to Jerba, which is an island
                    off Tunisia adjacent to the Libyan border, to meet with Qadhafi. The meeting was
                    on TV. It was Sunday and we all watched and were surprised to see as the meeting
                    went on that there was talk about unity between Tunisia and Libya. There had
                    been no advance notice of anything like this. The next thing we knew there was
                    Bourguiba being led in kind of a fog to a table and given a pen and he signed a
                    unity document. It was announced that Tunisia and Libya had united. It shocked
                    everybody else in Tunisia. Bourguiba flew back to Tunis that night and word of
                    the unity declaration got back to the Prime Minister, who was in Paris. He
                    immediately flew back to Tunisia and called me that night. The British and
                    Italian Ambassadors wanted to see me. They arrived quite upset wondering what
                    was going to happen. I said, “Don't worry, Bourguiba was in a funk when he
                    signed the document and it won't last more than a couple of days.” They said
                    they were worried. Late that night I got a call from the Prime Minister who said
                    that I had an appointment with the President the next day at 9:00. He didn't say
                    why. So I put two and two together and assumed that he wanted me to discourage
                    the President from going through with this.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Well, I decided I wasn't going to tell him what to do. I was just going to ask
                    him a lot of leading questions. Where was the capital going to be? How did this
                    affect the U.S. relationship? So I spent my one half hour with the President
                    just asking questions and raising issues, etc. and left it at that. Much to my
                    surprise, in behind me came the French Ambassador. Obviously, the Prime Minister
                    had called him too. I guess the French Ambassador provably more or less raised
                    some of the same questions.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Prime Minister obviously was working hard to turn the thing around
                    and was pointing out the pitfalls and stupidity of the thing. Sure enough within
                    two or three days the announcement was made that unity had been canceled. The
                    whole thing was finis. And it was reflective of Bourguiba's just being at a low
                    point and Masmoudi's being able to lead him down the garden path. Well, after
                    that the son of Bourguiba (Bibi) was particularly upset with Masmoudi. One day
                    he came to me and said, “The Prime Minister and I have been talking, we would
                    like you to go and see the President and get him to dump Masmoudi.” I said, “I
                    can't do that. This is none of my business.” I didn't even cable Washington for
                    instructions. I found that as Ambassador you do what you think is right. I said,
                    “Look, the U.S. can't get involved. Firstly, I can't go to the President, and
                    secondly, how can I have more influence than you, his son, and the Prime
                    Minister who is his designate? I just don't understand it.” I still don't
                    understand it to this day. And he went away unhappy. Masmoudi stayed on quite a
                    while. I can't remember how they finally got rid of him. But to this day I am
                    amazed that the son of the President would come to me on this. But again that
                    showed the President attached a lot of importance to what the American
                    representative would say to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and the French Ambassador kind of compare notes
                        from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes. There was a great French Ambassador. Normally, as you know, the
                    French try to undercut our interests. Often French ambassadors are undercutting
                    us, and when I went to Damascus, that is later on, Dick Murphy said, “Watch out
                    for the French Ambassador.” But in Tunisia, he was very responsive. He happened
                    to be a Protestant from Lyon, a very cultivated man, very cosmopolitan, very
                    friendly to me. We used to compare notes all the time. In fact, he was one of
                    the few people who understood and appreciated the modern art which my wife had
                    borrowed for our embassy. His successor was a little different so I didn't have
                    the same relationship. But we were together about two years, this French
                    Ambassador and I.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>One thing did happen which was amusing concerning the French. Just after my
                    French friend left, Giscard d'Estaing came to Tunisia. He was President at that
                    time. Everyday I used to look at both the French and Arabic newspapers. I would
                    at least scan the headlines. When the Arabic newspaper came the day that Giscard
                    arrived there was a picture of me on the front page. I wondered what I was doing
                    on the front page. I looked under the picture and it said, “Giscard d'Estaing.”
                    If it had been my old friend, I would have called the French Ambassador and
                    joked with him about it, but the new French Ambassador was a little bit stiff
                    and I didn't know him. They had just put my picture in by mistake. I still have
                    it as a memento, but you had to understand Arabic to understand the amusing
                    aspect of it. I wonder to this day if the French knew about it because their
                    officials didn't read Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impact of the 1973 war? This is the one where
                        Egypt made a surprise attack on Israel (Yom Kippur War) and did well in the
                        beginning but it all fell apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the first evening of the war Bourguiba got on the radio and TV and
                    said, “We have a Jewish community here in Tunisia which is loyal, it has been
                    here for centuries. They are indigenous and part of our society. I will not
                    allow anybody to hurt a hair on their heads. They are loyal Tunisians.” He said
                    that immediately so there would not be any outbreaks against the Tunisian Jewish
                    community. And there weren't.</p>
                <p>There was a coolness for a while against the United States because of our support
                    for Israel and the fact that Egypt was getting defeated near the end. But it was
                    never reflected in any overt action and it soon dissipated. I don't recall being
                    called in by the Foreign Minister or Prime Minister to complain. Maybe they did,
                    but I just don't recall it. Just sort of a coolness for a while. We had a lot of
                    Tunisian friends, but for a few months they thought it was unwise to invite any
                    Americans to their parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Tunisians view Egypt? You had a new man in
                        power, Sadat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, Tunisia had good relations with Egypt. They also had a common
                    interest in opposing Qadhafi because Qadhafi was causing problems for both the
                    Tunisian government and the Egyptian government. At one point Qadhafi sent
                    across some agents to Gafsa in southern Tunisia and they tried to cause a
                    demonstration and start some kind of uprising. But they failed. And, of course,
                    Qadhafi was trying to do the same thing in Egypt. So the two nations had a
                    common interest in opposing Qadhafi. As I recall, they got along pretty well,
                    the Egyptians and the Tunisians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern at that time about what is now
                        called Islamic Fundamentalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SEELYE: No. In those days they pretty much didn't exist. Bourguiba, of course,
                    was a secularist and one of the platforms of “Bourgabisme,” as they called it,
                    was to secularize as much as possible while being good Moslems. In fact,
                    Bourguiba went so far one time during Ramadan—as you know during Ramadan you
                    cannot eat or drink—of appearing on television during the day with a glass of
                    water in front of him. He sipped the water while telling Tunisians you could be
                    good Moslems and still drink water and eat food during Ramadan. He said you
                    should do that because otherwise you lose productivity, and productivity is
                    important to society's well being. Well, just about everything else Bourguiba
                    had done to reform the country had worked, but this didn't work. That was too
                    much. People would not accept that. But I didn't sense during my time that there
                    was any active fundamentalist movement in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in trying to promote American
                        commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: To a very limited extent, because it was such a French market. There were
                    very few American firms who showed any interest in Tunisia. The traditional
                    problem with American firms, at least in the past, was that they didn't have the
                    patience to spend enough time building the building blocks required for a market
                    for their products. I found that all over the Middle East. They would go for a
                    few days or a week and then leave, whereas the Japanese and the French would
                    spend weeks and months cultivating people, getting a feel of the lay of the land
                    and understanding the local mentality.</p>
                <p>Also Tunisia was a French-speaking country and few American businessmen spoke
                    French. So there was very little American interest in trade. I remember somebody
                    coming through who wanted to involve his firm in agribusiness in Tunisia, and we
                    encouraged the Tunisians to take a good look at this. But unfortunately in those
                    days there was still an aftermath of the French colonial presence. In 1961, four
                    years after independence, the French farmers were kicked out and all their lands
                    were nationalized. Therefore, when somebody like an American agribusiness person
                    came along and wanted to lease land for a particular period of time, the
                    Tunisians turned him down because this had echoes of foreigners running the
                    land. That would have been a good business opportunity for an American firm.
                    Since then, the Tunisians have waived their requirement.</p>
                <p>There was one company there that imported American used clothes in tremendous
                    quantities. These American used clothes shipped abroad are often in very good
                    shape. Otherwise there was minimal American commercial interest in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Algeria? Algeria had been independent for some
                        time but was going economically down the tubes. Was Bourguiba and the group
                        around him pointing to Algeria and saying, “Here it is not working?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, Tunisia wanted to maintain good relations with Algeria. During the
                    Algerian revolution the Tunisians gave asylum to Algerians and Algerian
                    guerrillas in Tunisia. They felt a strong identify with Algeria. But there was
                    no way they wanted to copy Algeria economically because Algeria had become very
                    socialist in its economy. Tunisia had its experience with socialism between
                    1967-69, when they had a man by the name of Ahmed Ben Saleh, a very bright,
                    active minister of agriculture, who at one point had six portfolios, and decided
                    to nationalize everything. Maybe it was partly the vibes from Algeria that
                    carried over and Bourguiba went along with it. He went so far as to nationalize
                    retail outfits. But the government had its comeuppance because when it tried to
                    nationalize the olive groves along the coast in the south, which had been in
                    private hands for ages, the farmers resisted. Some people were killed and
                    suddenly these things changed. Bourguiba decided they weren't going to
                    nationalize anymore. He kicked out Ben Saleh, arrested him. The whole focus of
                    economic development shifted back to privatization. So from 1969 on, the whole
                    emphasis was on privatizing and has been ever since. So Tunisia experimented
                    with socialism and decided it didn't like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Tunisia and the UN? Did you find yourself going
                        up, as every ambassador does?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Oh, yes, those usual circular telegrams. Tunisia was pretty good at the
                    UN, they were helpful to us. We never had any problems with them at the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever called up while you were there to use
                        Tunisia as sort of a cat's paw on some Arab problem we were having?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: One of the things that happened there during my early days was the sad
                    occurrence in the Sudan, Khartoum, when Cleo Noel and Curt Moore were
                    assassinated. Shortly thereafter, I don't know if it was a day or two after, my
                    station chief came to me and said that he had a report that these assassins or
                    their accomplices were coming to Tunisia. Now we know in retrospect that those
                    people were held in arrest, so it must have been their associates. There was
                    concern about their intentions. So I cabled Washington and told them I just
                    wanted to make sure they had this information. I indicated that we had two
                    choices. I could share this information with the Tunisians so they could
                    intercept them. On the other hand, I had been told by my station chief that if
                    we informed the Tunisians, we would compromise a very sensitive source. I asked
                    Washington what it wanted me to do? I got a midnight call from Washington saying
                    to tell the Tunisians and to get a bodyguard. So I told the Tunisians and
                    temporarily had a Marine bodyguard. The Tunisians were concerned about this
                    report and supposedly they intercepted them, I don't know, and then assigned me
                    a bodyguard from the Presidential Palace. That person became my bodyguard from
                    then on, all because of the Khartoum business. You know once these arrangements
                    start, you can never end them.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Now in connection with that whole affair, I remember after it happened I got
                    instructions from Washington to go in and strongly complain to the Tunisians
                    about this terrible thing that had happened in the Sudan and that we expected
                    all friendly governments to publicly denounce it. So I went in to see Bourguiba
                    on this and he unfortunately kind of passed it off. He didn't respond the way
                    Washington had hoped he would respond. Washington was furious that Bourguiba had
                    not out of hand said, “This is outrageous and despicable, I will condemn it and
                    will go on TV tomorrow.” A rocket came back from Washington instructing me to go
                    back and tell the guy that he had to say something. Instead, I went to his chef
                    de cabinet, a very nice and cooperative individual. I went to his home. I said,
                    “I have a problem here. Washington is very upset that the President is not
                    taking a stronger position about this. We are very upset about this. These are
                    two very good friends of mine. It is a shocking incident. I am upset. Isn't
                    there something that you people can do to be a little more responsive on this?”
                    He said, “I understand.” So he gave me a response which was just what I needed.
                    I forget whether he used Bourguiba's name or not. Anyway he got me off the
                    hook.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, there is a dramatic event that happened there. In March, 1973, there
                    were terrible floods in the Majerda Valley, north of Tunis. It had rained for
                    many, many days and waters were rising and suddenly the dam at the head of the
                    valley burst and the waters surged higher. The Prime Minister called me in at
                    4:00 that afternoon and said, “Please come to my office in a hurry.” When I got
                    there he said, “We have a critical situation developing. Our farmers literally
                    have sought refuge on housetops as the waters are rising. We are afraid they are
                    going to be washed away. We have to do something about it. What can you do about
                    it?” I said, “Well, we have helicopters in the Sixth Fleet.” “Oh,” he said,
                    “Can't you bring them here by nightfall?” I said, “Look, nightfall is only an
                    hour and a half away. That would be a miracle. But I will try to get help by the
                    first thing in the morning.” So I went back and used a radio telephone to reach
                    the Sixth Fleet Commander. Miraculously I got him. “Well,” he said, “my main
                    aircraft carrier with helicopters has gone off to Vietnam. I have another one
                    headed north towards Sardinia that has a few helicopters on it which I will turn
                    around forthwith and point it towards Tunisia. I will try to have the
                    helicopters there by dawn.”</p>
                <p>I didn't check with Washington beforehand. I probably cabled Washington at that
                    point telling them what I was doing, I don't recall. I must have.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I then called the Prime Minister to tell him what I was doing. I said, “Would you
                    like to go with me on the lead helicopter?” He said, “No, but I will assign one
                    of my ministers.” So he was at the airport with me first thing in the morning.
                    The first two helicopters arrived and the plan was that we would go on a
                    reconnaissance mission to see what the extent of the need was. Meanwhile we had
                    a Tunisian non-com assigned to each helicopter who spoke Arabic for
                    communication with those being rescued. We started off and hadn't gone but a few
                    miles when we saw two people waving from a rooftop, with the water really way up
                    there. So the other helicopter, as if this had been an exercise planned for
                    ages, lowered a rope with a swing. The helicopter pulled up one guy and then
                    pulled up the other guy. The Minister was looking out the window watching this
                    and said, “Fantastique! Extraordinaire!” As if it had all been planned.</p>
                <p>We realized that our helicopter would also have to go on a rescue mission. So we
                    started to look for people to rescue. As we hovered over rooftops, we had a
                    difficult time convincing people they would be safe being pulled up into the
                    helicopters. They were scared. So instead of lowering the swing, we would lower
                    a sort of a platform and this way we could bring up whole families. They were
                    just scared to death with us hovering over them and the water just pouring
                    around. The currents were heavy. Finally, we got about 40 people crammed into
                    the helicopter, sitting in the aisles. We took them to high land. We did that
                    two or three times. Then we returned.</p>
                <p>Finally, helicopters arrived from Italy, France and Libya. But we were the first
                    off. The minister was very appreciative. The Prime Minister called me up and
                    said, “This is terrific.” The helicopter pilot said to me, “This is the best
                    thing we have done in the last year. Most of the time we just pick up our pilots
                    out of the ocean. Here we are doing something useful.”</p>
                <p>So that is an example of the kind of thing we could do for Tunisia and they
                    appreciated it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing from 1976-78?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I was called back to Washington. I was told in October, 1975 by Roy
                    Atherton who was then visiting Tunisia that I could expect to extend to three
                    years. So I was patting myself on my back thinking I had another year in this
                    lovely country. Suddenly, out of the blue—in fact we were planning to go to
                    England to put my daughter in school—I got a call in early December from William
                    Schaufele saying, “I want you to come back and be my deputy.” I said, “Deputy
                    for what?” He said, “For African Affairs.” I said, “I know about North African
                    affairs but nothing about the rest of the continent.” Well, he still wanted me.
                    I said, “Let me check into this.” So I called Atherton, who was Assistant
                    Secretary of NEA, and said, “Roy, I got a call from Bill Schaufele and he says I
                    should come back as his deputy. You told me in October that I would be staying.
                    What is the story?” Roy is often a man of few words. All he said was, “The
                    Secretary likes you.” That was Henry Kissinger. I said, “What do you mean?” He
                    said, “The Secretary likes you. He wants you to come back and take that job.”
                    So, I had no choice. There it was. So I called Bill Schaufele back and said,
                    “Well, Bill, tell me more about this.” He said, “I would like you to start as
                    soon as possible.” I said, “Well, I'm coming home on home leave in two weeks and
                    we can talk about it.” I came home on home leave and we talked. He said that he
                    wanted me to manage AF. He wanted me right away. I said, “Well, I need 2-3
                    months to finish things off. The Vice President is coming on a visit in March.
                    How about my staying until the end of March?” “Okay,” he said. So at the end of
                    March I came back to become Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary at AF.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will close now and next time let's start with the Vice
                        President's visit to Tunisia and then your return to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 24, 1994. Talcott, we want to talk about
                        Nelson Rockefeller's visit as Vice President before we move on to your going
                        into AF.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, Nelson Rockefeller's visit to Tunisia was not terribly significant.
                    The reason he visited Tunisia was on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of
                    Tunisia's independence. I had urged that the Administration send a senior
                    official. I couldn't have been happier that they sent the second ranking
                    American official to attend the affair. Of course, Rockefeller was a consummate
                    politician, and excellent glad-handler and he fit in and mixed very well. All
                    major countries were represented. Not all at such a high rank. I recall at the
                    large reception held for all the visitors Rockefeller was kind of the focal
                    point. And of course he handled his contacts in inimitable style. My wife
                    escorted Happy, Rockefeller's wife, as she was also there. I don't recall
                    anything very significant happening. We took them on a visit to Carthage. He
                    wasn't there more than about 48 hours at the most. So it was really a quick
                    visit. But I think, if I recall correctly, he also had a separate meeting with
                    Bourguiba. I don't recall that meeting. But Bourguiba, who always attached a lot
                    of importance to the U.S. relationship, was pleased that Rockefeller
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>From our new residence in Sidi Bou Said I pointed out to Rockefeller the view of
                    the bay. This residence was designed by a Tunisian architect and had been
                    improved upon considerably by my wife as it went up. When we arrived in Tunisia
                    they were just digging the foundation. So for a year and a half we lived in the
                    former Ambassador's residence in Carthage and moved to the new residence half
                    way through our tour. But in the year and a half while it was going up there was
                    a very unimaginative FBO architect who was assigned to oversee the operation. My
                    wife, who has the skills of an interior decorator, added a lot of touches to the
                    original design which I think added a good deal to the villa. It had a
                    magnificent location overlooking the Bay of Tunis. I took Rockefeller and his
                    wife out on the terrace and we could see the small Tunisian navy that had been
                    deployed in front of the President's Palace, which was below us.</p>
                <p>The original property for the Ambassador's residence had been given us by
                    President Bourguiba, for which we were immensely appreciative because it was
                    really a unique location. After it was completed the Fourth of July was coming
                    up so we had the annual reception planned to be held there. I thought it would
                    be nice for Bourguiba to see the new residence on that occasion. Word came back
                    that the President could not establish a precedence by attending our national
                    day because he would have to attend others. But he would come up separately on a
                    separate day and accept our invitation to look at the residence.</p>
                <p>Suddenly one day about noon I got a call from the Palace saying the President
                    would be there at 3:00 that afternoon. I called my wife and we received him.
                    Again the terrace was the focal point. It was such a magnificent view looking
                    across the Bay of Tunis. At that point we had only just planted vegetation. At
                    one point the President was standing on the terrace looking at the view with his
                    aide, a man by the name Alouati. I overheard in Arabic the aide saying to the
                    President, “Yes, Mr. President, they can see the Palace from here.” This was
                    true. At that point we could see the tip of the pier in front of the Palace and
                    a little bit of the Palace itself. But of course as the trees grew up one could
                    no longer see the Palace. But I thought that was a kind of cute little comment.
                    In any case, the President came and it was a nice half hour visit.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you came back to Washington from 1976-78. Your
                        position was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I think I told you the circumstances of my return in the last interview.
                    I was to return to Washington and become Bill Schaufele's deputy in the African
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I came back in March, 1976. It was not very convenient for my youngest
                    daughter because we had to take her out of school in the middle of the year. And
                    we had to, of course, kick out our tenants who were with the British embassy. I
                    settled into the Bureau of African Affairs and began to learn what my
                    responsibilities were and to learn about Africa. I was a little bit concerned
                    because I came in with a very limited knowledge about Africa. What happened was
                    that I took the place of Ed Mulcahy who was then assigned to take my place in
                    Tunisia, which was very fortunate for him because he had served there as DCM
                    some years before. So he had the pleasure of serving there twice.</p>
                <p>In the course of the next several months, and, in fact, throughout my tour of a
                    year and a half in AF, Bill Schaufele, Assistant Secretary, was frequently in
                    Africa on trips because at this point we were getting very involved in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 1976-78 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, this is March, 1976.</p>
                <p>Bill Schaufele would be absent quite frequently so I would often be acting
                    assistant secretary. Early on the Secretary, Henry Kissinger, was planning a
                    trip to Africa. He sort of discovered Africa. Generally speaking Kissinger had
                    very little interest in the third world and what interest he had was keyed to
                    the cold war implications of Third World activities. He never looked at the
                    Third World in terms of the inherent problems, but thought that the problems
                    flowed from the East-West rivalry. What awakened his interest in Africa was the
                    Angola business when the Cuban troops were sent there. He decided that because
                    the Cubans were in league with the Soviets that therefore the Soviets were
                    beginning to penetrate southern Africa—this, of course, includes South Africa.
                    Henry Kissinger had a great fondness for South Africa. So he decided that he
                    should give a little more attention to the southern Africa region which included
                    Rhodesia, which was in a state of flux. There were several movements in Rhodesia
                    which were seeking to establish themselves as a follow-on government to the
                    white Rhodesian government. You also had a problem in Namibia, where there was
                    South African involvement. And so forth. So it was the Secretary's decision that
                    he should spend more time on Africa and he decided to make a trip.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>He used to call me up and talk about the trip. I think the first time he called
                    me up to his office was when I was acting assistant secretary in April some
                    time. I said to him, “Mr. Secretary, I am still finding my way around Africa.”
                    He said, “That's all right. I remember you when I was in the White House.” I
                    didn't know quite what he meant. He said, “Yes, you used to give me a hard
                    time.” I thought back trying to remember what he meant by that. Later on I
                    concluded that probably what he meant had to do with the civil war in Jordan in
                    1970. At that time I ran a task force for that operation in the State
                    Department. The White House was advancing the thesis that this was a cold war
                    confrontation and that the Soviets were stirring up the PLO to resist and
                    overthrow King Hussein; that the Soviets were behind the penetration of the
                    Syrian column of tanks into Jordan; and that therefore the Soviets were trying
                    to penetrate an American sphere of influence. In any case, the crisis ended and
                    the White House patted itself on the back for having stood the Soviets down. And
                    this was the line that was given to the press.</p>
                <p>Well, correspondents in the aftermath of all this would come over to see me and
                    ask me about this. And without hesitation I said that this was a lot of
                    malarkey. We had intelligence, which we thought was reliable, indicating that
                    there was no evidence indicating that the Soviets (even though they had contacts
                    with the PLO on a continuing basis and had provided some arms and probably
                    mostly money) were behind the PLO uprising in Jordan. The PLO had its own
                    reasons for doing that and their own resources. As for the Syrian invasion into
                    Jordan, we had intelligence indicating that the Soviets had intervened with the
                    Syrian government to try to get it to exercise restraint and not to get involved
                    in the PLO-Jordanian conflict. I described this to the correspondents and
                    suppose it got back to Kissinger. I can only guess that is the reason he made
                    this comment in my presence at this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I looked puzzled at the time. He also said, “Yes, you used to treat me with
                    disdain.” I thought to myself, “I wonder what he meant by that?” And then
                    thinking about that later, I remembered that at the White House there used to be
                    a Forty Committee. This was created by Kissinger to vet covert operations and in
                    two cases we had worked out a very minor effort to buttress King Hussein. One
                    was to bring in M-16 machine guns which were the latest. We wanted to do it in a
                    sub rosa fashion. I can't remember what the other operation was, but it wasn't
                    overthrowing anybody, just some kind of operation we didn't want to be known. So
                    I was the person who went over to argue the case before the Committee. And then
                    during the Jordan crisis occasionally there would be a meeting of the WASAG
                    (Washington Special Action Group) which was attended by Alexis Johnson from the
                    State Department. Also attending were Helms from CIA, Packard, Deputy Defense
                    Secretary, and also the head of the JCS at that point, Admiral Moorer. I often
                    went over with Alexis Johnson and sat behind him and occasionally was asked for
                    some data, information. Those were the only times that I had any contact with
                    Kissinger, so he must have been referring to his perception of me in those
                    meetings. So when he said, “I remember you, you treated me with disdain,” I
                    said, “Mr. Secretary, I don't ever remember treating you with disdain.” And then
                    he said, quite surprisingly, “I admired you for it.” So he admired me for
                    something that I didn't know I had done. So for some silly reason he had, I
                    guess, a love/hate feeling towards me.</p>
                <p>The Secretary went on the trip to Africa and Bill Schaufele went with him. At
                    that point, of course, Kissinger was riding high. He was Secretary of State as
                    well as controlling the National Security Council in the White House. So he had
                    a lot of power. One time in early June, Bill Schaufele was back and he often
                    took me up with him when the Secretary called him to his office. As you know the
                    Secretary had quite a temper. He would throw temper tantrums many times a day,
                    as you no doubt know. I remember once he threw a temper tantrum with us and he
                    had the custom of holding a pencil in his mouth...not laterally but vertically.
                    He threw the pencil at us and said, “Get out.” So we got out. Ten minutes later
                    his aide called and said the Secretary wanted to see us. He had calmed down.</p>
                <p>One time when we were up there Bill Schaufele told him that Governor Scranton,
                    who had just been appointed as the USUN representative had just decided to make
                    his initial trip to Africa and was taking a White House plane. The Secretary,
                    who of course was paranoid, pricked up his ears and said, “What? We can't let
                    him do that.” As I recall, Bill Schaufele said, “Well, Mr. Secretary, the White
                    House has given him the plane and authorized him to go.” So the Secretary said,
                    “We must send somebody along to keep an eye on him.” At that point they both
                    looked at me. I think this was about a week before Scranton was to go. They
                    said, “You are it. You are to go along.” So I was put in the position of being
                    assigned to go along on the trip as more or less Kissinger's spy.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Of course, Scranton had to be informed and every post had to be informed, because
                    everything had been laid on in accordance with the number of people in the
                    party, their rank, etc. Suddenly they throw in this hooker, Seelye is going
                    along. So I arrived at the Kennedy airport where we all met and I know everybody
                    wondered who the hell was this guy that Kissinger had sent. It was not an easy
                    position for me to be in. But Bill Scranton is such a wonderful person that the
                    coolness quickly evaporated and I accompanied him to several Western African
                    countries, Liberia, Senegal, Gabon and one other.</p>
                <p>We had been going for about a week when one morning in Gabon (Libreville) I was
                    awakened in my hotel room at 5:00 in the morning. I remember the sun was just
                    coming up, when there was a knock on the door. It was the duty officer from the
                    American embassy in Libreville. He said, “We have a NIACT from the Department.”
                    It was slugged “from Eagleburger for Seelye.” Just the day before we had heard
                    about the assassination of our Ambassador, Frank Meloy, in Beirut. The cable
                    said, “You probably have heard that Frank Meloy has been assassinated in Beirut
                    and the Secretary has decided that you shall undertake a mission to Beirut and
                    take his place on a temporary basis. We have reserved a seat on a flight leaving
                    Libreville tonight to return to Washington via Paris. You are to take that
                    flight.” So all I could say was “Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p>I waited two or three hours and then went up to the residence where Scranton was
                    having breakfast with Andy Steigman, our ambassador. I handed him the cable and
                    he said, “Sit down and have a cup of coffee.” After Scranton read the cable he
                    came over and puts his arm around my shoulder and didn't say anything.</p>
                <p>The Scranton party took off in about two hours for their next stop, somewhere in
                    Central Africa. But in the rush of affairs, I had forgotten to retrieve my
                    passport which was being held by the Air Force escort officer. So the plane took
                    off with my diplomatic passport. But that was no problem since the embassy fixed
                    me up with a regular passport, and back to the U.S. I went.</p>
                <p>I arrived back in Washington, got home, dumped my bags and went down to the
                    Department. It was about 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening. There was a duty officer
                    in AF who had obviously been given a cover story because he didn't know why I
                    was back. To my question about the whereabouts of the Secretary, he said, “Well,
                    he is out at Andrews Air Force Base to meet the body of Ambassador Meloy.” So I
                    sent word up to his staff that I was in AF and that when the Secretary returned
                    I was ready to see him. He got back in about an hour and I went up to meet with
                    him. I made two points to him but can't remember what one of them was. The most
                    important point was that my understanding was that the PLO was the force
                    providing security in West Beirut since the Lebanese military had fallen apart
                    and their security forces were nonexistent. West Beirut east of the green line
                    is where all the embassies were located, as well as all government ministries
                    except for the Presidency. And, of course, Meloy was killed while about to cross
                    that green line. So I said that I felt in order to perform my duties, which was
                    to re-establish contact with the Lebanese government, I needed to have effective
                    security. This could only be provided by the PLO and therefore I asked for
                    authority to deal with the PLO.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The Secretary hesitated and hesitated and said, “Well, I will tell you what we
                    will do. I will authorize your security officer to deal with his counterpart in
                    the PLO with regard to your security. But there will be no political
                    discussions, nothing at your level.” I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>I came in the next day and started reading cables. In reading the cables I saw a
                    cable which had been sent out to Frank Meloy a few days before his
                    assassination. Apparently at that point 30 days had elapsed since Frank Meloy
                    had arrived and normally diplomatic protocol forbids you to deal with any
                    government officials until you have presented your credentials to the chief of
                    state. Meloy was waiting for an opportunity to do just that, but in order to do
                    that he had to cross the green line to present his credentials to the President.
                    He was waiting for the crossing to be safe. The crossing was risky, fighting was
                    going on on the west side and also along the border line. The cable from the
                    Department that went out said in effect, “We appreciate the fact that you have
                    to be very careful about your security, but we hope that as soon as possible you
                    will cross over and present your credentials because the fact that you do not
                    have relations with key government officials is inhibiting things and making it
                    difficult for us to have a relationship.” That was the essence of the cable. To
                    me that was the cable that triggered the death of Frank Meloy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard stories that Larry Eagleburger was behind
                        that. I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: So, Meloy, as we know, took with him the economic officer, Waring.</p>
                <p>That Sunday morning after I read the cables I was up in Larry Eagleburger's
                    office and they were trying to decide who they would send with me. The embassy
                    was in kind of bad straits in terms of morale. It didn't have strong leadership
                    apparently. There was no very senior officer there. They felt the need to jack
                    it up as well as to undertake this political mission. Larry Eagleburger had with
                    him the head of security whom I had known and who said, “Well, what about Ray
                    Hunt?” I said, “That's a great idea.” I knew him slightly and thought very
                    highly of him. So they called in Ray Hunt—poor Ray Hunt—and said, “Ray, how
                    about going along with Seelye to Beirut?” Ray looked shocked. He said, “Well,
                    let me think about it.” He already had a mission doing something, going on a
                    Presidential trip or something. He said, “Well, I will have to cancel all this.”
                    “Never mind, this is more important,” said Eagleburger.</p>
                <p>That is how it was that Ray came along. We didn't really have much choice.
                    Although some people said later on that we could have had a choice, but I never
                    thought I had a choice.</p>
                <p>Then, another person was brought in. My security officer from Tunisia, Robbie
                    Robinson just happened to have come back by ship. They said, “We have to send
                    two security officers, how about sending him along.” I said, “Fine.” So Robinson
                    also came along. They also added as the second security officer to accompany me,
                    McCarthy, who was then with Nancy Kissinger.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>So we were planning the trip. The next question was how to get me into Beirut
                    because the airport had been closed for five or six months. I heard from the
                    grapevine that CIA was being consulted on ways to get me in surreptitiously. All
                    kinds of hair-raising ideas were being offered. Then Henry Kissinger said,
                    “Well, I am meeting with my chiefs of mission in Paris on Wednesday. You come to
                    Paris, I want you to be there. Then position yourself in Paris until we can get
                    you into Beirut.</p>
                <p>So, everything was done in a hurry. I think it was Monday that we took off, I
                    can't remember, the two security officers and I and Ray Hunt. In the rush of
                    affairs we arrived at Dulles airport and I had left my air tickets on my bureau
                    in my bedroom. Well, that didn't cause me any problems as we were flying TWA and
                    the security people said they would take care of it. We arrived in Paris and the
                    funny thing was that Kissinger was so security conscious, as he still is, that
                    every chief of mission from the Arab world assigned to that Paris meeting was
                    assigned a security car with a French policeman while in Paris. This meant me
                    too. It was ridiculous. Here I was with these two security officers plus one or
                    two French cars.</p>
                <p>We met with Kissinger in the secure “tank” in the embassy. I will never forget
                    that meeting because attending were Hermann Eilts from Egypt, Bill Porter from
                    Saudi Arabia, Pickering from Jordan, and Murphy from Syria, etc. The meeting had
                    hardly started when Hermann Eilts, of all people, said to the Secretary, “When
                    are we going to recognize the PLO?” Well, that stunned me because Hermann, who
                    is a brilliant Foreign Service officer, outstanding, is also cautious and
                    careful. He was the last person I would have thought at a meeting like this
                    would have said that. Well, that provided the opening. I jumped in and said,
                    “Now that is a good point. I am going to Beirut and the PLO is operating there.”
                    So the whole meeting started off on the PLO and the Secretary was kind of put
                    off by this offensive. He made some comment, “Never have I been pressed so much
                    on the PLO in my life.”</p>
                <p>Of course, the Secretary had made a commitment to the Israelis during the
                    disengagement talks of 1973 and 1974, that the U.S. would neither recognize nor
                    negotiate with the PLO. But he always claimed that he had not precluded a
                    dialogue—that the intention of that undertaking was to leave a loophole for
                    dialogue. This loophole, however, was closed by successive administrations
                    either inadvertently or advertently...Carter and Reagan.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>We had that meeting with our Middle East ambassadors. Before I left Washington I
                    had said that while in Beirut it would be useful to have somebody over on the
                    East side representing me since obviously it would be inadvisable for me to try
                    to cross the green line in view of what happened to my predecessor. The
                    President was located in East Beirut, where things were safe, and also located
                    there were Maronite leaders and leaders of parties I ought to be in touch with.
                    So somebody said, “What about Ed Djerejian?” who at that point was consul
                    somewhere in southern France. So Ed came up to Paris and we talked together. I
                    said to Kissinger in the “tank,” “I have a proposal that Ed be located over
                    there and that we have a walkie-talkie scrambler so I can talk to him without
                    being overheard.” Kissinger thought it was a great idea. However, Djerejian
                    never came because at the last minute his wife, with whom he had been married
                    for only a short time, threw a fit and said that she wouldn't let him go, it was
                    too dangerous—although East Beirut was a lot safer than West Beirut. So that
                    never worked out.</p>
                <p>We had been in Paris for two or three days when suddenly word came that the
                    airport in Beirut had miraculously opened up after five or six months of being
                    shut tight. I was told to fly immediately to Athens and get ready to fly to
                    Beirut, which I did. But the news came in about 11:00 at night and the security
                    officer in Paris said they had to give me a pseudonym. He proposed Cohen, or
                    something like that. I said, “I don't think that would be an appropriate
                    pseudonym in that part of the world. Let's think of another one.” So he thought
                    of another one. I was also given a flak jacket with bullet proof vest and a
                    London Fog bullet proof raincoat. Of course it never rains in Beirut in June. I
                    tried on the flak jacket in my Paris hotel room and found that there was only
                    one suit jacket I could put over it without looking too bulky.</p>
                <p>So there were four flak jackets given to us and the party turned out to be, me,
                    Ray Hunt, the two security officers and some young communications guy. There
                    were five of us but only four flak jackets and one London Fog raincoat. The
                    raincoat was given to the communications guy who was about 5'2” talk so it came
                    down to his ankles. We got to Athens and shortly thereafter the first plane left
                    Beirut airport and arrived in Athens. So we were at the airport to take it back
                    to Beirut. Nat Howell came off and some others, breathing heavy sighs of relief.
                    We, somewhat apprehensively got on the plane with our pseudonyms. We were in
                    first class. The flight attendants were all smiles. They wanted to know our
                    names and I gave them my pseudonym. They smiled in a way leading me to believe
                    they knew exactly who we were and that we weren't fooling anybody. There were
                    very few passengers on the plane, needless to say.</p>
                <p>We flew in over Beirut very low and landed at the airport. My security people,
                    who were overly security conscientious, told me to be the last one off. Then
                    they gave me the signal and as I emerged from the door of the plane, there at
                    the top of the steps was a nattily dressed military type who turned out to be a
                    PLO major who greeted me and escorted me to my car. It was the ambassador's
                    armored car. The ambassador's chauffeur was also killed in that crossing and I
                    will mention more about that later. His successor was sitting on the seat like
                    this, crouched way down with just his head showing above the window.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Oh, one thing I might mention. Before I left Washington I was invited to
                    President Ford's office because I was supposed to be a Presidential emissary for
                    some reason or other. We were talking about my mission and he said, “Is there
                    anything that we can do for you?” And I said, “Yes, I understand that the morale
                    at the embassy is understandably low and it would be nice if we had some new
                    Hollywood films.” So he turned to Brent Scowcroft and said, “Let's do that.” So
                    a footlocker of films had been produced and were on the plane with us. But it
                    took longer to get that footlocker off. So I was sitting in that car waiting for
                    that footlocker of films to be off loaded and we could hear shells in the
                    distance and shooting not too far away. The driver was slumped down in his seat
                    with a PLO major sitting to his right and my security officers were sitting with
                    me and Ray Hunt was in the car behind me. I began to wonder if it was worth
                    waiting for those films. Finally they managed to extricate the footlocker and
                    off we went.</p>
                <p>In front of us was a pickup truck full of PLO soldiers and another PLO pickup
                    truck in back of our little convoy as we started out to the embassy. We took a
                    bypass around Beirut. Once we went by artillery pieces firing away at some
                    target. Anyway, we got to the embassy safely. The next morning Ray Hunt
                    immediately began to focus in on management and administrative problems and
                    rearranged offices so that my office was not so high up and vulnerable but lower
                    down in the building.</p>
                <p>The next day the PLO set up mortars right next to the embassy. Now from the
                    embassy we could see Junieh across the Bay of Beirut. Junieh was the
                    headquarters of the Lebanese Forces, the Maronite militia. The fighting going on
                    was pretty much between them and militia elements on the West side composed of
                    PLO, leftist Moslem groups, etc. This was the nature of the confrontation at
                    that point. The PLO started firing mortar rounds toward Junieh. We could see the
                    smoke where the rounds dropped. And then Junieh started firing back. Fortunately
                    the returned shells didn't hit the embassy but several landed on the AUB campus,
                    fortunately with limited damage. To this day I don't know if they purposefully
                    avoided the embassy or if they just didn't target very well, but we were spared.
                    Clearly the PLO did that as a kind of provocation.</p>
                <p>The afternoon of the next day we heard that the next MEA plane that came in had
                    been hit by a shell from Junieh and the co-pilot had been killed and the plane
                    damaged. The airport was shut again for another four or five months. So I had
                    gotten in in a two-day opening. I have no idea why that window of two days
                    developed, whether it was to let me in.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I obviously was not going to be bound by any protocol regarding presenting
                    credentials and started my round of calls on Lebanese officials. Every time I
                    was about to make a call my security people would go out and with the PLO plot
                    the route of my approach and reconnoiter. And so that was what we did. I did
                    this for a couple of weeks and began to think this was kind of senseless.
                    Fighting was going on and you could tell when you left the embassy when it was
                    dangerous and when it wasn't. There was kind of an innate sense that people had
                    if there was danger or not. Sometimes you would leave the embassy and along the
                    Corniche you would see peddlers moving around. Other times there would be nobody
                    on the streets, just totally empty and you knew that there was a rumor that
                    fighting was about to erupt in that area.</p>
                <p>But we went out anyway. One time we were calling on Kamal Jumblatt, who was a
                    leading figure in the Socialist Party, head of the Druze, I could hear shells
                    coming closer as we came out. Our security people said, “Come on let's get into
                    the car and get the hell out of here.” So we did and on the way one of our cars
                    stalled, not my car, and we all stopped. Somebody appeared from nowhere, he used
                    to work for the embassy, and said he would get a battery. So we left that car
                    and went on. I said to the security people, “If it was getting dangerous, why
                    didn't you come in and interrupt my meeting?” They had also said they had seen
                    cars from one of the Palestinian radical groups circling the building I was in.
                    They said they thought the meeting was important. I said, “No meeting is that
                    important if you have threats from these groups.”</p>
                <p>Well, those were the kinds of conditions we were operating in. I realized that
                    was no way to conduct diplomacy and it really wasn't very feasible to continue
                    on in that fashion for very long.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile we looked into what had happened to Meloy. Several things were quite
                    significant in my mind. One was that the arrangement for the meeting with the
                    President, let's say for 10:00 in the morning, had been made over the telephone,
                    so it was known to those who were listening to our phones. Secondly, the embassy
                    took a long time, longer than it should have, in checking back to see if the
                    Ambassador had arrived at his destination. Let's say he was due to arrive at
                    10:00, it wasn't until maybe 11:00 or later that the embassy called, or maybe
                    the Palace called asking where the Ambassador was. So crucial time passed which
                    could have been utilized to save his life.</p>
                <p>Then, after the party left the embassy, maybe an hour later, but after obviously
                    the Ambassador had been taken, a call was received by the wife of the chauffeur.
                    The chauffeur had been a terrific chauffeur, he had risked his life on many
                    occasions during the civil war and had been very loyal to the American embassy.
                    A call had been received by his wife saying, “We have so-and-so, but don't
                    worry, he will be all right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Thirdly, the Ambassadors' cars in those days were rigged with a concealed
                    microphone in the ceiling. You had a button to the right of your seat that you
                    could press if you were in a dangerous situation. That would trigger the
                    microphone and then the microphone would play back to the Marine Guard office.
                    So the embassy could hear what was going on and take steps accordingly. That
                    button had never been pressed in the case of Meloy. Nothing was heard at the
                    Marine headquarters. Either it hadn't worked or it hadn't been pressed. My guess
                    is that it had not been pressed, because my reading is that probably what
                    happened was that the chauffeur had been blackmailed into agreeing to a friendly
                    kidnapping. [This is just my view.] That is, the car would be stopped and the
                    party would be kidnapped for political purposes, with no intention of killing
                    them. They would be held and then all released. The kidnappers wanted to make a
                    political point. Presumably the chauffeur had been put under such terrible
                    pressure, maybe with threats to the life of his wife and family, that he figured
                    that since no one was going to get killed he would go along with it. Further
                    substantiation of this is the fact that as the party was approaching the green
                    line, the chauffeur, on his radio mike, told the backup car to turn around and
                    go back because he said it wasn't needed anymore. The Ambassador obviously had
                    not known about this exchange because it was in Arabic. Frank didn't speak
                    Arabic, didn't know what the chauffeur was saying and probably didn't notice
                    that the backup car had turned around. This substantiates my thesis.</p>
                <p>Evidently the party arrived at a prearranged area where guys with guns stopped
                    the car. The driver presumably says, “Mr. Ambassador don't worry about this,
                    these are friendly parties,” and opens up the window and the guns were poked in.
                    And the group is taken. The driver probably told the Ambassador that this was a
                    friendly group, so he did not press the button.</p>
                <p>We learned later that the group that had taken the Ambassador, Waring and the
                    chauffeur somehow turned them over or they were grabbed by a communist group,
                    another group. Circumstances are unclear regarding the transfer. But they were
                    evidently moved and killed immediately and put into body bags and within a
                    matter of a couple of hours after the scheduled meeting their bodies were found
                    on the Corniche.</p>
                <p>The PLO was informed of the action because it was in charge of security. But it
                    was quite upset because of tardiness in informing the PLO. They said, “Look, if
                    you had notified us sooner we probably could have tracked down the kidnappers
                    right away and saved the lives of the party.” Which very likely could have been
                    the case. That to me is the only explanation of how this could have
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Later on we found the Ambassador's vehicle in an abandoned garage intact. I had
                    the unpleasant task of presenting a plaque to the driver's widow and two sons on
                    the occasion of his death.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give a little feel, what was this all about? Why
                        was one group trying to kill the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, you start out with the stigma attached to the close U.S.-Israeli
                    relationship. That is the underlying consideration. Radical groups equate the
                    U.S. with Israel, which had been beating up Palestinians and taken Palestinian
                    land, etc. More than that, with regard to the Lebanese political dynamics,
                    Muslim radicals alleged U.S. support for the Christian Maronite faction.
                    Officially the U.S. did not support the Maronite faction. We were neutral. In
                    fact, while I was in Beirut I frequently made public statements and interviews
                    saying that we were neutral, wanted a reunited Lebanon and believed in
                    preserving Lebanon's territorial integrity. And, in fact, we were very skeptical
                    of the Maronites because they were causing a lot of problems. They helped
                    stimulate the start of the civil war. So there was no truth in fact for their
                    belief that we supported them on the political level. On the other hand, I have
                    learned since then that the CIA was probably feeding them some stuff. Certainly
                    they were later, whether they were at that time I don't know. I should have
                    known if they were at that time. Be that as it may, the radical faction no doubt
                    assumed that this was what we were doing, that we were helping the Maronites
                    with equipment and money because they were well-heeled.</p>
                <p>Those were two basic reasons. A third, of course, was that the communists
                    obviously got Soviet money and the Soviets were anti-American, so they shared
                    the anti-American orientation of the Soviets. They were the ones who killed
                    Meloy. Those who had kidnapped Meloy had not intended to kill. That is my
                    theory...they just wanted to make a political point. So the killers were those
                    with a Soviet connection. So this is a third element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you arrived in Beirut. Obviously it is
                        dangerous, there is a war going on and our embassy is in the line of fire.
                        Something that I have wondered about for a long time, what were we doing
                        there? Common sense would say, “Okay, let's get out of here and go to
                        Cyprus. If you want to talk to us you can come to Cyprus,” or something of
                        that nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, eventually, I felt very much that way and cut the embassy down to a
                    hard core. But the reason we kept even the hard core, in my view, was because it
                    would have been terribly demoralizing to our friends in Lebanon had we pulled
                    out entirely. Keep in mind the Lebanese had attached tremendous importance to
                    U.S. relations. In fact, greater importance than they probably should have. I
                    don't know if you have served in Lebanon, but whenever there were elections
                    there, each party would go to the American embassy to get support because they
                    assumed that we could wave a wand and get anybody elected. This was, of course,
                    not true, but they just assumed the United States was there to help them. If we
                    had pulled out it would have been extraordinarily demoralizing to them. And it
                    would have led to other friendly Western embassies pulling out. It would have
                    led to a chain reaction and psychologically I think we felt it would have been
                    disastrous. So that is the reason I think we stayed on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said chain reaction, what would the end result of the
                        chain reaction be and why would it be a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I think people would have felt that they had been abandoned by the
                    West and lost hope. It might have caused who knows what kind of reaction. In any
                    case, we could afford to have a small attachment there. In addition to overall
                    PLO security, remnants of one of the Lebanese military factions guarded the
                    embassy. Also the AUB was still there. Here was the American University of
                    Beirut next door to us. The AUB faculty was still there. They would have been
                    very distraught had the United States pulled out its embassy. In fact, an
                    amusing thing happened while I was there. We ran low on mazut, which was the
                    term for kerosene, and all our heating ran on mazut. The PLO had control of the
                    resources. The AUB hospital told the PLO at one point that it was running out of
                    mazut and therefore couldn't treat PLO fighters any more. So the PLO said,
                    “Don't worry we will give you mazut for the hospital and the AUB campus will
                    function.” So we connected our lines up with the AUB lines and in effect the PLO
                    was providing us with mazut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it just seems that we found ourselves hostage to
                        forces even, you might say, the friendly ones. It was a Middle East squabble
                        that within the context of American interests it seems we could pull out and
                        say, “Look, you people settle your own problems, we are not going to put our
                        own people in danger.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I would have agreed if it hadn't been a country with such a close
                    relationship with the U.S., including the presence of the American University of
                    Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you conduct your business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the PLO would come by in their pickup trucks with armed PLO
                    fighters to escort me to calls on the foreign minister, or prime minister, or
                    whomever. We would exchange views which I would report back to Washington. But I
                    realized that this was not that important and really wasn't worth my risking my
                    life and the life of my security people. As long as our people were hemmed up in
                    the embassy, I felt that it wasn't quite so bad because I had never thought at
                    that point that anybody was going to attack the embassy. Certainly the people in
                    the East, the Maronites, weren't going to, and the PLO had a mandate to protect
                    us and wouldn't attack us. So there wasn't any concern on my part that the
                    embassy, itself, would be attacked. Although one day, I know after I left, I was
                    told that a bullet had been found in the bed in which I had been sleeping. It
                    had come in through a window and ricocheted or something. Maybe it was
                    inadvisable to keep our people there, I don't know. At the time we thought it
                    was advisable.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>So, I traveled around and I slept in the embassy. Some of the embassy staff lived
                    in houses outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of holed up in the embassy. This was before
                        the time that a lot of hostages were being taken. How were we viewing at
                        that time the outcome of the civil war? It sounds like nobody was going to
                        get the upper hand and a lot of people were going to get killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: One thing I didn't mention was that there was a belief on the part of
                    some Lebanese, and I don't mean to say Lebanese who were friendly to the United
                    States, that our policy basically was to Balkanize Lebanon. There would be a
                    Maronite area, a Shiite area, etc. I was constantly trying to refute this
                    notion. Raymond Edde, a Maronite leader who had good relations with the Moslems,
                    felt that way. He claimed that he had been told that by Kissinger. I denied it.
                    Our official policy was to keep Lebanon intact. We were urging the parties to
                    get together but we had no capability of getting them together. We would make
                    public statements assuring everybody we believed in their getting together and
                    wanting them to get together, but policy is limited by capability. There really
                    wasn't anything specific we could do at that point beyond hoping that the war
                    would begin to ease off. And, of course, none of us...that was 1976...thought it
                    was going to last another 16 years.</p>

                        Were they giving you any prognosis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: They were prisoners of their lousy reports. The trouble with DIA and CIA,
                    particularly with CIA, is, as you know, they pay for their information.
                    Therefore there tends to be an assumption that if you pay for information it is
                    more accurate than information that isn't paid for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a horrendous leap of faith.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Oh, terrible. Let me give you a specific example. At one point the
                    station chief and the military attach� came to me and said, “We have to evacuate
                    because the Maronite militia are about to launch an attack on West Beirut and we
                    will be right in the line of fire.” I said, “What makes you think that?” They
                    said, “Look at all these reports.” I said, “Well, you look at them. Read them
                    again. What they say is that this is what the militia leaders say they are going
                    to do, but that doesn't mean they are going to do it or be able to do it,
                    because the Syrians are right on the outskirts of Beirut and they aren't going
                    to allow these guys to do it. And they know the Syrians are there and therefore
                    they aren't going to try it. They are just shooting off their mouths.” So they
                    pulled back and about ten years later I happened to bump into the CIA station
                    chief and he said, “You were right.” Well, I was right only because of common
                    sense. They were believing their reports. So there was no prognosis that the CIA
                    or DIA could provide me that I didn't have a better feel for. But nobody could
                    provide a prognosis as to when the civil war was going to end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and members of your embassy tend to look upon
                        this whole thing in Lebanon? What were we doing; how did we hope it would
                        work out; etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Unfortunately, I had a very weak political staff at that point. Nat
                    Howell had left and there were a couple of young officers who were new and there
                    wasn't much I could tap there. Ray Hunt was an administrative type so I was
                    pretty much on my own. But I concluded and sent in a cable to this effect, that
                    until the Arab-Israeli problem was solved, the Lebanese problem would continue
                    to fester. You had all the Palestinians there and the Maronite and Palestinian
                    confrontation which was very serious. The Maronites were so resentful of the
                    large Palestinian element that Lebanon couldn't be put back together until we
                    made progress on the Arab-Israeli problem. Well, I heard later that that caused
                    a big rumpus back in Washington. The White House—by that time at the NSC it was
                    not Scowcroft but the Russian expert—saw the cable and called Kissinger's
                    attention to it. Kissinger was very upset for some reason or other that that
                    kind of an analysis should be made, I am told by people back in NEA, and blew
                    his stack that Seelye should be making that kind of analysis. Well, that is what
                    we are paid to do, to make analyses like that. But that is not what Washington
                    wanted to believe. They wanted to believe that somehow you could solve it
                    without relevance to anything else.</p>
                <p>But that certainly was my conclusion then, that it was going to rather
                    along—until we made progress on the Arab-Israeli problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>SEELYE: At that point the Syrians were very restrained. They were too restrained,
                    in my view, because one of the worst massacres occurred while I was there, the
                    massacre of Tall Za'tar. Tall Za'tar was the main refugee camp then that was a
                    focal point for the Palestinian resistance movement. The Maronite militia
                    decided to take it on. The Syrians, who came into Lebanon to prevent the
                    Maronites from being eclipsed and defeated by their opponents—Syria's objective
                    was to maintain balance between the factions—were at that point in league with
                    the Maronite militia. They had for the moment abandoned their former friends,
                    the communists, Moslem nationalists and socialists, in order to help the
                    Maronites. And the Maronites knew that so they began to plaster Tall Za'tar with
                    bombs and shells. On the radio I listened to these plaintive calls from Tall
                    Za'tar, “Help us, help us, we are besieged and beleaguered.” Finally, the Tall
                    Za'tar leader said, “Okay, we give up,” and the Palestinians walked out with
                    white flags and were mowed down by the Maronites. Hundreds and hundreds were
                    killed. And the Syrians, of course, had blood on their hands because they did
                    not intervene. So at that point they were around Beirut but not in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: None whatsoever. In fact, at one point, there was a suggestion that I
                    meet with the famous Shiite leader who disappeared in Libya, Imam Sadr, who was
                    a rising star among the Shiites. As you know, the Shiites were the depressed
                    people of Lebanon. They were beginning to assert themselves. I heard at that
                    point that Imam Sadr was very close to the Syrians, indeed even perhaps a Syrian
                    agent. I said, “No, I don't want to do that because it might look as if I am
                    consorting with a Syrian agent.” I think I made a mistake, I probably should
                    have met him, but I didn't. At that point I was extremely sensitive about
                    involving myself with a Syrian connection. But we didn't foresee the future
                    Syrian involvement in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that caused the Syrians to be able to maintain
                        a civil war for 16 years and to be so brutal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well the Syrians didn't maintain it. They obviously facilitated it, but
                    it was an indigenous war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was it that kept on this very brutal
                        fighting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the Syrians didn't keep the fighting going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not the Syrians, the Lebanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I can't answer that question because I never would have thought
                    that the civilized Lebanese could ever have lowered themselves to such
                    bestiality and brutalities as occurred. It is absolutely unbelievable and to me
                    still inexplicable. It got so bad that Muslims would stop any car with
                    Christians and shoot them and vice versa, right there on the spot. It was awful.
                    It became absolutely terrible. And I cannot explain it. I can explain why
                    Lebanon broke into a civil war, there are a lot of reasons for that. The fact
                    that you had these feudal politicians who were running the show and the poor
                    people in the south who had nothing. The big gap between rich and poor. The
                    Palestinian incursion that threatened the dominating Maronites. All those things
                    contributed to the starting of the civil war, but I cannot explain how it became
                    so brutal. It was just beyond belief.</p>
                <p>The Syrians believed in maintaining a balance of power in Lebanon that enabled
                    them to dominate. They played factions off against the other, but that didn't
                    mean they wanted the fighting to continue. It was much easier for them for the
                    situation to be peaceful. So the Syrians did not want the civil war to continue.
                    Also they didn't want any one faction to win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, who was contributing...after
                        all when you fire off mortars, mortars are expensive...where was the money
                        coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, the PLO was getting most of its funding from Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were they getting their supplies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc. The Saudis were providing a lot of
                    money. The Kuwaitis to a certain extent. Also, the Palestinians working in Saudi
                    Arabia and Kuwait had two percent of their salaries deducted, which went to the
                    PLO cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were the Maronites getting their equipment,
                        etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, they were getting money from wealthy Lebanese who had fled to
                    Europe and probably from some French sources. They had a close relationship with
                    France. Later on they were getting weapons from Israel. About the time I was
                    there Israel apparently started providing American weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you getting from the desk. You
                        sent back cables saying that this was something that was going to be solved
                        unless the Arab-Israeli situation was solved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I was talking every day with Maury Draper via radio telephone. I was
                    sending cables back for general distribution, but talking every day with the
                    desk. I was only there about five and a half weeks. I might say that before I
                    left for Beirut, Kissinger said, “If you want to be ambassador, I will make you
                    ambassador there.” I said, “Well, let me go over there and take a look.” And
                    after two weeks there I decided I didn't want to be Ambassador to Lebanon so I
                    sent a cable back saying, “Thanks very much, I don't want to be Ambassador to
                    Lebanon.” But that just showed you the power that Kissinger had. He could say
                    that you could be ambassador if you wanted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I went in in mid-June and must have come back in early August. I was
                    there about six weeks. I said, “Look, we should cut down the embassy, I'll pull
                    out, have no senior officer here, pull in our tentacles.” There had been an
                    evacuation before that, so we negotiated a second evacuation, offering it to
                    non-embassy Americans in Beirut as well. At first we thought we would fly out if
                    we could get the Christian militia to hold fire for a day. I called a contact on
                    the Maronite side and said, “Could you check with all the militia and see if
                    they wouldn't agree for half a day to lay off so that we could evacuate
                    Americans?” After a day or so he called back and said, “I have assurances from
                    all except one group that is on the hills above the airport. I can't get their
                    assurances.” So I told Washington that we couldn't evacuate by air and I would
                    look into evacuating by land.</p>
                <p>It was considered too dangerous to go on the main road to Damascus, but there was
                    a circuitous route to the south. My intermediary with Arafat was the Egyptian
                    Ambassador. So I asked him to contact Arafat and see if he could provide us with
                    some security for a column to go south of Beirut and out. Word came back that we
                    could do this. So we got all ready and notified Americans to be ready at various
                    collection points. The night before, Arafat sent word that he couldn't guarantee
                    security after all, it was too dangerous. I didn't know at that point if that
                    was a political ploy by Arafat just to stick the knife in, or whether it was
                    truly a security problem. Two years ago when I was in Tunis with a group I went
                    to see him and asked him specifically that question, “When you backed off on
                    your undertaking to escort our convoy, was that for political reasons or for
                    security reasons?” He said, “Security reasons, we had information that made it
                    difficult for us to assure that we could protect you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I then notified Washington that we couldn't go out by land. Kissinger sent a
                    rocket as was his custom saying in effect, “In that case, we are going to send
                    in the Sixth Fleet and evacuate that way, to hell with the PLO. You just tell
                    them that we are coming in with landing craft.” I thought that we couldn't
                    operate this way in this environment. Tell the PLO we are coming in? That is a
                    threat and we need the PLO to help us to evacuate. We couldn't evacuate under
                    dangerous conditions. So I deliberated and decided to do it my way, figuring I
                    was risking something because if it hadn't worked out my way I would have had to
                    tell Kissinger that the PLO refused to help—and he hadn't asked me to check with
                    the PLO.</p>
                <p>I said to the Egyptian Ambassador, “Look, we have to get out by sea. I wonder if
                    you could get Arafat to agree to help us evacuate. He has been very helpful in
                    providing my security. All we need to do is secure an evacuation point by the
                    sea and just help us. Would he be kind enough to do that?” That was in late
                    morning and I had several hours of apprehension waiting for the response. I
                    thought, well, if word came back “no,” what was I going to do? We wanted to get
                    the people out, but we couldn't bring in the Sixth Fleet without PLO help. I
                    would have had to go back and say, “No, the Sixth Fleet can't come in this way.”
                    Anyway, as it turned out the Egyptian Ambassador called back later in the
                    afternoon and said, “Yes, the PLO will help.” I didn't tell Washington how I
                    handled it, I just told them to let me know what their timing was and we would
                    be set.</p>
                <p>So a couple of days later Washington notified us that landing craft were coming
                    in, so we had people collected to evacuate. And to this day, Kissinger and
                    others don't know—I guess Maury Draper knows because I told him—that we didn't
                    do it the way Kissinger had asked us to do it, which was to just tell them they
                    have to comply. So we evacuated, including myself. We took the landing craft and
                    the security people were so security conscious that they forced me to go below.
                    The craft took us to another ship which was like a mother ship that opened up
                    and the landing craft just floated in. Then they sent helicopters and we flew to
                    the aircraft carrier where we had lunch with the commanding officer. After lunch
                    we were put into a little plane and catapulted off the deck, which is quite an
                    experience because you are facing backward and a guy comes to you and says,
                    “Attach your harness” and it is like, “boom” and suddenly there you are 300 feet
                    away from the aircraft carrier. It is an incredible experience. We flew to
                    Athens.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Commander of the Sixth Fleet, Fred Turner, whom I had known when I
                    was in Tunisia said, “Why don't you come with me, I will escort you back?” I
                    said, “No, that takes too long, but thank you very much,” and flew back
                    directly.</p>
                <p>Lebanese were not very happy at our pulling out. It was kind of demoralizing to
                    have a second embassy evacuation although the embassy remained with a small
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got back to Washington, what was the feeling you
                        got?</hi>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>SEELYE: When I got back to Washington I had, of course, to report to Kissinger. I
                    got a feeling that people weren't overjoyed about developments. I got the
                    feeling that Kissinger was mad at me, maybe because of that cable I had
                    sent.</p>
                <p>Oh, another thing I did. At one point I cabled asking permission to make a
                    statement because there was a lot of misunderstanding about what our policy was
                    at that point. The atmosphere was charged and I thought a statement made in a
                    certain way would be helpful. Washington cabled back and authorized me to make
                    it, but apparently it did so without checking with Kissinger. He had a
                    passionate obsession of not allowing ambassadors to ever express themselves
                    publicly, even in an official position. It was just his paranoia. I heard later
                    that he thought I had done this on my own. So I had two strikes against me when
                    I went back.</p>
                <p>Finally after a couple of days after my return from Beirut Kissinger received me.
                    Of course, he was all sweetness and light. He is the most duplicitous official
                    that ever lived. He was probably damning me to others and to my face he kept
                    saying what a great job I had done, etc. And then I went back to my AF
                    duties.</p>
                <p>I don't think it ever affected my relations with Kissinger because I saw him
                    after that. I remember one time he called me at home when Bill Schaufele was
                    away on a trip, Sunday morning about 8:00 and said, “Have you seen the latest
                    cables from Angola [or something]?” I said, “Oh, Mr. Secretary, I am still at
                    home.” “Well, we have to get some responses out right away.” Anyway I went down
                    to the Department and brought people in and we drafted cables. I called him at
                    home about 3:00 or 4:00 that afternoon to tell him we were all set. Then he
                    began to reminisce, he said, “Well, I will get you out to the Middle East in
                    another six months.” So, I guess he got over these things. That was the end of
                    my Lebanese connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the Africa things, what did you find your main
                        tasks were? You kept it up until 1978, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, yes, I kept it up. Bill Schaufele was really an old African hand
                    and knew what he was doing. I was learning and was just kind of his alter ego. I
                    don't know that I was assigned any special tasks. I fit in wherever I could.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>When he was gone I had to testify on the Hill. Once I remember having to testify
                    on the Hill on our aid package for Africa. In those days we had an aid package,
                    economic and military. The subcommittee was headed by Congressman Diggs, who was
                    an African American who was very interested in Africa. I made my canned
                    presentation. What you do is submit something in writing and then you kind of
                    summarize it. I noticed up on the dais there was an empty space with a marker
                    “Congressman Stephen Solarz.” I didn't think much about it. After about half an
                    hour into the testimony, Solarz appeared, very jaunty and kind of
                    self-important. He sat down and immediately asked me a question. Somehow
                    Solarz's deportment put me off and what put me off even more was that I had
                    answered that question previously in my testimony, so I found myself saying, I
                    don't know why, to Solarz, “Well, Congressman Solarz, if you had been here on
                    time you would have heard the answer to your question. I have already given the
                    answer.” I then turned to Diggs and said, “Mr. Chairman, would you like me to
                    repeat for the benefit of Congressman Solarz what I said earlier?” He said,
                    “Yes, please do.” Well, Congressman Solarz never forgot that and I will tell you
                    a story about that later on.</p>
                <p>Then what happened was—I mentioned earlier that Kissinger was zeroing in on
                    Africa—that after Kissinger came back from Africa he started calling a daily
                    meeting in his office every day at 10:00, called the African group meeting,
                    which no other geographical bureau, to my knowledge, enjoyed. Every day we would
                    see the Secretary at the same time. This, of course, was terribly useful because
                    we could use that meeting to get his approval for things we wanted done. And at
                    that meeting he would call in—he always liked to have a big group—Phil Habib,
                    who was Under Secretary for Political Affairs; Robinson, his deputy, when he was
                    around; Winston Lord, who was sort of his political counselor; John Reinhardt
                    from USIA; and Bill Schaufele and me; and his notetaker from the White House,
                    Peter Rodman. That was the Africa group which met every morning at 10:00
                    sometimes for ten minutes and sometimes for twenty. We met for several months
                    like that. It was unbelievable. According to Peter Rodman at one point he was
                    working on a third book by Kissinger but it was never finished. This book would
                    have touched on this period of the African group meetings.</p>
                <p>Then the Republicans lost the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the election of November, 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>SEELYE: That's right. I might add parenthetically that Kissinger still used to
                    needle me, even though I was in African Affairs, about my alleged PLO
                    connection. Oh, yeah, I skipped something. When I was in Paris, waiting to go to
                    Beirut, Kissinger took me aside at one point and said, “Now, I have given you
                    permission to have your security officer deal with the PLO. This is to be
                    secret.” As if this could be kept secret. “If this gets out I will have to
                    repudiate you.” This is vintage Kissinger. He never stood up for subordinates,
                    as we know. So Kissinger used to needle me about the PLO from time to time. I
                    remember one time I escorted the South African Ambassador into his office. The
                    South African Ambassador was his favorite so Kissinger allowed him to take the
                    private elevator which was also used by Dobrynin. During the meeting Kissinger
                    suddenly looked at me and looked back at the South African Ambassador and said,
                    “You know Talcott Seelye?” And he said, “Yes.” “He is our PLO man in the State
                    Department.”</p>
                <p>At the last meeting Kissinger had in January before the Democrats came in in
                    1976, he called together the 30-40 top people in the State Department. Again
                    Bill Schaufele was away so I was there sitting in the middle of the long table.
                    While he was telling everybody to continue business as usual until the new boys
                    took over, he stopped in the middle and said, “I don't want Seelye in this
                    interregnum recognizing the PLO.” There wasn't a crack of a smile on anybody's
                    face although this was obviously a facetious dig.</p>
                <p>Then at one point just before that he said to me, “Don't worry, when we have won
                    the election, we will have a dialogue with the PLO.” Of course, you could never
                    believe anything he said, never.</p>
                <p>So, I arrived in AF in March, and now it is January 1977. The new administration
                    comes in and Vance tells Bill Schaufele he wants to keep him on for continuity.
                    So Bill stays on for about three or four months and then the shoe drops. The
                    White House decides that it wants its own man for this position. It wanted a man
                    clearly identified with the new Carter policy. So Dick Moose was selected to
                    take over African Affairs. He was then Under Secretary for Administration, the
                    job he has now. They told Bill Schaufele that they would get him an
                    ambassadorship, which they did eventually. Meanwhile, what to do with me. I said
                    to Bill rashly, “Bill, you brought me in here, you go, I go.” I had already had
                    a few differences with Warren Christopher, who was Under Secretary, and is today
                    Secretary, and who was the point man for human rights. Sometimes we thought that
                    he carried it a little too far in terms of emphasizing human rights at the
                    expense of other more important considerations.</p>
                <p>In any case, I just said to Bill that if he was going, I was going, and I wanted
                    to get back to the Middle East anyway. Africa was not my bag and I didn't know
                    Dick Moose. I said I would overlap with Dick. So Bill went off to his
                    ambassadorship. I think Dick tried to get me a couple of ambassadorships, but I
                    have a feeling Christopher turned them down.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>In any case I turned my duties over to Bill Harrop and went on leave for a couple
                    of weeks in mid August after having overlapped with Dick Moose a couple of
                    weeks. While I was on leave I got a call from Carol Laise, who was then Director
                    General. She said, “What are you going to do?” I said that I didn't have the
                    vaguest idea. “Well,” she said, “You have to do something. The promotion boards
                    are coming up, how about heading a promotion board?” I said, “Sure.” I went back
                    to Washington to head a promotion board for FSOs from 4 to 3 or 5 to 4, or
                    whatever it was, which was an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>Just as I started, Bill Harrop called me and said, “We would like you to go for
                    us back to Africa to attend in Zaire some anniversary of Mobutu's coming to
                    power. Would I go?” I said, “Sure.” So I left the panel and flew out to Zaire. I
                    got in the boat with Mobutu and had a private meeting with him, etc.</p>
                <p>Then Bill also asked me at another point to go out and address a labor conference
                    in Tunisia. I was to be the AF representative. This also interrupted my
                    promotion panel duties.</p>
                <p>I finished the promotion panel after three months and went to see Roy Atherton
                    who was still head of NEA. He said, “Well, there are two or three
                    ambassadorships probably coming up in the Middle East, so things are looking
                    up.” I said, “I'll tell you want I will do. I will go and brush up on my
                    Arabic.” So I went over to FSI to meet with the head of FSI and said, “I would
                    like to brush up on my Arabic.” He said, “What is your ongoing assignment?” I
                    said, “I don't have any.” He said, “Well, we never give people Arabic training
                    unless they have an ongoing assignment.” I said, “Well, this is kind of unusual
                    and if you want to call Roy Atherton he says there might be something coming
                    up.” Anyway we worked it out, and I was tutored for a couple of months.</p>
                <p>Then Phil Habib called me and said, “Syria has opened up and all of us want you
                    to go to Syria, except for one person.” I said, “Who is that?” He said, “Warren
                    Christopher.” To this day I am not sure what the problem was between me and
                    Warren Christopher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Kissinger has his own sense of humor, do you think
                        his twitting you about the PLO was taken seriously by others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: It might have been. I may have made a mistake in my modus operandi with
                    Christopher. Christopher would call me and ask me to do something and I did. But
                    not wanting to bother him, I would call his staff assistant and say, “Please let
                    the Secretary know that I have done this.” I have a feeling that he didn't let
                    the Secretary know and Christopher may have wondered why he never had a report
                    of what I had done. Then we had a difference over how to respond to human rights
                    frustrations in Ethiopia. Then, he is very short and I am very tall. I don't
                    know exactly what the problem was.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Anyway, Habib said, “You have to do something about it.” I replied, “I'm supposed
                    to do something about it? What can I do about it?” “Well, just go around and
                    talk to people.” So I said to Phil, “Who is on the committee that makes these
                    recommendations to the White House?” So he identified all the people—the
                    assistant secretary for NEA, the under secretary for administration, the
                    director general of the Foreign Service, etc. So I checked around and found
                    that, as Phil said, everybody thought I would be the ideal person for Syria, but
                    that Christopher had reservations. So what could I do but sit and wait.</p>
                <p>The story that came back to me was that when they met they all supported me for
                    the position, at which point Christopher said, “Well, with that kind of support,
                    I withdraw my reservations and will send his name up.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your collision with Christopher over human rights
                        in Ethiopia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, what happened was that when Haile Selassie was shunted aside in
                    1976, Mengistu took over. He was a Marxist and close to the Soviets and brought
                    in Cuban troops. We had had a major economic program and we discontinued it. I
                    endorsed that. However, the World Bank also had programs that might be
                    characterized as humanitarian programs, which were for the Ethiopian people. I
                    felt that these programs should continue because these were people who would
                    suffer if they didn't have aid. I can't remember the nature of that aid. I
                    argued that we should allow this kind of support to continue. Christopher said
                    that Ethiopia was in terrible violation of human rights and no one should be
                    allowed to help them including the World Bank. We were on the board and could
                    veto it. I argued that we shouldn't veto it, we should allow it to happen. Well,
                    finally he backed off and decided we would abstain and the World Bank went ahead
                    with the assistance. I think he thought as a leftover from the Kissinger regime,
                    I was somehow not sufficiently imbued with the human rights consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking that this might be a good place to stop. So

                <p>SEELYE: I went to Syria in August, 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out to Syria what were your instructions and
                        your mental list of things you wanted to do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The only item that I was instructed to raise with the Syrian government
                    concerned Syrian Jews. The background was that there was a great deal of concern
                    on the part of American Jewish politicians regarding the status of the small
                    Jewish community in Syria—added up to about 4,000, mainly in Damascus. The
                    American Jews were not entirely up-to-date on the situation because when Assad
                    came to power in 1970, he eliminated various discriminatory measures that had
                    been imposed on the Syrian Jews. There had been a prohibition from moving from
                    point A to point B without government permission; they could not attend the
                    university, etc. Assad eliminated all those proscriptions with the exception of
                    one. That was that the Jews could not emigrate from Syria. A Jewish businessman
                    could go outside on business provided he posted a bond to make sure he would
                    come back.</p>
                <p>But nevertheless there was quite a lot of concern here. One of the special issues
                    was the fact that young Jewish Syrian women could not find a Jewish man to
                    marry. So Assad made a special concession during the honeymoon period after
                    Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy and the resumption of relations. He allowed about
                    a dozen of these Jewish women to come to the United States, mainly to Brooklyn
                    because there are many Syrian Jews there, for the purpose of getting married.
                    There was a desire on the part of the congressman from Brooklyn and others that
                    more of these women be allowed to go to the United States.</p>
                <p>So my instructions were to raise this issue with Assad when I first saw him. I
                    was not instructed to raise any other issue, which I thought was quite a
                    distortion of priorities in the Middle East context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You, as Ambassador, know what the issues are when you go
                        out. I am sure there are water issues, relations with Israel and Lebanon,
                        etc. One can think of a whole series of things. Did you have your own
                        agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Being an old Middle East hand and having handled Syrian affairs among
                    other things in the late sixties and early seventies, I was pretty aware of what
                    the issues were. And people in NEA and the Department knew that I knew as much
                    about that as anybody else in the Service. So I guess they didn't feel it was
                    necessary to give me briefings or guidance on those basic issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>What were those issues? Well, quite clearly, one of the problems was that the
                    Syrian-American relationship at that point was cooling. It had reached a kind of
                    peak just after the resumption of relations in 1974. Then Ambassador Richard
                    Murphy was seeing Assad more than an ambassador normally would because it was
                    just after the first disengagement agreement negotiated between Syria and
                    Israel. There was a second disengagement agreement proposed between Syria and
                    Israel but Assad decided to refuse that particular initiative (although the
                    parallel initiative did proceed between Syria and Egypt) because he felt that at
                    that point Kissinger was just chipping away at the problem. It was piece by
                    piece, in an effort to tranquilize the situation in the Middle East. Through the
                    first disengagement agreement Assad was able to get a little territory back from
                    the Israelis, such as the town Quanaytrah on the Golan Heights. But he wasn't
                    going to get much more back because the Israelis were well entrenched on the
                    Golan Heights and he sensed at that point that Kissinger wasn't really
                    interested in a comprehensive agreement. He was just moving slowly and wanted to
                    tranquilize the situation. So Assad decided he wasn't going to buy any more of
                    this.</p>
                <p>That was the beginning of the deterioration of the relationship. It began to move
                    back to what it had been before 1974 when relations were frozen after the 1967
                    war. So I knew that I was arriving at a difficult time. As I recall, I don't
                    remember exactly, I think at that point talks were going on at Camp David and I
                    realized once those talks were completed and there was a separate peace
                    agreement between Egypt and Israel Assad would be antagonized. So I was aware of
                    the challenge of going out to a country where relations were cooling and where
                    the challenge was to establish some kind of personal rapport with key officials
                    to overcome the official coolness in the relationship. And this was what I
                    devoted my efforts to doing.</p>
                <p>So when I arrived, I dutifully did raise the matter of the question of the Syrian
                    Jews to President Assad when I presented my credentials. You have a period of
                    small talk after the formal ceremony, but he didn't respond, he just listened. I
                    knew I was doing it pro forma and I think he knew I was doing it pro forma. And,
                    of course, we did discuss other things. But that was the only point that I
                    raised at the request of Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Syria when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Of course Assad had been in power there for 8 years. It was a
                    dictatorship. The economy was not doing too well, it was socialized. You had the
                    Baath Party, which was entrenched in the civil service of the government with a
                    socialist, Marxist mind-set. Many of the officials had been trained in Eastern
                    Europe or in the Soviet Union because those were the only free scholarships that
                    were given to Syrians in that period. So they had, of course, blinders on and
                    were very ideological. At the same time the main issue as it evolved between the
                    United States and Syria was Lebanon of the potential there for a Syrian-Israeli
                    confrontation. In 1976 Syria had entered Lebanon in order to keep the civil war
                    from blowing up even more. And it did so with our blessing because at that point
                    the Christian Maronite faction in Lebanon was in the process of being overrun by
                    a combination of militia composed of the Muslim militia, Communist militia,
                    Druze militia, Palestinian militia, etc. They formed a coalition and were
                    winning the battles on the ground. Syria has always had an interest in Lebanon
                    because Lebanon was carved out of Syria by the French back in the twenties, and
                    Syria has never forgotten that. In fact, Syria has never had diplomatic
                    relations with Lebanon, it has felt that the two countries are one and the same
                    territories. In 1976 Syria decided that it was in its interest to keep the
                    Maronites from collapsing because it felt that the way to maintain relative
                    stability in Lebanon was through a balance of forces. Syria recognized that the
                    weakest force in Lebanon at this point was the Maronites, so it went in to save
                    their necks.</p>
                <p>There may also have been an element of minority sympathies. The Maronites had
                    become a minority in Lebanon. The Alawite leadership in Syria is a 12 percent
                    minority and sometimes minorities feel that they can do better if they hang
                    together against the majority.</p>
                <p>So the Syrians were in. In the process we negotiated behind the scenes a
                    so-called red-line agreement whereby the Syrians would not go further south than
                    a so-called red line drawn some ten or twelve miles or so north of the
                    Lebanese-Israeli border. This enabled Israel to waive objection to the Syrian
                    entry.</p>
                <p>So the Syrians went in and it was at the request of the Lebanese government,
                    which was worried about the situation, and the Syrians restored the equilibrium.
                    Later on, of course, they were to get behind the opposition coalition in order
                    to prevent an imbalance in favor of the Maronites.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>As I arrived in Syria, almost immediately things were beginning to blow up in
                    Lebanon. There was a civil war there and every now and then the threat of an
                    Israeli-Syrian confrontation. I realized that one of my primary assignments was
                    to get the United States to serve as a middle man to prevent things from getting
                    out of hand. During my first week in Damascus, as I recall, I was involved in
                    talks with the Syrian foreign minister and others in an effort to defuse the
                    situation. It looked as if the Syrians and Israelis might be drawn into a clash
                    over some incident in Lebanon. And that became really the primary focus of my
                    contacts with the Syrians. In fact Lebanon was so much on the front burner of
                    our relations with Syria that I, as American Ambassador in Syria, saw more of
                    the foreign minister, more of Syrian officials concerned with foreign policy
                    than any other ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing mainly with the foreign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, I would see the foreign minister when I had to make an important
                    demarche or important presentation, but I developed a day-to-day relationship
                    with the deputy foreign minister, who happened to be a very congenial person who
                    was well regarded in the system and by the President. He was a member of the
                    establishment and yet he had a kind of empathy and willingness to see me and we
                    developed a good personal relationship. That kind of saved the day, because if
                    something happened in the middle of the night, as it often did in that part of
                    the world, I could call him—he had given me his home telephone number—and try to
                    work things out.</p>
                <p>So that was the main personal relationship that I established that helped,
                    particularly in the Lebanese context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To burrow in a little more, when you say you called him at
                        night and whatever, and worked things out, can you give an idea of how one
                        works things out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I am trying to remember now. There was one incident, for example, when
                    the Israelis came into Lebanon quite far and shot down some Syrian helicopters
                    because the Israelis felt that somehow their clients, the Maronites, were being
                    threatened by Syrian helicopters operating in Lebanon. So the Israelis shot down
                    these helicopters deep into Lebanon. The Syrians then moved some SAM missiles
                    located along the border onto the Lebanese side of the border. My task was to
                    try to defuse the situation. My counterpart in Israel, Sam Lewis, was doing the
                    same thing. We didn't want this thing to blow up. For my part I was trying to
                    get the Syrians to pull their SAM missiles back. This sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would describe this to him and then he would go back
                        and talk with the foreign minister or somebody like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it during this time, it is very difficult to
                        me. Here is two nations essentially still in a state of war, Syria and
                        Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the actual facts of the
                        matter? How did you find the Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: There was a lot of misunderstanding, I think, about the Syrian position.
                    Assad had in response to the initiatives taken by the U.S. in 1973-74 finally
                    agreed to this basic Security Council Resolution 242, which was then
                    supplemented by 338 (which was a reaffirmation of 242 in the context of the 1973
                    war) calling for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories, meaning the
                    West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights, in return for an Arab undertaking to
                    make peace with Israel. Assad had not signed onto the Resolution in 1967, but he
                    did agree to it in 1974. Thus, in 1974 he agreed to the principle of peace in
                    return for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights. People often ignore that.
                    While I was there it was reported to me that European foreign ministers would
                    discuss some of the modalities of a peace agreement with the Syrians. For
                    example, Syrian officials agreed informally in these meetings to some kind of
                    peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights in return for peace. This was way back
                    in the late seventies.</p>
                <p>But this was not clear to others because the Syrian media was so bombastic, which
                    is so true in that part of the world where often rhetoric bears little
                    resemblance to reality. The Syrian press, TV and radio were always blasting
                    Israel and the United States and calling us enemies, etc. Yet, quietly the
                    Syrians were briefing people and saying that if Israel withdraws from the Golan
                    Heights we might work out a deal. But all people outside Syria heard was the
                    rhetoric. I had the task of trying to make clear to Washington that they
                    shouldn't be taken in by this rhetoric. For example, the Minister of Defense,
                    Mustafatlas, who was not a very rational person, liked to shoot his mouth off
                    and make wild statements. Washington would get quite upset. I tried to point out
                    that this was pure rhetoric and in any case he didn't speak for Assad. He was
                    going off on his own.</p>
                <p>So, it was difficult to make people understand that Syrian policy was not as
                    represented by the media rhetoric</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the media rhetoric, did you have Western,
                        particularly American, news media TV or newspapers? And could you sort of
                        make the point that you just made to me about the bombast, because these are
                        people familiar with the area anyway and did this seem to translate into
                        realistic reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Occasionally, but we didn't have very many Western reporters coming in.
                    But once they got there they understood this phenomenon and would report
                    accurately. Occasionally the AP correspondent came across from Beirut. Sometimes
                    journalists would come in the hope of getting an interview with Assad. So there
                    would occasionally be items on Syria that would appear in the United States that
                    would be balanced. But they wouldn't be picked up by everybody and would be
                    overwhelmed by the daily FBIS-kind of reports that quoted the Syrian
                    rhetoric.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about visiting congressmen, did you have any
                        visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: we had a couple. I had been there only a few weeks when Congressman
                    Solarz came to check into the plight of Syrian Jews. He is from Brooklyn and, as
                    I indicated earlier, most Syrian Jews living in the United States live in
                    Brooklyn. So he came to ascertain the situation. We took him around to see
                    officials, and he met with the Jewish leaders in Damascus. Then he asked to see
                    a representative from the Jewish community up in Qamishli, in the northwest near
                    the border with Turkey. They drove down all night but he never saw them. He sent
                    a sidekick to see them, which made me conclude that Mr. Solarz was more
                    interested in being able to go back and tell his constituents that he had met
                    with everyone and he didn't really care whether he had met with them or not.
                    Very much a politician, obviously. After having, I thought, briefed him pretty
                    well and exposing him to this and that, I remember at the last breakfast we had
                    (he was there about three days) he said, “I don't think that the Palestinian
                    question is relevant to a resolution of the Arab-Israeli problem.” He turned out
                    to be a bit of a headache. He wanted to ship rugs back through the diplomatic
                    pouch, which, of course, is illegal. I don't think I gave him permission to do
                    that, although my wife said that I did. Then he was caught driving into Lebanon
                    with too much currency or something and was held for a while. So I didn't get
                    the impression that Mr. Solarz was the most upstanding individual. I had had a
                    run in with him once before. I think I mentioned it earlier on, or had I
                    mentioned it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure, but you might mention it to be
                        certain.</hi>

                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I had been deputy assistant secretary for African Affairs a year before
                    that and my boss was away quite often so I was acting assistant secretary and
                    had gone up to the Hill to testify on aid to Southern Africa. I had finished my
                    presentation to the Subcommittee on Africa, headed by Congressman Diggs. I
                    noticed on the raised dais, where the congressmen sit and look down upon you
                    imposingly, that the seat was empty behind the name plate of Congressman Solarz.
                    I had finished my presentation, I had been there about 25 minutes, and in he
                    walked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did mention that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Okay, so I mentioned that. I challenged him and he asked me a question
                    and somehow I reacted negatively to the way he asked it and said, “Well,
                    Congressman Solarz, if you had been here on time you would have heard my answer,
                    I have already answered that question.” Then he was defensive and said, “Well, I
                    was at the White House, etc.”</p>
                <p>So, he came to Damascus and concluded that the Palestinian issue is irrelevant
                    and probably thought that I was not pushing the Jewish question enough. And to
                    jump ahead a bit but to continue this theme, this thread, a year or two later I
                    was told by Washington that Solarz had put before the Hill, Congress, a proposed
                    resolution condemning the Syrians for not allowing all the Jews to leave Syria,
                    and what did I think of it? I wrote a cable back and said, “Well, the Syrians
                    have been unresponsive so far to this request to allow more Jews to leave, but
                    there is always a possibility they might do so and we are working on it. If this
                    resolution is submitted to Congress, it will obviously ruin any chance at all of
                    the Syrians releasing any more girls. So I don't think the resolution a good
                    idea.” I sent this cable EXDIS/STADIS, which meant it would go to NEA only,
                    limited distribution. Then I added gratuitously, which of course was kind of
                    stupid of me, and this came about because of my feelings about Congressman
                    Solarz, obviously, “However, if Congressman Solarz wants to put this resolution
                    before Congress just because of domestic/political considerations, that's not
                    for me to answer.” That message was passed to the Jewish representative. You
                    know we have a Jewish representative all the time in the White House, somebody
                    to defend American-Jewish interests. He also has an office in the State
                    Department. This was Mr. Sanders. Despite the limited distribution somebody sent
                    this cable to Mr. Sanders and he sent it to Congressman Solarz, who blew his
                    stack and called Secretary Vance and said something like, “Get Seelye out of
                    there.” I am not sure what Secretary Vance said, maybe something like, “How did
                    you get ahold of the cable?”</p>
                <p>So those were my associations with Congressmen Solarz. He was only one of two
                    Congressional delegations that came. The other congressman who came was another
                    New York congressman but he was not representing his district but representing
                    some United Nations organization. AID was sponsoring him because his mission, as
                    I recall, had to do with population control or something like that. The first
                    night he asked the AID control officer to get him a woman.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>So those were the only two congressmen I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little footnote. Right now as we talk Congressman Solarz
                        has lost an election in Brooklyn. It went Hispanic. He has been nominated to
                        be ambassador to India, but the whole thing has been held up because
                        apparently his income tax situation isn't exactly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: There were a lot of things. It has finally been approved, by the way,
                    although it was held up for a long time. Other problems were that he apparently
                    sponsored a Hong Kong businessman with a criminal record, got him into this
                    country. Then he was the worst offender on the House with regard to overdrawing
                    their accounts. I think all of these things probably delayed his appointment,
                    but he has now been approved by the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Assad before you went there,
                        it dealing with him and also any differences in how you analyzed him and how
                        others did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I had been in charge of what we call Arabian North Affairs in the
                    Department which included Syria back in 1968-72, when Assad came to power, so I
                    followed him very closely. However, I had never met him before. I think when one
                    meets him you see an additional dimension to Assad. If one hears about him from
                    afar he comes across as a tough guy, shrewd, very adroit, who runs Syria with an
                    armed fist. But when you meet him personally, as I did for the first time when I
                    presented my credentials, you found a man very at ease, very laid back, very
                    pleasant with a nice smile on his face, very responsive, with the appearance of
                    having lots of time, a good sense of humor, a very attractive personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not dour? Somehow dour has always struck me as the
                        operative term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, he isn't that way at all. Just very low key and laid back, responsive
                    and curious and bright. So that is what one learns by meeting him firsthand. I
                    had the impression before I got there that there was a difference between him
                    and Saddam. I had also followed Saddam Hussein closely because he came to power
                    in Iraq about the same time, although at first he was the power behind the
                    scenes. When Saddam came to power in Iraq I became aware of his ruthlessness.
                    How he wiped out the intellectual elite of Baghdad and how bloody-minded and
                    basically how brutal a person he was. I had felt that Assad was much more
                    calculating and much more discriminating when it came to the use of force and
                    terror. And that was borne out when I was there. If the regime was challenged,
                    Assad was ruthless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was this revolt in Hama...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>SEELYE: That happened after I left, but it was building up while I was there
                    because the Moslem Brotherhood was beginning to get up a head of steam while I
                    was there. We could hear explosions right near the embassy resulting from an
                    attack by some gang of the Moslem Brotherhood against some Baathist office or
                    residence. We had reports that the Brotherhood was getting stronger,
                    particularly up in the Hama, which has always been a bastion of Islamic
                    conservatism. A couple of times even Soviet military advisers were attacked. In
                    Damascus members of the Mulchbarat (Security Service) which drove around in land
                    rovers. Whenever you saw a land rover you knew it was the Mulchbarat, except
                    that the Soviet advisers also drove land rovers. A total of 12 Soviet military
                    advisers were killed in the course of time, either because the Brotherhood
                    thought they were Mulchbarat or maybe because they knew they were Russians and
                    felt that since the Russians were close to Assad they were legitimate targets. I
                    used to joke privately that here was the American Ambassador who is representing
                    a country that was not enjoying good relations, and yet I didn't feel really in
                    danger. Although there was an incident once that indicated that this was not
                    always the case. But here were the Russians who were close to Syria and got shot
                    at and some were killed.</p>
                <p>The Moslem Brotherhood movement was gaining strength and at first Assad tried to
                    cut a deal with them. At the same time he threw a lot of them in jail, those he
                    could get his hands on. But the situation still got worse. Up in Aleppo at one
                    point, while cadets in the cadet academy were in an auditorium, ninety were
                    killed by machine guns fired through the windows. The Brotherhood was considered
                    responsible and there was some evidence that Iraq was colluding with the
                    organization. In the fall of 1978, just after I got there, there was an effort
                    to bring Iraq and Syria together and they met in Damascus, with the idea of
                    unity. But it fell apart, it didn't work out. As months went by tensions
                    increased between the two countries. And the Syrians claimed to have evidence
                    that the Iraqis were helping the Brotherhood, providing them with arms, and were
                    behind some of these incidents like the cadet massacre. So things were building
                    up. At one point the Syrian government decided to teach the Brotherhood a
                    lesson. There is a big prison up near Palmyra and a lot of the prisoners there
                    were political prisoners, many who were members of the Brotherhood or suspected
                    of being so. They were let out as if they were going to be freed, several
                    hundred of them. Then with helicopters and armored cars the Syrian police and
                    military just mowed them down.</p>
                <p>One was aware of the bestiality in Assad, but it was not quite to the same degree
                    as in the case of Saddam. Saddam did it every day. Assad did it only when he
                    felt challenged. He felt challenged by this group and wanted to teach them a
                    lesson. Well, of course, that affair in Palmyra only incensed the Brotherhood
                    even more. The uprising in Hama occurred after I left, in 1982. The Brotherhood
                    in Hama rose up against the government and killed Assad's officials in Hama. So
                    the government decided that this was the last straw. It sent in elite troops who
                    just wiped out half the city and killed 15,000-20,000 people, men, women and
                    children. This was ruthless, but there hasn't been a peep out of the Brotherhood
                    ever since in the last twelve years. That is Assad's modus operandi.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Assad understood the dynamics of
                        American policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Not entirely. He was kind of isolated, had limited exposure to the
                    outside world. He had gone to the cadet academy and had been a pilot. He had
                    brief training in England, after he had become a pilot, for maybe six months. He
                    may have visited a few other Arab countries, but he was pretty much isolated
                    from the outside world. But he had an insatiable curiosity to learn. Whenever
                    important visitors came he was always asking very leading questions about this
                    and that. So he was learning. I think he read a lot. So he began to become a
                    little more aware of realities, but he still had gaps, no question about it.</p>
                <p>I remember one time when I was with him he claimed that the United States had
                    been involved in one of the Brotherhood's actions in Syria. I said, “Well, Mr.
                    President, I can tell you categorically that we were not.” He smiled and said,
                    “Well, we have evidence.” I said, “I would like to see the evidence.” And then I
                    tried to figure out what he was talking about and it turned out that the
                    Brotherhood in Jordan had been involved in helping the Syrian Brotherhood with
                    arms and other political support and King Hussein had looked the other way. In
                    fact, he may not have known the extent of the support because it was
                    orchestrated by some of his own security people. And I supposed that Assad
                    assumed that if the Jordanians were involved, therefore ipso facto the U.S.,
                    being close to Jordan, was involved. And that was the kind of feeling he had
                    about Israeli actions. If Israel did something against the Arabs the United
                    States was implicated because it was felt that Israel operated only with U.S.
                    permission. This was a reflection of his naivet� and his insularity. He thought
                    that if Jordan did something, obviously it had to be done with the approval, if
                    not the participation, of the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say his mind-set was that of the United States
                        manipulating Israel rather than, as I think most of us feel, Israel being
                        the tail wagging the American dog?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I don't necessarily think he thought the United States was manipulating
                    Israel, but he thought any Israeli action was done with the approval of the
                    United States, if not the active collaboration.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>People forget that he was really scared to death of Israel. By the time I got
                    there (after the 1973 war) the Israelis had not only taken back the Golan
                    Heights in 1967, they had taken more territory and they were on the down side
                    overlooking Damascus. So they were within range of Damascus. Assad knew the
                    quality of the Israeli forces, how strong they were. Qualitatively they were
                    stronger than his army, although Assad had a larger military force. So he was
                    very careful to eschew any military confrontation. Occasionally he would bluff,
                    as I mentioned with the incident with the missiles, and maybe at some point he
                    would have been willing to risk everything for honor but basically he was very
                    careful not to antagonize or draw the Israelis into a war because he knew he
                    would get badly beaten. He was concerned by the threat from Israel. He would
                    hear the warlord types like Sharon beating the drums and advocating taking out
                    Syria. And, of course, this is the reason he tried to get as much in the way of
                    arms from the Soviet Union as he could. In fact, there was one point when he
                    tried to get the Soviets, themselves, to commit themselves to bringing in combat
                    troops. The Soviet troops there were military advisers. After I left, when the
                    situation in Lebanon blew and the U.S. was involved with the marines, etc., the
                    Soviets did at one point agree to man some of the surface-to-air missiles in
                    Syria. That was the furthest they ever went to getting involved in potential
                    combat. But Assad tried to drag the Soviets in because he was afraid he wouldn't
                    be able to match Israel if Syria got into a war. He was trying to achieve
                    military parity with Israel. This was kind of naive because he must have been
                    aware, subconsciously at least, that the United States was never going to allow
                    Israel ever to be militarily inferior to Syria or to any other Arab country. But
                    nevertheless this was the line he took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Soviets there as we saw it at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>SEELYE: The Soviets had a military training mission, quite large, several
                    thousand men. The Eastern Europeans were helping them with their security
                    service. They had some economic aid from Eastern Europe and the Russians. The
                    Russians were very generous about their arms supplies. For a long time the
                    Syrians didn't pay in cash. There was a barter arrangement, but, of course, the
                    Syrians could never barter enough goods to pay for the arms. They are still in
                    tremendous debt to the Russians. And yet, Assad carefully restricted the
                    Communist party in Syria. He formed a Progressive Front composed of five
                    parties, which was really nothing more than just a show because the only
                    important party was the Baath party. But he pretended to have a little more
                    pluralism by having the five parties of the Progressive Front, of which one was
                    the Communist party. But the Communists weren't even allowed to publish a
                    newspaper. So on the one hand he tightly controlled the Communists within Syria
                    and on the other hand he paid absolutely no attention to Soviet advice and
                    counsel in regard to foreign policy. Constantly the Soviets were tearing their
                    hair over policy moves by Assad. For example, they were never happy with Syria's
                    moving into Lebanon. They thought that was self-defeating and would weaken him
                    and hurt him. They were very upset one time when Assad was quite mad at the
                    Jordanians and some of the other Arabs who were having a summit in Amman. This
                    must have been about the fall of 1980, and he decided to make a show of force.
                    He sent a division down to the Jordanian border. I knew it was a bluff. He was
                    just trying to make the point that he was not happy with the summit's decisions.
                    He was at odds with Jordan and some of the other Arab countries at that point.
                    The Soviets were quite upset because just before that Assad had signed the
                    Soviet-Syrian Friendship Treaty, which according to the text of the treaty
                    requires mutual consultation before and certainly after any military move. Not
                    only did Assad not tell the Soviets before he moved his troops, he didn't tell
                    them about it after he did it. Then the Soviets were upset with the fact that
                    Assad had gotten involved supporting Iran against Iraq. The Soviets knew this
                    took them out of the Arab mainstream and isolated him. They were also upset
                    because he rejected Arafat. He had a running feud with Arafat. Other Arab states
                    felt Arafat was the legitimate head of the Palestinians and were helping Arafat
                    with arms and money. The Soviets felt the Syrians were making a mistake in
                    opposing Arafat.</p>
                <p>Assad, to my knowledge, only once ever responded to Soviet policy desires in
                    foreign policy and that was when he was the only Arab state to support the
                    Soviets on Afghanistan. He could afford to do that because it had no bearing on
                    the immediate Middle East situation confronting him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happened in December, 1979...at least the Soviets
                        brought their troops in and invaded Afghanistan then...were you there at

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes.</p>

                <p>SEELYE: No, I don't remember doing that. Maybe I did, I can't remember. We used
                    to get instructions from IO, as you know, all the time on all kinds of
                    international issues. We would get instructions to intervene on every imaginable
                    issue. We would go in pro forma at the level of the desk officer and make a
                    protest and everybody knew it was pro forma. Of course Afghanistan was
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was number one on our agenda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: But Assad didn't supply any substantive support and I don't remember him
                    making a big issue out of it. He did it very quietly. Maybe the U.S. didn't even
                    know about it at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were into the Carter period when you went out.
                        Kissinger had been on the shuttle diplomacy. Did Assad ever talk about his
                        friend Henry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, he never did in my presence. Just after the Kissinger initiative he
                    had met with Carter in Geneva, about a year before I got to Damascus when Dick
                    Murphy was there. Assad never mentioned that to me but I heard that he was happy
                    with the meeting with Carter but disappointed with the results. He thought that
                    Carter was going to solve the Palestine questions. One of the signs of Assad's
                    naivet� on international affairs, or maybe he just took this position, I don't
                    know, was that he assumed that when the U.S. said, “We are going to try to do
                    this or work with Israel and hope to achieve this,” he thought we had committed
                    ourselves. For example, at one time Phil Habib was called into action as
                    negotiator on Lebanon after the Israelis had invaded in 1982 and went all the
                    way to Beirut. Phil Habib was negotiating a disengagement agreement involving an
                    Israeli withdrawal. The Syrians agreed to the cease fire that Habib negotiated,
                    on the basis that they said they thought that this was an undertaking that
                    Israel would withdraw from Lebanon. I am sure nobody like Habib could guarantee
                    another country's doing something. You can't guarantee the action of another
                    country. All he could say was, “Well, the Israelis have undertaken to withdraw
                    and we are going to put their feet to the fire.” Well, as we know they didn't
                    withdraw all the way, they hung on to twelve miles of Lebanese territory. And
                    Assad felt he had been diddled by us as a result. Once again he thought that the
                    U.S. could have just told Israel to withdraw. So this was one basis for
                    misunderstandings between U.S. and Syria, because Assad felt we could do things
                    that we couldn't do. Israel called more shots in Washington than we called in
                    Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a mind-set within the State Department at that
                        time that you felt was different than your appreciation on the scene of
                        Assad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I didn't feel that there was any difference between me and the desk, for
                    example. Morris Draper, who was in charge of the North Arabian Affairs,
                    certainly understood fully. I felt the State Department understood. But the
                    people at the top I'm sure weren't aware of the situation. They were always
                    getting delegations from Congress telling them how terrible Syria was. The Camp
                    David Agreement was finally signed just after I got there and that, of course,
                    didn't help things. Assad was furious that Sadat had gone off on his own. He
                    felt that the only way that Syria could get any concessions from Israel was if
                    the Arabs moved in tandem and all got concessions together. He now felt isolated
                    and that pressure on Israel to make concessions to Syria in a peace agreement
                    was alleviated. Assad felt he had lost a bargaining chip. So he was very upset.
                    I remember Vance came to Damascus after the Camp David Agreement was signed.
                    Assad was very polite to Vance. He is always very polite. I had a sense that
                    Vance kind of understood Assad. At one point Assad raised the Palestinian
                    question and Vance went so far as to say that some day there would be a
                    Palestinian state and we would support it.</p>
                <p>I got the impression that some people in Washington were often taken in by the
                    Syrian rhetoric. For example, when Assad mobilized his troops on the Syrian
                    border much earlier, I knew it was a bluff. You can ask me how did I know it was
                    a bluff and I guess it was just intuition. If you are in an area long enough you
                    have a sixth sense about things. But my colleague in Amman didn't know this was
                    a bluff and he sent NIACT messages to Washington urging that the U.S. provide a
                    special military show of force for King Hussein to deter Assad from invading.
                    Washington got kind of taken in by some of those cables. I was crying in the
                    wilderness. I loved King Hussein too, I had handled Jordanian affairs, etc., but
                    the realities were that Assad was not going to go into Jordan. If we identify
                    too closely militarily with a close friend like Hussein, it only stigmatizes
                    this friend in the eyes of his adversaries. Washington may have thought that my
                    assessment was the result of being an Arabist and being too pro-Syrian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out? Did we get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, Assad removed his troops. We may have made some token gestures, but
                    I have forgotten what they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the ambassadors, here you had Jordan, Israel
                        and Lebanon being key players sitting there, and at that time we really
                        didn't have much representation in Iraq, did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: We had an interest section there but it was just hanging on my its
                    fingernails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all reporting and seeing the world the same
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>SEELYE: No. I and Sam Lewis, in Tel Aviv, were not. He would occasionally send
                    cables saying that the Israelis were very upset because the Syrians were
                    mobilizing. I would cable saying that the Syrians were only involved in
                    maneuvers, which was true. At one point the second Middle East negotiator after
                    Strauss was due to come out to the area, but at the last minute he said he
                    couldn't come to the area and would meet us in Rome or Paris. He asked the three
                    of us ambassadors from Israel, Jordan and Syria to go up there. I said to Sam,
                    “Lets get together and try to iron things out so we all will understand what the
                    Syrians are really up to.” Actually the meeting was canceled, but Sam and I met
                    in Paris anyway. We had dinner together and I tried to point out to Sam that
                    what I was saying was accurate, the Syrians bluffed a lot, etc. But I think Sam
                    felt I was probably too pro-Syrian. I certainly felt he was too pro-Israeli, so
                    there we are.</p>
                <p>I had very good relations with Nick Veliotes in Jordan, but Nick, not being a
                    Middle Eastern hand, also didn't quite understand Syria. I was amused by the
                    fact that he would not allow his people to visit Damascus because he heard about
                    these occasional bombings by the Brotherhood and all. Well, my wife was going
                    down to the souk everyday. We weren't worried. I tried to point out to Nick that
                    Damascus was a delightful city to visit in contrast to Amman which has little to
                    offer a tourist and he should let his people come. He never would. So he was
                    very cautious about that. I think it was wrong, but that was his judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, too, I think something like that will cause a
                        feeling within an embassy. If you can't go to a place it assumes proportions
                        that don't help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: With regard to Beirut, the Ambassador there was John Gunther Dean most of
                    the time I was there. I thought he did a very good job. What impressed me was he
                    arrived without any background on Lebanon and there is always the danger that a
                    newcomer to Lebanon, getting caught up in the Maronite social set, would get a
                    kind of jaundiced view of things. But Dean maintained his balance very well. We
                    would meet occasionally at Chtawa, which was on the border, to compare notes.
                    But John did all the talking and I rarely got a word in so these meetings proved
                    unproductive, as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Camp David was pretty much a done deal by the time you got
                        there, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Oh, yes, the Syrians were very upset about it. I had, of course, to go in
                    to the Foreign Ministry and defend the agreement and I did my best to point out
                    the positive aspects of it. But the Syrians were very unhappy with it, Assad
                    particularly. That cooled our relationship even more. Of course, Mr. Kaplan in
                    his book on Arabists totally distorted my position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about an author called Robert Kaplan who
                        wrote a book recently on the Arabist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: And Kaplan claimed that I opposed the Camp David Agreement and that I
                    left the Foreign Service because of my opposition to it, which was, of course,
                    ridiculous. I have had a long correspondence with him and finally after having
                    sent him a clipping from an AP report on my exit interview from Damascus I was
                    able to get him to concede the fact that what I said was not that I opposed the
                    Camp David Agreement per se, but that what I said was, and this was two years
                    after the Camp David Agreement had already been signed, that in ongoing peace
                    negotiations as they occurred, if and when, we should not use the Camp David
                    label because it had become a red flag in all Arab countries, except Egypt, and
                    it would be better just to use a different context. I didn't mean to say that we
                    should not follow the formula of proposing exchange territory for peace or
                    anything like that, but that there should be a label to these talks that avoided
                    reference to Camp David. Kaplan finally conceded that he was wrong, but it is
                    too late. That is in the book and it makes me look foolish. In any case, how can
                    a person resign over Camp David when it was two years after the agreement was
                    signed?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your embassy at that time, as a team and
                        all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I think it was a pretty good team. It was a small embassy and we
                    therefore had a lot of interchange. We had a meeting every morning with the key
                    members of the country team. One day a week we had a larger meeting of all
                    officers. I think I was satisfied with the caliber of the people there. We had
                    one Arabist, who was the DCM, who was an expert in the Arab world. Our political
                    officer had worked with me in Washington. He was not an Arabist but he was a
                    good officer. The economic officer was really terrific. He was an Arabist and a
                    great outside man. In the Foreign Service you have some people who are good
                    inside and some who are good outside, some are both. Some are good at writing
                    reports and research and not too good at going out and talking to people and
                    picking up information. This economic officer was a great outside man. He would
                    be out there with the business people and all and pick up the current thinking
                    or gossip, which was useful. What are the complaints, what are the stories being
                    told about Assad, etc.? He was a great asset. His name was Pat Theros. He later
                    became DCM in Jordan and I think he is now in the Department. So I was satisfied
                    with the team.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Half way through we got a station chief who was a real gung-ho guy, maybe a
                    little too gung-ho, but very able. The military attach�s were good, I thought.
                    There wasn't much for a military attach� to do there because the Syrian military
                    refused to see him then. The exception was a liaison officer assigned to receive
                    all the military attach�s. The minister of defense wouldn't see our attach� nor
                    would the chief of staff. So all he could do was run around in his car and try
                    to see where all the troops were deployed. I remember the chief of staff, who is
                    still there, his name is Hikonat Shihaki, actually went to Fort Leavenworth's
                    Command and General Staff School, way back before the Baathists came to power.
                    He is a Sunni, incidentally. In the honeymoon period when Dick Murphy was there,
                    he would see the military attach� and Murphy could see him if necessary, but
                    after the Camp David Agreement those contacts ended. Just before I left
                    Damascus, after I had been there about three years, at some big reception I was
                    wandering around when I heard a voice say to me, “Don't you know me?” I looked
                    around and there was a guy in uniform smiling who said, “I am Hikonat Shehaki.”
                    I said, “I am glad to meet you. I've been trying to see you for three years.”
                    And he laughed.</p>
                <p>So the cold relationship inhibited my access to the military as to Baath
                    officials. But I was able to see cabinet ministers, of course. In addition to
                    the Deputy Foreign Minister, with whom I had a very good relationship, the
                    Minister of Economy, Mohamed Inadi, was a great friend in court. And he is still
                    there, by the way, as Minister of Economy. He is married to an American and has
                    a Ph.D. from Columbia. I think in a way that Assad may have quietly designated
                    him to deal with me, so to speak. More than that he had a very positive
                    inclination towards the United States and wasn't reluctant to show it to me
                    despite the environment in which he was operating. Assad, I think, thought
                    highly of him. And he was very helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I should have mentioned one other congressional visit which relates to the
                    Ministry of Economy. Senator Byrd of West Virginia came. He was out in the
                    Middle East with a White House plane on some kind of mission. Of course he
                    wanted to have an appointment with Assad fixed before he came. Well, the policy
                    in Syria is that nobody gets an appointment with the President until after
                    arrival in Damascus. Once you are there at the President's leisure he will (or
                    may) agree to an appointment. Well, Byrd wasn't very happy about this, but he
                    came. Unfortunately, just as he arrived, Assad took off for Latakia, up north.
                    So I took Byrd to see some ministers and I had a dinner for him and briefed him.
                    He was scheduled to be there for only 24 hours but he agreed to extend his visit
                    for another 24 hours if he could see Assad. So I went to see Inadi and asked,
                    “What are we going to do? The main reason Byrd came to Damascus was to see
                    Assad. He is upset because he can't see him. Byrd is very influential in the
                    Senate. He can be very influential in legislation that could affect Syria. In
                    fact it might affect you now.” At that point we had a big AID program of $100
                    million a year. I said, “This could hurt the AID program and you know how
                    important that is. What can we do?” Inadi replied, “Well, I will see what I can
                    do.” I left and he called me up later. He said, “Is there any way that Byrd can
                    extend his stay another 24 hours because I think the President will be coming
                    back tomorrow.” Byrd said, “No, I can't wait any longer, I have to go to Jeddah.
                    I have already extended my visit for a day.” So I said to the minister, “Well,
                    he just can't stay, what can we do?” And then the minister and I somehow came up
                    with the idea of having Byrd go on to Jeddah and then stop in Syria again on his
                    way out. We proposed that to Byrd and he said, “Okay. Is the meeting definite?”
                    The minister assured us it was.</p>
                <p>So Byrd came back and saw Assad. That propitiated Byrd and he had a good meeting
                    and went back happy.</p>
                <p>That was an example of how hard it was to pin down Assad. If a correspondent came
                    and wanted to have an interview with Assad I would say, “You will have to sit
                    around the hotel for a week or two before you hear anything.” In fact, the first
                    time I went back to Damascus after I left Syria, in 1984—every year I take a
                    group of oil analysts and investment managers on an orientation trip, and this
                    was our first trip to Syria—I requested an appointment with Assad. Meanwhile I
                    had lined up other meetings. I couldn't sit around waiting. Just as we were
                    leaving the Sheraton Hotel for a meeting, just by luck somebody ran out to tell
                    me that the President would see us in ten minutes. The Presidency just happened
                    to catch us. If we had gone on to our scheduled meeting we never would have seen
                    Assad. But if you are there for only three or four days and you want to see a
                    lot of people you just can't sit around waiting just to see the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the ambassador in a place as you have described, a
                        difficult environment, how did you operate? How did you run your day?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, of course, I had bodyguards. The Syrians assigned three bodyguards
                    that rotated in turns.</p>
                <p>We had a large economic aid program. This was part of the purchase of Assad
                    support for agreeing to UNSC Resolution 242, and the first disengagement
                    agreement. It amounted to $100 million a year. In addition to road building and
                    water development and electrifying the villages, we set up an English language
                    institute that would teach English to mid-level Syrian officials going to the
                    United States on participant training programs. Somebody who is with the water
                    department would go to the States for three months and visit our water
                    departments, etc. But they had to know enough English to cope and a lot of them
                    didn't. So they would study English at the institute for eight months or more.
                    So some of my time was spent on keeping up with and visiting the various
                    projects. People don't know that we electrified villages in Syria that never had
                    had electricity before.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, we had political reporting with the usual staff trying to ferret
                    out what was going on. We had some pretty good contacts. There was a local AP
                    correspondent who would come in to see me quite often. I would brainstorm a lot
                    with two or three other ambassadors. The British Ambassador was really very
                    sharp, an old Middle East hand. We used to compare notes a lot on what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>There were visitors coming in. We had a USIA program, of course. We tried to keep
                    in touch with the academic community, which was not political. I did a lot of
                    entertaining. I used to have dinner parties and try to get a mixture of business
                    and government. In those days nobody could be invited to the ambassador's
                    residence until he got approval from the Foreign Ministry. So the invitation had
                    to be stamped by the Foreign Ministry. Most everybody who got an invitation
                    would make sure that the invitation was stamped by the Foreign Ministry.
                    However, some guests said they couldn't care less. Requiring this stamp could
                    have been a disincentive for people to come, but in a sense it was an incentive
                    because if the security forces questioned them about consorting with the
                    American Ambassador, they could show the Foreign Ministry approval. So in a way
                    it was useful for them to have that.</p>
                <p>And I would also travel around the country. I tried to visit as many of the main
                    municipal centers as I could. I must say the mayors were very hospitable and
                    threw big dinners, despite the cool country-to-country relationship. Several
                    times I went up to visit archeological sites run by Americans. I remember once
                    developing a good relationship with the local mayor of a village along the
                    Euphrates. He came down to Damascus once and came to see me. I was afraid he was
                    going to get himself into trouble with the security people. Living so far from
                    Damascus he probably wasn't aware of the political dynamics of the
                    Syrian-American relationship. So I was worried. I hoped that he hadn't been
                    picked up.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>One time I was in Aleppo and I went to see the head of the Baath Party. That was
                    the only time in all my experience of 30 odd years in the Middle East that I
                    have gotten a deep freeze from an Arab. You know normally Arabs, even if they
                    are hostile to you, have a veneer of friendship and congeniality. I walked into
                    this guy's office, he looked up from his desk and gave me a look that would have
                    killed. He then returned to his papers. I stood there and asked, “May I sit
                    down?” I had about 20-30 minutes with him and he remained hostile the whole
                    time. It was good to have that experience. He showed exactly what he felt about
                    me as the American representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Syrian media? You said they were full of
                        bombast. Did you get anywhere with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, I left that pretty much to the PAO. I did see the Minister of
                    Information from time to time, and he was very outgoing. Occasionally I felt I
                    had to go to the Foreign Minister and complain. You get inured to it after a
                    while but sometimes they would make such outrageous accusations that I would
                    have to go and complain. After that massacre of the cadets that I mentioned to
                    you I went in to see the Foreign Minister and said, “Look, this is going too
                    far.” They had attributed this to the United States, publicly. He smiled and
                    said, “Don't pay any attention to it. You know this is a free press.” Well, what
                    he meant was—of course it wasn't a free press—it was not to be taken
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>One time the Minister of Information turned out to be mischievous. Jesse Jackson
                    came to town once with his wife and two other women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jesse Jackson was not a congressman but one of the leaders
                        of the black community.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>SEELYE: Jackson came out and the Minister of Information threw a luncheon for him
                    at the Orient Club, which is a club the Syrian government entertains in. But at
                    the last minute Jesse came down with a stomach ailment and he was in bed at the
                    hotel. So his wife and two other women came to the luncheon without him. It was
                    a little awkward for me because when I arrived right on time, the only other
                    person there was the PLO representative. In those days we weren't supposed to
                    deal with the PLO. I always found it very difficult to avoid these inadvertent
                    meetings. His name was Abu Mazen, who is one of the key negotiators in the
                    current talks. He was very civil and obviously I had to be very civil. After the
                    guests arrived, one of the members of the Jackson delegation came to me and
                    said, “We would like to have a picture taken of you with us for our newspaper.”
                    I said, “Since you are in Syria, why not include the Minister of Information?”
                    “Good idea.” So we are standing there waiting for the picture to be taken and
                    unbeknownst to me the Minister of Information mischievously inserts Abu Mazen to
                    his left. I am to the Minister's right. The photographer is about to snap the
                    picture and just before he does, the Minister says to me, “Look, Abu Mazen is
                    extending his hand, why don't you shake his hand?” I held back and the
                    photographer snapped a picture without a handshake. I thought, “Okay, I will
                    shake his hand now.” At that point he snapped another picture. The next day
                    there was a headline in the leading Beirut newspaper and a picture of me shaking
                    hands with the PLO representative. The headline said that the American
                    Ambassador had restored relations with the PLO. That was one of the nails in my
                    coffin. The desk claimed to understand, but I am sure they never understood
                    upstairs. I heard that the Israeli embassy complained in Washington.</p>
                <p>So, no, I didn't do much with the press because I knew it was hopeless. The press
                    was just doing what it was told to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In November, 1979, a group of radicals took over our
                        embassy in Tehran as part of the revolution. The seizure of those hostages
                        lasted for almost 444 days. How did that affect you in Damascus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: For one thing, of course, Syria had good relations with Iran. I am trying
                    to recall whether I was instructed to intercede with regards to that, I don't
                    think so. It affected us in the sense that immediately I stopped any
                    relationship with the Iranian Ambassador. I had made an official call on him
                    when I first came, but from then on I avoided him like the plague. But I don't
                    recall that there was any particular repercussion in Syria. There were Iranians
                    who used to come to Syria to visit a famous Shiite mosque and shrine outside of
                    Damascus. The fact that Syria had relations with Iran I'm sure didn't make
                    Washington very happy. It was just another negative aspect of Syrian foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Carter Administration's
                        view of Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>SEELYE: I think Carter had less of a negative attitude towards Assad because he
                    had met him in Geneva. And as I said earlier, Assad makes a very good
                    impression. We know that just recently in connection with his meeting with
                    Clinton in Geneva. Assad also impresses people with his shrewdness. Therefore, I
                    think Carter got a pretty good feeling for Assad. But I never could sense what
                    Carter really thought about Syria because even though cables came out signed
                    Carter you knew they weren't written by him or seen by him. I didn't sense that
                    Carter was focusing much on Syria, Syria's having been left out of the Camp
                    David negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Assad realistically think that they could get
                        from the Camp David meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Syria wanted, of course, the return of the Golan Heights. With Egypt's
                    making a separate deal, Syria felt the chance of getting the Golan Heights was
                    lessened. Israel would be under less pressure to make a concession to Syria at
                    that point. Egypt had been taken out of the Arabs power equation. Now the
                    biggest Arab army was neutralized. So that really worried Assad. One thing that
                    concerned others of us—and maybe Assad too, although Assad didn't care that much
                    about the Palestinian question, although he gave vocal support to Palestinian
                    aspirations—was that the Camp David Agreement didn't include the Palestinians.
                    It was intended to but it didn't work out. The Camp David Agreement made it more
                    difficult for the Palestinian aspect to be solved for the simple reason that
                    Israel would now be under less pressure to make concessions to the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a reasonable solution, at least from an
                        American point of view to the Golan Heights problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, I did. I thought UNSC Resolution 242 was a sensible basis; an
                    exchange of territory for peace. This meant the territory occupied after 1967. I
                    felt confident that if the Golan Heights was returned, Assad would be agreeable
                    to peace. Now at that point when I was there, the Syrians talked in terms of
                    non-belligerency in return for Israeli withdrawal. But I felt that Assad would
                    eventually come around to peace, which he has, of course, now. He now talks
                    about full peace for full withdrawal. But at that point he wasn't prepared to
                    publicly say that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you look at the Golan Heights, I have seen pictures
                        mainly from the Israeli side, and they do sort of loom over everything. When
                        you say return of the Golan Heights, it is very difficult to think of a
                        powerful Israel as it was then and remains, to allow somebody to be sitting
                        there and looking down on them with military equipment, were you thinking of
                        the Golan Heights without...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>SEELYE: It would be demilitarized, and there would be peacekeeping forces. Of
                    course, it really doesn't matter whether you have military on top of the Golan
                    Heights as long as there are missiles in Damascus that can reach Tel Aviv in a
                    matter of seconds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is psychological.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Of course. In any case Assad has agreed to demilitarization. He would
                    like to have both sides demilitarized in order to salve his pride. In other
                    words, he says that if you are going to demilitarize territory on my side of the
                    line then you should also demilitarize territory on the other side. But that is
                    not going to happen. So he will have to settle for the demilitarization of just
                    the Golan Heights. At the moment there is a UN force on the Heights. You would
                    have electronic equipment and that sort of thing. The Israelis say they want
                    U.S. troops stationed on the Golan but I personally don't think that would be
                    advisable.</p>

                <p>SEELYE: Oh, yes. The Israelis will tell you that. They are confident that if the
                    Syrians make an agreement they will stick to it. Assad has been very
                    conscientious in adhering to the agreement made after the 1973 war to have UN
                    troops on the Golan. Every six months he renews the agreement automatically. So
                    that doesn't seem to be at issue here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we talk about your leaving or is there any other
                        subject we should cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>SEELYE: There was an occasion that was a little bit disturbing and to this day I
                    do not know all the facts of the situation. Someday I am going to try to trace
                    the person down who may have more facts. One day, about a week before I was
                    going on home leave in June, 1980, the head of my three bodyguards contingent
                    came to me. He was a very nice person and I was glad to have them, not because
                    they were bodyguards, but because they could see exactly where I was going and
                    what I was doing—and that I wasn't up to mischief. One day he came to me and
                    said “We have been instructed to withdraw from providing you with security.
                    Please call the Ministry of Interior and find out why because I don't know why.”
                    Well, I didn't call security, of course, I called my friend the deputy foreign
                    minister. I said, “I understand the bodyguards are being withdrawn and I just
                    wondered whether this is temporary or permanent. We appreciate the fact that you
                    have been providing this service. If they are being withdrawn permanently I
                    would like to know because then I'll get some substitutes. If they are
                    temporary, I would like to know for how long.” He said, “I will look into it.”
                    That was a Monday. So temporarily my security officer took a couple of guards
                    from the residency and put them on escort duty. Tuesday came along and still no
                    answer. Wednesday, nothing. Thursday, nothing. Friday was a holiday. I didn't
                    want to keep calling him. I had called and made my point. I didn't want to seem
                    to be demanding Syrian protection. I figured the embassy could hire people, and
                    that was probably what we should do in any case.</p>
                <p>Friday we had been invited by the British Ambassador and his wife to join them
                    for lunch at one of the cafes along the Borada River along with a couple of
                    guests from London. We accepted. So we went out to this place Friday and had an
                    Arab lunch. When we returned to my car we found a car parked behind my car
                    blocking our exit. It took a while to finally get somebody to push the car out
                    of the way. That was Friday.</p>
                <p>Monday, one of my three CIA people came in and said, “My God, I was away last
                    week and while I was gone, one of my contacts wanted to see me to tell me that
                    types from the Communist Party planned to blow you up at this Borada cafe. He
                    wanted to warn me about it but he couldn't because I wasn't here. But
                    fortunately it didn't happen because they found that seated at neighboring
                    tables were senior officials of the Syrian government.” Well, I thought this was
                    a far-fetched story and thought, “Well, that can't be true.” And then I began to
                    think. The bodyguards were pulled off suddenly and there was a car blocking my
                    exit. Maybe it was true after all. Maybe the Syrians didn't want the bodyguards
                    to be killed. Maybe the idea was that if I was only wounded at the table and
                    fled to my car, I could be finished off then because my car was blocked. To this
                    day I don't know if this report is true or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if things were under such control...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>SEELYE: It puzzles me because I don't think the Syrian government would want
                    necessarily to have me killed. Yet, it would seem they knew what was planned
                    because they removed the bodyguards. This suggests that the Syrians didn't mind
                    my getting killed. It is a puzzle and I want to track down the CIA man to review
                    more details of that story once more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the bodyguards return later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, the bodyguards never returned and the Deputy Foreign Minister never
                    returned my call. So we had our own bodyguards. And I never raised it with the
                    Syrians again. Very strange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very strange. This is in an era when ambassadors were
                        being killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Yes, but not in Syria, I thought, where the government was in tight
                    control of things. Presumably they didn't want an ambassador to get killed. So
                    one is puzzled. And to blow people up at a table you must know that you are
                    going to risk a lot of innocent bystanders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unless this is designed to go after the Communists or
                        something like that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Well, maybe it wasn't the Communists, maybe it was a group that was
                    pro-Syrian and pro-Assad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it sounds like collusion or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Something. The fact that the bodyguards were pulled off and the car was
                    blocked just makes me wonder what the hell was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I left on September 30, 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: I had actually retired in January, 1981 when the Department offered 7 �
                    percent increase in pension if one retired right away. You don't have to leave
                    your job immediately. You could retire at the end of your tour. So I took
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Well, the day before I left my political officer came to me and said, “Look,
                    something needs to be said publicly about the Middle East and U.S. policy. You
                    should do this because tomorrow the AP man is coming to see you and also the
                    Washington Post representative. I planned to brief them on the usual background.
                    He urged me to take this opportunity to put some facts on the record.” I said,
                    “No, I can't do this.” At a goodbye party the night before I finally told him to
                    tell the journalists that I would speak for the record.</p>
                <p>So, I went to my office before 9:00 and they came in at 9:00. I was going to the
                    airport at 9:45. I saw them and gave my interview. I didn't say very much that
                    was world-shattering. I said, for example, when they asked if I thought we
                    should have relations with the PLO, “Yes, of course, because the PLO represents
                    the Palestinians, and to deal with the Palestinian question you have to deal
                    with the PLO.” And Begin was about to come to Washington, maybe that is why this
                    hit the fan. They asked, “What about Begin's trip?” and I said, “Well, so long
                    as Begin is Prime Minister there is no chance of having a Middle East peace
                    because he is against the basic ingredients of a peace settlement.” Those were
                    the kinds of things that I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you by any chance have a text or anything of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: No, I have a couple of press reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you could, give them to me at some point and I will put
                        one in this interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: There is an AP one and a Washington Post one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: So I flew off and our first stop was Athens. I told the Department that I
                    was going to take leave for four or five weeks in Europe. It so happened that
                    one of my ex-secretaries was there. We called her and she said, “Oh, your
                    interview has hit the fan. I'll give you a clipping.” And sure enough it had hit
                    the fan. It got international attention. I think probably because Begin was
                    about to go to Washington. So I thought, I'm retiring, so what. We went off on
                    our jaunt through Europe. Well, ABC and NBC tried to track me down, etc. We got
                    to Paris, our last stop where we were staying with Chris Chapman, the DCM. I
                    remember in the car from the airport he said, “Sadat has just been
                    assassinated.”</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>By the time that I got back to Washington I guess the dust had settled, four
                    weeks had elapsed. I came in to finalize my retirement, which took about a week
                    to ten days. The office director was Nat Howell, who gave me a goodbye party in
                    the office of Arabian North Affairs that I had headed 15 years before. And off I
                    went. That was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody huffing or puffing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: Nobody called it to my attention. I think Nick Veliotes, the assistant
                    secretary, was out of town most of the time I was back. Nobody gave me a call to
                    reprimand me. I realize in retrospect I should not have given that interview. I
                    was talked into it and I shouldn't have been talked into it. But it certainly
                    put me on the TV circuit and in that sense gave me opportunities later on to try
                    to educate people on the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me talk a bit before we wind this up about being
                        extremely knowledgeable about the Middle East. At the same time there is
                        almost the taint of being an Arabist which has been put into terms of
                        somehow you are anti-Semitic and you are the bad guy for the Pro-Israeli
                        side. How did you find yourself in this...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: The Arabist taint became evident only about half way through my career.
                    Joseph Kraft wrote a piece in the New York Times magazine in 1971 alluding to
                    “those Arabists in the State Department.” We had never called ourselves
                    Arabists. We studied Arabic and specialized in the area. We were Middle East
                    experts or specialists. If anybody had mentioned the term Arabist to me, I would
                    have thought of an academician, a scholar, somebody who knows the ancient
                    languages, etc. You might also have thought of some of the romantic British
                    types, Lawrence of Arabia, etc. I don't think we thought of ourselves as
                    Arabists. The term was first used by Kraft I think and from then on it became a
                    pejorative term implying we were too pro-Arab and not sufficiently attuned to
                    Israel's interests. But I don't ever remember in the Department or in the
                    Foreign Service that the issue ever came up. I think as the Israeli lobby began
                    to get more powerful in the eighties, it began to make the word more and more
                    pejorative.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>I remember that whenever we went on a trip to the Middle East (I had two
                    assignments in Washington as so-called desk officer) we were told to stop in
                    Israel. And I always did. In fact, when I was in Jordan, 1952-54, I made a point
                    of going to Israel several times. What you did was; you went down to Jerusalem
                    to the Mendelbaum Gate and replaced your Jordanian plates with Israeli plates
                    provided by the Consulate General. In Israel, you would pick up hitchhikers and
                    this way learn what was going on, what people were thinking. We became quite
                    aware of how U.S. policy was geared to reflect domestic political interests.
                    That was quite clear to all of us. We didn't feel it was our job, in our
                    recommendations, to address that interest. That was for the people above. They
                    could take care of domestic interests. Our job was to recommend policies that we
                    thought were in U.S. national interests. This we did. Then, if our reports were
                    discounted for political domestic reasons, that was up to the Assistant
                    Secretary, or the Secretary, not us.</p>
                <p>I remember when I was desk officer for Arabian Peninsula Affairs, 1961-64, an
                    officer of the Israeli embassy who handled Middle East affairs cultivated us. He
                    happened to be an Iraqi Jew. We used to have lunch together quite often, speak
                    Arabic, and eat at Arab restaurants. The Israeli embassy would invite us to
                    their balls every year. So we had association with Israelis. I don't think we
                    thought of ourselves as anti-Israeli. We just thought of ourselves as
                    specialists in the Middle East and on Arabs. We felt that U.S. interests should
                    be broad enough to take into account not only Israel's interests, but other
                    interests. If anybody asked us, “Is Israel important to us?” The answer was in
                    the affirmative. One tenet of our policy was to assure the preservation of the
                    political independence and sovereignty of Israel. But we thought we should not
                    tilt so heavily towards Israel. There were other interests like oil. So that was
                    the position that we all took. But, of course, when you took that position, in
                    the eyes of the Israeli lobby or those who were 100 percent pro-Israeli, it
                    meant that you were anti-Israel. That is where we got into trouble.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SEELYE: All right.</p>
