                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 8th of January 2001. This is an interview
                        with Joseph C. Wilson. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Can you tell
                        me when and where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I am from a California family. I was born, almost by accident, in
                    Connecticut. I lived there for about four months and then went to California. I
                    make that point because whenever I give a speech people will inevitably, when
                    they see I was born in Connecticut, come up and ask me if I am from the same
                    town they were from. I have no recollection whatsoever of Connecticut. On the
                    other hand, my family roots go back to California for over 200 years. We are an
                    old California family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was born in November of 1949 and spent the first six or seven years of
                    my existence in the Bay area, which is the family home. We lived in southern
                    California after that and then moved to Europe for four years in the 1960s where
                    I went to high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back and get a little feel for your family. To
                        have a family for 200 years in California is pretty unusual. Where did your
                        mother and father come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My mother's family is the California side of the family; they had moved
                    to Californivarious wings of the family moved to Californias I said, between 150
                    and 200 years ago. They were shepherds and ran sheep and cattle ranches from the
                    Oregon border down to Los Angeles. At one time their fattening ranch was the
                    bottom land along both sides of the Napa River between Napa and Calistoga.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the shepherding come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Most of the came from the UK. There is some French or Basque in there but
                    I think most of the French and Basque were hired help. There is a large
                    population of Basque shepherds in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I did business with them back in the 1950s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They go back far longer than that. If you look at the demographics, there
                    is are awful lot of them in Nevada and in the shepherding range area of the
                    United States. In more recent times, my family were the Rolphs and the Moores;
                    they were big players in northern California politics and then later California
                    politics from about the time of the earthquake until the Great Depressio1906 to
                    about 1930 or 1932. My great uncle was Mayor of San Francisco from 1913 to 1928
                    and then he was Governor of California from 1928 until he died in office in
                    1931/32. The Moore side of the familthey were the Moore Dry Dock Companbuilt
                    many ships for the Pacific fleet and the bridges and the infrastructure that was
                    built in northern California during the first half of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me something about your mother's education and
                        interests and all, and then we'll turn to your father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: She was raised in San Francisco and Napa, and she went to the usual
                    parochial schools, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a Catholic family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, it was an Episcopal family, but she went to a Catholic school. She
                    went to the University of California at Berkeley and graduated. She went into
                    war. She was an aide de camp to a Marine commandant here in Washington and then
                    went back and finished her education at Cal Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she in the Marine Corps actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: She was in the Marine Corps. She was whatever they called them in the
                    Marines at that time during the course of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't too many women...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILSON: No, she was one of the very few who was actually enlisted in the Marine
                    Corps. Her father was a captain in the Navy in the Second World War and was, I
                    think, in the Army in the First World War. He was a pilot in the First World
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were your father's grandparents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My father moved out to California when he was about 10 or 11 from
                    Pennsylvania. He grew up in Pasadena, went to Pasadena High, and then he too
                    went to the University of California at Berkeley. He was the son of an Army Air
                    colonel. My grandfather was always referred to as “the Colonel.” He been a pilot
                    in the First World War and had been shot down four times; he crashed his
                    airplane each time, but walked away from three of the four crashes and was
                    dragged away from the fourth one with a couple broken legs. He won both the
                    Victorian Cross and the French Legion d'honneur for his activities in the First
                    World War. He came from an old Pittsburgh family. The first Joseph C. WilsoI am
                    the fourth with the same namwas an architect and a builder in Pittsburgh who was
                    quite well know, I guess, at the turn of the century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do during World War Two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At the time of the Second War he too went into the Marine Corps. Actually
                    he went into pilot training in the Navy, and at that time the top graduates of
                    flight training school had their choice of going into the Navy or Marine Corps.
                    He went into the Marine Corps, and flew off the carrier “The Franklin” during
                    the Second War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he on it when it took its major hit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was the last pilot off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Franklin didn't sink, but it was certainly badly
                        damaged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I believe the single largest number of casualties of any ship which was
                    attacked in Second War. He was the last pilot off. He got off because the fellow
                    who was in line ahead of him couldn't get his plane to turn over; so they pushed
                    his plane out of the way and put my dad's plane on the track; he got off just as
                    the Japanese plane was coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a kamikaze attack.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILSON: It wasn't a kamikaze attack. The Japanese dropped a bomb. He was coming
                    in, and apparently he and my father just sort of crossed. One was coming in and
                    one was going off. My father used to tell the story that he then had the
                    Japanese plane in his sights and was prepared to take it down when his wing
                    commander waved him off and took the shot himself. I think there were about 1200
                    casualties. Most of the people who were on the flight deck were killed or very
                    badly injured; so he was lucky to get off. He used to like to tell the story
                    when he was alive, that his personal loss was just his $600 in poker
                    earnings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have some horrendous pictures of the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You know, in those days people didn't talk about things like that. All my
                    life, my dad never talked to me about the trauma of losing a lot of his mates in
                    that attack, although you're absolutely right, it must have been terrible. There
                    was a lot of fuel on deck, and it was very, very bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were born in Connecticut in 1949. This was, of
                        course, after the war. What was your family doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My father graduated from Berkeley and got married in 1946. They lived in
                    California, and he got a job with one of the Pittsburgh steel companieI forget
                    which one it wawhich sent him to New York. They were there for a couple of
                    years, I guess, during which time they lived in Connecticut, where they
                    conceived me. Then he had about enough of the East Coast, so they went back out
                    west.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you as a kid? You said that for the first few
                        years you were in the Bay area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Right. For the first memorable years I was in Lafayette which is right
                    outside of San Francisco. It's just across the Bay. At that time it was not
                    really the suburbs; it was still pretty country and you could drive into the
                    city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I went to elementary school there and spent from 1950 until about 1957
                    there. My extended family was so very, very close and very big in San
                    Franciscvery active. So all of my memories are of San Francisco society and
                    going with my parents to the St. Francis Yacht Club, where my mom had grown
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the school system there? The California school
                        system was considered both quite modern and quite good at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Absolutely. I think the California education system in those days was one
                    of the best in the country. As a kid going to elementary school, we didn't have
                    much to compare it too; so I don't know how good the education was relative to
                    elsewhere, but it was generally regarded to be very good, and in fact it was.
                    School classes were not very large. The attention that kids got was extensive.
                    We were not living in the city, but we were close enough to the city that you
                    could go in anytime you wanteanytime my parents would go into the city. We had
                    pond on our property where we would fish out the tadpoles and do the sort of
                    stuff that kids did in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about school there? We're still talking about
                        elementary school. Were you getting into reading and activities like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure; just like every other kid. I don't have any real conscious memories
                    of sitting down and being a great leader at age six or seven. My memories of
                    growing up in that area were largely of being outside and climbing hills that
                    were unoccupied and fishing, as I said, tadpoles out of ponds and riding my bike
                    all around the neighborhoods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at home? Did you have brothers and
                        sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I have a younger brother who is two years younger than me. He was born in
                    San Francisco. He was my only sibling.</p>
                <p>At home we had a piano. My parents futilely tried to teach me to play and read
                    music. Unfortunately that was not anything that I picked up at all. Neither did
                    my brother, for that matter. We had a swimming pool, we lived up on a hill, and
                    we did a lot of outdoors type stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at the dinner table? Some families sit around
                        and talk about events of the day. Were you picking up book lore or politics
                        or anything else at the table?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, in my family politics were a daily staple, particularly California
                    politics because of the role that my family had played in California politics.
                    Up until the 1980s there was always a member of the family on the Board of
                    Regents at the University of California, for example. Even though the peak of
                    the family's participation in politics was in 1932 when my great uncle was
                    Governor, the family still remained very active in state politics thereafter and
                    by extension in national politics. It was an old Republican family. During the
                    election periodI remember the elections of 1952 when I was very, very young and
                    1956...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. In the debate that went on in our house during that period,
                    Adlai Stevenson was quite a candidate, and yet, of course, in the Wilson
                    household we were all for Ike. I remember we had a very small black and white
                    TV. One of my earliest memories was watching the election returns and
                    Stevenson's concession speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Senator Knowland play any part in your conversations.
                        He was on the international scene, particularly as it concerned with Chiang
                        Kai shek and the Taiwan independence. He was a major player. He was from the
                        Berkeley area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was not a friend of my immediate family that I recall. He may have
                    been a friend of other parts of the family, but I don't recall ever seeing him
                    our house or he being in anything that involved me. We, of course, knew who he
                    was, and I think maybe other parts of the family probably were closer to him. At
                    that time, he would have been a senator and we would have been very young; there
                    may have been instances when my parents went to events that were being hosted by
                    my grandfather that might have involved Knowland. I wouldn't be surprised at
                    that at all. In fact, I'm quite sure the family would have known him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earl Warrehe was Governor during part of that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was Governor and then he was on the Supreme Court during that time. He
                    was appointed by Eisenhower. Eisenhower, I guess, afterwards was heard to have
                    said that it was his most disappointing appointment, because the Earl Warren
                    family turned out to be far more liberal than Eisenhower had wanted or expected,
                    and far more activist. Those of us in my generation, we applaud that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I know Warren might have really thought that 'one man, one vote' was an
                    important concept to the adjudication of a Presidential election.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you move down to southern California?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILSON: In 1956 or 1957 we moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, which at that time was a
                    brand new, just being developed suburb of Phoenix. We moved there because my dad
                    had arthritic knees and so he wanted to get some dry heat. He thought that that
                    might be better to move there for a couple of years. One of my grandfather's
                    brothers lived in the area. So we lived there for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in high school by that time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, I was still in elementary school. I would have been in fifth or sixth
                    grade. I was nine years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Arizona schools? Was there a noticeable
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not that I particularly noticed. Again, my recollection of schooling was
                    all small classroom. This was not the era of the one room schoolhouse anymore,
                    and we didn't have to walk seven miles through the snow barefoot to get there
                    and back as our parents used to tell us that they had to do. I suspect that if
                    people go back and look at the history of American education, it was probably a
                    very good period. School classes were no more than about 25 to a class. Teachers
                    were generally young and dedicated and motivated and were not overwhelmed by the
                    bureaucracy. So Arizona was a good, positive experience as well. I did pretty
                    well in school there.</p>
                <p>We were there for a couple years, and then my parents decided that they would go
                    to Europe for six months in 1959. We left for Europe in January of 1959. We came
                    back six months later, and we actually came back through Washington. I have a
                    picture of my brother and me standing in front of the White House in 195a little
                    over 40 years ago. We sailed to Europe. Those were the days when you could still
                    take these sailing vessels to Europe. In fact, we flew across the country,
                    stopping in Chicago, on the old turbo props. It was just right before the jet
                    age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Lockheed Electras, I think, were one of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There was the Electra, the Trident, the Viscounsomething like that. We
                    took the “SS Augustus,” which was an Italian ship, to Europe; it was a bit of a
                    cruise. We stopped in Bermuda, we stopped in the Azores, and then we stopped in
                    Casablanca, Gibraltar, Barcelona, and then we got off in Cannes, I guess it was.
                    We bought a car. We bought an old 1950s Citroen, which was the old gangster
                    shaped car.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Black, yes. This was an old taxi and so it had jump seats. It was a long.
                    We drove that around Europe for six months. We spent almost all of our time in
                    southern Europe. We went as far south as Italy and then the southern part of
                    France. Actually we dipped up into Sweden for a couple days, but we spent most
                    of our time between Italy, southern France and southern Spain. It was six months
                    during the school year; so we didn't do much schooling, but we did spend a
                    couple of months in Spain where we went to a Berlitz schoosomething along those
                    linean elementary school, for a couple of months in a little town called
                    Portemarinos, which is right outside of Malaga, which at that timfrom the
                    pictures we have in the old scrapboowas still just a fishing village. It's now
                    just wall to wall apartments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's one of those English colonies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We lived quite literally 100 yards from the Mediterranean. I suppose that
                    for my parents this was a real epiphany. They decided that this was their last
                    town. They really enjoyed it. We followed the opening of the bullfight season;
                    we went to Sippia for the Easter fiesta, and then we followed the bullfighters
                    all around southern Spain. In 1959 in southern Spain you could still see people
                    living in caves. The country was very much in the grips of the Franco regime.
                    Yet it was still quintessentially Spanisthe Spain of the Hemingway novels in the
                    sense that if you were a foreigner, an expatriate, you were living life at a
                    certain level, but if you were Spanish, you lived at a different levethe Spain
                    of old ladies wearing black for many, many years; people traveling as much on
                    burros and burro drawn carts as they were in automobiles; and dirt roads going
                    to the little towns in the interior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some thirty years later or so, Spain really became part of
                        Western Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. This was still when the Pyrenees were a big border between
                    the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. I think the Franco government was
                    part of the reason obviously. As the rest of Europe was moving toward some form
                    of democratization, Spain was still very much in a dictatorship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still quite young, of course, but were you
                        picking up any vibrations about the government at that time therthat this
                        was not a government that really Americans cottoned up to or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILSON: In 1959 we were still in the aftermath of the McCarthy hearings and
                    everything that had happened during the “Commie” scare. Western European
                    politics were defined in different terms. So I don't think that the Franco
                    regime was an anathema to the American government. They certainly didn't appear
                    to be. What was much more of concern to them were the Communities Parties of
                    Italy and France. So if you were anti Communist, which, of course, Franco was,
                    then you stood to have...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's when we started putting our bases in there,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I don't know when the bases went in, but certainly we had bases in Rota
                    then as I recall. My parents used to go to Gibraltar a lot, to get their
                    cigarettes and whatever sort of contraband you could get more cheaply there. We
                    used to go to the villages and do the Hemingway routine following the bullfights
                    and bullfighters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Than after this six month interlude, what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We came back to southern California in July, 1959, where my other
                    grandparents, my dad's side of the family, lived outside of Los Angeles. They
                    lived in a place called Altadena, which was just north of Pasadena.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My grandfather is buried there. What were your
                        grandparents doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were retired there, having lived in the area since the 1930s. My
                    grandfather at that time had already passed away, and my grandmother was pretty
                    close to dying. She had lung canceshe was part of that great smoking
                    generatioand so she didn't last too long. That was where my father had grown up;
                    so that's where we ended up after we left Europe. We lived there from 1959 to
                    1963 in a place called San Marino, which was just south of Pasadena.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Went to San Marino junior high there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Henry Hunington Elementary, and then I also went
                        to South Pas Junior High. Did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I did it the other way. We moved back and we lived in an apartment in
                    South Pasadena, so I went to South Pas junior high.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were in South Pasadena just very briefly, just long enough to find a
                    place in San Marino. We moved to San Marino to a house right along the San
                    Marino/San Gabriel border. We were still the San Marino school district. Then I
                    too went to Henry E. Huntington Junior High.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Not too many alumni here in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. So which part of San Marino did you live in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We lived on a street called El Molino. We were on the
                        northern side of the railroad tracks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were pretty much neighbors then. We lived on Robin Road, which was
                    literally a half a block long; we would have been just a couple blocks toward
                    San Gabriel from you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was one block oveLorraine was half a block down, and
                        then there was Robin Road, right by a reservoir. Know it well.</hi>

                <p>WILSON: So we grew up close to each other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a different era; were you there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was there then from 1959 to 1963 and I did sixth, seventh and eighth
                    grade there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time San Marino had its own junior high?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes; it was actually Henry Huntington, which went up to eighth grade.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WILSON: We went back to Europe in 1963. We also had a summer place in San
                    Clemente where we used to surf. My dad had grown up doing that, surfing in
                    Pasadena and San Clemente and so we did that. We moved back to Europe in August
                    of 1963, thinking we were going to be living in Paris, but we found that the
                    weather in Paris was just too wet for any reasonable person from southern
                    California. In the 31 days of August in 1963, it rained 28 days. So my parents
                    decided we were going to do down to the Riviera. We lived in Nice for a year,
                    1963/64, but decided that Nice was too cold in the winter, so we moved to
                    Mallorca, Spain, for two year1964/66. During each of those summers we went over
                    to Biarritz and surfed. That was our summer vacation. My brother and I were the
                    first resident California surfers to become members of the Surf Club de France,
                    which included members of the French national surfing team. From 1966 to 1967,
                    which was my last year in high school, my parents thought that the best thing
                    for me would be to go to school. We moved to Montreaux, Switzerland for the
                    year. I did my senior year there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time in Europe, where were you going to high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: For the first year I went to a Catholic school in Nice. For the next two
                    years I went to Belver International School, which was a British run school in
                    Mallorca. We went to that British school and did “O” levels and prepared for
                    the” A” levels which was part of the British secondary school system. Then in
                    Switzerland in Montreaux I went to a school called Montarosa, which was really
                    on the eastern end of Montreaux towards the end of the lake. That school offered
                    both the U.S. exams and the British exams. I did both of those there, both the A
                    levels and the advanced placement and the SATs and everything else you had to do
                    to get into an American university.</p>

                        trying to keep up with your American system. Were you picking up languages
                        at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. In the French system, the classes were all in French. I found that
                    it took me about three months to really begin to understand French, about six
                    months to begin to read it, and at the nine month point I met a young lady in
                    France; then it became imperative that I learned how to speak. So at nine months
                    and two weeks, I was suddenly able to speak French as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>It was interesting. I never really saw my high school education in terms of how
                    it was going to prepare me for American university. It was just something that
                    one did as one was growing up. You had to go to school, and these were the
                    things that you had to do. The subject matters that we dealt with in France, we
                    dealt with them as the French kids did. The same thing in Majorca; we dealt with
                    them as any kid who is preparing for an English university. As I said, the
                    school we attended also offered the PSATs and the American examinations, so we
                    could take that. Mathematics and verbal skills are not that much different
                    whether the education if French or British or American style except in the way
                    that you express them in examinations. So we did both the English exams and the
                    American exams. I never really made a decision as to where I was going to go
                    college until I was a senior in Switzerland. I think if I had to assess the
                    relative educational systems based upon my experience, I would say that I had a
                    lot easier time of it at university having been schooled in the European system,
                    for two reasons: one, the British system requires you to write; so you have to
                    write essays (i.e. being able to do much more than just answer multiple choice
                    questions); two, having a knowledge of both French and Spanish, I could always
                    take a couple of courses at an American university pretty much guaranteed of
                    getting good grades without having to study too hard. Knowledge of one or two
                    foreign languages was always a boost to the grade point average at
                    university.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You know, when we lived in Nice, we found that the locals were not very
                    pro American. My parents particularly felt this; that there was a bit of anti
                    Americanism there. We also had a Volkswagen camper, which generated profoundly
                    anti German expressions. One time we had our tires slashed, which my parents
                    attributed to the basic French dislike of Americans and things German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also a time de Gaulle was really pushing the
                        nationalistic very hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. At the same time we used to have travelers come into Cannes all the
                    time; we used to always go and take trips on the visiting ships. There was a
                    group of Mormon missionaries in town who were trying to teach the French how to
                    drink wine and how to believe in Mormonism. They used to come by our house
                    because they wanted to speak American every now and again. I don't think they
                    were really seriously trying to proselyte us. There were real mixed feelings
                    about their effortIt was also the erin France in particulaof the Beatles and the
                    Rolling Stones whose music started coming to the continent. That started a
                    phenomenon in French music which was a direct copy of what was going on in the
                    States at the time; even there Johnny Holiday was getting support and he was
                    basically doing all covers of Elvis Presley songs at that time. As there is
                    today, this was a love/hate relationship with things American. This was before
                    Vietnam; so you didn't have that tremendous focal point of the Vietnamese War to
                    get people to being anti American. De Gaulle was making French nationalism the
                    coin of the realm, making the United States the external enemy. We didn't have
                    the same sense at that time as one would get from reading the history books on
                    that period. The decolonization of Africa and the Algerian War were the key to
                    the French psyche in those days as well. I must say I found the experience
                    living in southern France being very agreeable. I suspect my best memories,
                    however, are those years we spent in Mallorca. The weather was better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think Mallorca would be sort owell, to live in a

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Mallorca was the land of the lotus blossom; it already was a never never
                    land. In February of every year you had the almond blossoms, which turned the
                    entire island pink. We had racing bicycles and we would spend our weekends
                    riding around the island. Many of your natives shunned the tourists; that
                    allowed us as observers, to become the fount of all wisdom when young people
                    come to the island. When I lived there, two of the Rolling Stones bought a
                    nightclub there. The Animals bought a nightclub right across from our school. So
                    there was some glamor there. Even though Mallorca was a tourist destination at
                    the time relative to other parts of Europe it wasn't as nearly as touristy as it
                    is now. It was still new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Switzerland a little bit like somebody opened the
                        window and they ran outside and it was cold, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There are a couple of sort of common threads in the four years that we
                    spent in Europe. One was doing things athletic. We had bicycles; we were living
                    by the ocean, and so we had rowboats and went swimming. Every time that there
                    were waves, we'd go body surfing even if in February; we spent a lot of our
                    summers surfing. The flip side of surfing is skiing. When we went to
                    Switzerland, it was not so much that it was cold but it was an opportunity to do
                    something that was like surfing but do it in the winter and on land.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The other common thread is that everywhere we lived, we had a viewhen we lived in
                    Nice we had a view of the Mediterranean. When we lived in Mallorca, we lived
                    right on the sea. When we lived in Montreaux we lived with a view of the lake
                    and of the valley. I don't know what that particularly means in my life except
                    ever since, I've always looked for houses with a view.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. Even when living in Washington, I have always looked for
                    houses on the Potomac and I actually have a house that has a view noSo that was
                    a common thread.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In 1966 and 1967 we lived in Switzerland. This was the final year. My
                    parents came back to the U.S. about six months before we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, your parents, were they essentially living off
                        income or did they have a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Both my parents were writing for a syndicate and other publications. They
                    wrote articles which chronicled matters that were different in Europe from the
                    United States. It is hard now to see where there would be an audience for that,
                    but then there were not that many Americans traveling and the Western
                    worlWestern Europe and the United Statehad not become so homogenized. So each
                    continent had its own idiosyncracies and unique attributee.g. the village
                    parties in the summer with the band and everybody gathering; things like that.
                    We have scrapbooks of their newspaper articles at that time. So they wrote
                    really for four years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the early 1970s...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We left Europe before drugs were really introduced in Europe. By the time
                    we got back to California, there was already a flourishing drug culture
                    thermarijuana and some of the psychedelics. You didn't have the hard cocaine and
                    heroin consumption that you did later. But in Europe there wasn't much of that
                    at all. The Americans, and other foreigners, that we would run into, on a
                    regular basis, were either middle class tourists or surfers.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILSON: While I was sitting in Switzerland and thinking about my future, I was
                    filling out applications to Oxford and Cambridge and the Sorbonne; I was
                    considering staying in Europe. By this time I saw myself pretty much as an
                    international citizen. I started thumbing through some of my old surfer
                    magazines and I came across one whose cover said, “It takes a B average to slide
                    a campus point.” I thumbed through it and there were 14 pages of perfect waves
                    at the University of California at Santa Barbara. So I threw all the other
                    applications away and filled out the form for the University of California at
                    Santa Barbara. As you can see, one of the themes through my early life was
                    surfing and sports in general, but surfing was an anchor. Surfing was the one
                    thing that brought us back every year to the same group of friends and kept us
                    in contact with our buddies in California.</p>

                        wrong, because I'm just observing it. But people get jobs in order to
                        surf.</hi>

                <p>WILSON: It leads to a lifestyle that they enjoy. But that's exactly right. It's
                    always been much more of a lifestyle than a sport. But I suppose it's not any
                    more of a lifestyle than that led by people who get into golf early and decide
                    that their life is going to revolve around golf, or horses or skiing for that
                    matter.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WILSON: Davis is agricultural. Santa Cruz was always thought to be sort of
                    philosophical. Berkeley was always the political one. Irvine was a campus for
                    southern California, and nobody quite knew what Santa Barbara was. UCLA was the
                    big southern California campus before it went to Berkeley. UCSB had started out
                    as a teachers' school, but when I was there it was known for its emphasis on
                    oceanography; it was also good in engineering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1967 to 1971 was sort of the height, certainly at
                        Berkeley, of agitation. I guess the free speech movement was over by that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In Berkeley the free speech movement and related efforts started about
                    1963/64. It remained a strong voice, and although not a really large movement,
                    it morphed into the anti Vietnam movement in about 1967 and 1968. My entering
                    class was probably the first class that from the time we started as freshmen was
                    bombarded by the anti war sentiment. The sophomores, and certainly the seniors,
                    were a lot different in terms of their outlook on life. Between 1967 and 1971,
                    we had various demonstrations in Santa Barbara itself. We had the burning of the
                    American flag in Buena Vista; we had a kid who was shot and killed; we had the
                    National Guard called out twice. We were part of that cohort that was in college
                    during the transition from the old draft system to a lottery system. We used to
                    say that the difference between Berkeley and Santa Barbara was that Berkeley was
                    a commuter school which being a highly politicized school knew the value of
                    getting their riots in during the day so that they could be on the evening news;
                    we in Santa Barbara had other things to do during the day like surfing and
                    smoking dope and drinking red wine; we could never get together to go rioting
                    until after the sun had gone down. But our riots were every bit as intense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your involvement in these campus activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: As I said, I had come back from Switzerland, knowing that in Europe in
                    the 1960s, the students were already much more anti U.S. involvement in the
                    Vietnam War than we were in the States and much more hostile to it. I found
                    myself in a school in Switzerland with a bunch of British professors who were
                    essentially opposed to the Vietnam policy of our government, and I objected to
                    their views as any patriot would do when confronting a bunch of foreigners. I
                    came back to California and found that maybe defending our continued
                    participation in the Vietnam War was not what I wanted to do. I was as
                    influenced as everybody else was by events at the university and by the anti war
                    movement. We had activities on our campus which ignited the first of the riots

                <p>WILSON: There was a lawyer for these rebels. Like everybody else, I was
                    influenced by that. I never played any role in the anti war movement. We used to
                    go to the marches, and we walked through the campus and the town. A couple of my
                    roommates and I walked through the Bank of America as it was burning, but we
                    didn't actually light any matches. We didn't throw any rocks, although I had a
                    friend, a fraternity brother, who was a member of the golf team, who would sit
                    out behind the house and hit pitching wedges into the police roadblocks 120
                    yards away. But we never really were major players in those riots.</p>

                <p>WILSON: He was out of the Marines by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still had the background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Remember, of course, that this was the Nixon Administration. He had
                    brought to Washington a bunch of Californians including neighbors of ours such
                    as an Assistant Attorney General who was indicted and convictealthough his
                    conviction was overturned in the Watergate trials. He was also known as the one
                    who decided that they would use RFK Stadium as the place to house all the anti
                    war protestors they arrested here in the 1968 riots in Washington. These guys
                    were pretty radical Republican. John Mitchell used to come by the house fairly
                    frequently when the White House moved to San Clemente every summer. That was
                    where my parents lived at the time. So we had all these guys around all the
                    time. There was a fair amount of tension in the relationship, although to my
                    father's great credit, he was not nearly as far out there as was Bob Halderman
                    and some of the other Nixon Republicans on this issue. I don't know if that's
                    because my father finally began to listen to me or if for other reasons he
                    finally concluded that this was not a war that was winnable in the way that was
                    being fought. I just don't know. We never really discussed the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you also picking up sort of the real time when there
                        was a real generational gap, when everybody over the age of 30 was beyond
                        it. Being beyond 30 at that time myself, I sort of have the feeling that
                        your generation was the first one that grew up with the feeling that
                        original sin did not include them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I suppose people looked at the 65 to 70 crowd, in that way; if you read
                    the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, Tom Wolf's story of Ken Kesey and the Merry
                    Pranksters, you might have concluded that, although it does seem to me that we
                    were pretty tame relative to those who came after us. We might have opened the
                    door. I think the use of marijuana and the soft drugs was obviously much more
                    prevalent in our crowd than it had been in those that went before us. Woodstock
                    was kind of at the very end of the 1960s.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Certainly the music was a lot different. My father would listen to Dean Martin
                    and Frank Sinatra, and I would listen to the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson
                    Airplane. There was a real disconnect. I remember that very clearly, because my
                    own son is now 21 and I do try and listen to his music just to have some sense
                    of what he's listening to. It is as difficult for me to understand his music as
                    my music must have been for my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somehow I think during this whole period there was one
                        aspect that I found on which there was just no meeting of the mind and that
                        was music. On almost everything else, I can see their point of view, but
                        music really was not. This was a new phenomenon. I think it started about
                        that time. Before then, everybody listened to the Hit Parade and that music
                        sort of covered the whole spectrum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the late 1960s it sort of chopped up into various
                        groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. It became very difficult for adults to understand what the
                    kids were listening to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. During one of the semesters the university basically suspended
                    school because of the riots. I majored in history. I suppose I was pretty much
                    of an indifferent student. I had my gentleman's Bs. I had a B to B+ average, but
                    I never worked too hard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feel for what was going on in the

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WILSON: We were very interested in what was happening, because we were
                    potentially going to be dragged into it either willingly or against our will
                    because of the military draft system; so we were keenly interested in the
                    politics of the time. Even if we were not leaders of the anti war movement, we
                    were certainly sympathetic to it and we certainly did participate in a lot of
                    the marches. During the election of 1968, Bobby Kennedy came to Santa Barbara
                    the day before he got shot in Los Angeles, and we saw him. We were all sort of
                    pro Bobby Kennedy and anti Ronnie Reagan and anti Nixon and anti Johnson. I'm
                    not sure that our politics was terribly well defined other than by a general
                    sense that being in Vietnam was not a good thing for us.</p>

                        Officer. You'd gone to school abroad. Had a career in the Foreign Service

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I had thought of the Foreign Service as something that might be of
                    interest from the time I was about nine years old, when we had first met the
                    American consul general in Barcelona, Spain. When I was in Majorca, my great
                    aunt, who lived in Majorca, was the curator of the Fra [Father] Junipero Serra
                    Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went through the California public school system, and
                        you learned a hell of a lot about Fra Junipero Serra.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My great uncle, when he was Governor of California, was known for two
                    things: one, he wore cowboy boots all the time; and two, he was the one who was
                    responsible for putting the Fra Junipero Serra statue in Statuary Hall of the
                    Capitol. His cousin had married a British author and they had moved to Mallorca,
                    where she had taken on this task in the Father Junipero Serra Foundation in
                    Mallorca. Every year to celebrate his birth or something, they would have a
                    celebration and the American ambassador would come ovethat was Angier Biddle
                    Duke at the time. I remember meeting Duke for the first time when I was 13 or 14
                    years old. I was really struck by the fact that this guy was wearing patent
                    leather shoes with bows on them. I couldn't quite figure that out, but it was a
                    nice pair of shoes. Meeting the American ambassador also had an influencI was at
                    a very impressionable age and I met him a couple times. I also have friends who
                    remind me that even in college I talked about an international career. An old
                    girlfriend who got in touch with me couple of years agI hadn't seen her in 30
                    yearsaid, “You always used to talk about becoming an international lawyer.” So I
                    suppose that I had talked about a career in international affairs and that that
                    had always been an option, although at university, I suppose, we were united in
                    our distrust of the government and in our opposition to the Vietnam War. The
                    slogans of the period included “Don't trust anybody over 30,” “Tune in, turn on,
                    and drop out,” and “Hope I die before I get old”that sort of sentiment. At the
                    time that I was at the University of California at Santa Barbara, working for
                    the sort of fascist government of the United States of America that was in power
                    at the time, was something that I would not have considered.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>When I took my semi obligatory hitchhiking trip through Europe in 1970, that
                    feeling about the government was just reinforced, as every bridge you would go
                    under in France would have graffiti on it: “Down the USA,” “Out of Vietnam,”
                    “U.S. Equals CIA,” and that sort of stuff. There was a lot of anti Americanism,
                    anti U.S. government hostility. I remember going to a social political function.
                    We were hitchhiking through France and got picked up by these kids who were
                    going to an occasion being put on by the French Communist Party, which was a
                    legitimate political party in France. Like all the political parties, they
                    hosted these soirees. This was a party in the main square of some village in
                    France. The French kids said, “You have to come with us;” we said “yes” and went
                    to the party. I got up my nerve to go and asked this little French girl to
                    dance. We were dancing and having a good time, and she detected a bit of an
                    accent and she asked me where I was from. I said I was from the United
                    StateCaliforniat which point she stopped dancing with me immediately and turned
                    and walked away and wouldn't have anything more to do with me. So the anti
                    Americanism was evident. At that time my vision of the future did not include
                    working for a US government which might be headed by a Ronald Reagan or a
                    Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan was the Governor of California and he was the one
                    who called out the National Guard when we were rioting, which we felt was a bit
                    much. It stopped the riots and it was probably in that respect a very successful
                    maneuver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been the Kent State event.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Kent State was in the Spring of 1970. That was when we were having big
                    riots in Santa Barbara as well. We had riots in 1968, 1969 and 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't feel the Guard might fire on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. Actually, a lot of us had friends who were in the Guard, but its
                    presence really did stop the rioting for me. In the late spring, after Kent
                    State, when they had the riots and they called the Guard out, the imposed a
                    curfew from 6:30 on. Where we were in Santa Barbara, the campus town was right
                    next to the campusort of one square mile, and it was pretty easy to secure. When
                    the Guard came in, it came in overwhelming force, and made it clear that if you
                    weren't off the streets by 6:30, you were going to hell. I had friends who were
                    coming back from the beach at about 6:30 in their wetsuits with the surfboards
                    and they were hauled off. One of my friends was walking from next door to an
                    apartment roommate after 6:30, and he got hauled off.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WILSON: My last class was in 1971. I actually had to write a paper, which took me
                    a lot longer to write than I had anticipated. I then decided that I was going to
                    do something that was completely different from a university life; so I signed
                    up for the carpenters union's apprenticeship program. I had odd jobs during the
                    summer, and I got into the union program in September. I spent the next three
                    and a half to four years as a carpenter. I built houses in Santa Barbara, and
                    then when I got enough money, I moved up to Lake Tahoe and was a ski bum for a
                    couple of years. I built houses and condominiums in Lake Tahoe during that time.
                    I broke me leg skiing, moved back down to Santa Barbara and started building
                    again in Santa Barbara. Got married and moved up to Washington state and lived
                    up in Washington state, building houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One, how did sort of moving into the blue collar class as
                        a carpenter sit with the family? And, two, was this done as something you
                        really wanted to do, or was this a rebellion or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: First of all, I think the family at that time was probably just glad that
                    I was out earning my own living, although I actually paid my own way through
                    college. They had not contributed from my freshman year on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Anything, anything and everything. I was a school bus driver for a
                    private school in Santa Barbara for three years and that paid pretty well. I
                    tended bar. I was a gardener. I cut grass and kept people's yards in shape.
                    During the Halloween season we had a bunch of pumpkin patches and we would lay
                    pumpkins, load trucks to earn moneanything and everything. I worked delivering
                    and selling refrigerators. I worked at a nursery, produced mums for an estate.
                    Whatever was available. So the family was just glad that I seemed to be doing
                    something that was steady, and I think that at that time they just assumed that
                    life goes othey had done their bit. My father always said that, “All I can leave
                    you with really is a good education. That's the best I can do for you.”</p>
                <p>In terms of whether I liked carpentry or whether it was more of a rebellion, I
                    enjoyed it very much. It was good work, steady every day. In Santa Barbara and
                    Lake Tahoe, it was a good way to make a lot of money and to ski. During the
                    winter we would work indoors a couple days a week and weekends, and we would ski
                    during the week when all the tourists had gone home. So it was a nice lifestyle.
                    I certainly was not the only college graduate at the time who was doing that. I
                    made pretty good money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that this was fun but there was
                        going to be something else later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think everybody, certainly the guys I worked with, became contractors
                    if they stayed in the trade. In my last year I became a contractor. It was
                    pretty clear that once you mastered the trade that you were going to do other
                    things with it other than just working for some one else. In fact, during my
                    time in Santa Barbara and Lake Tahoe and later in Washington state, I worked on
                    projects that were not factory, assembly line projects. I worked on high end
                    houses which required a small group of people to work from beginning to end. We
                    would do the laying out; we would do the pouring of the concrete; we would do
                    the foundations; we would do the framing; we would do the finish work on the
                    house, so that we experienced the breadth of work from beginning to end. The
                    difference being that in Santa Barbara it was always warm, so it was great
                    weather all the time; at Lake Tahoe if it was not warm, you were skiing, so it
                    didn't make any difference. Once I got to Washington state it was cold and it
                    was wet and it was miserable and there wasn't anything to do if it was cold and
                    wet and miserable except to woryou didn't the alternative of skiing or surfing
                    or whatever.</p>

                    return to Santa Barbara, she was still in school. We would go out. When I broke
                    my leg, I was hitchhiking around California and I would go to Santa Barbara a
                    lot and see her. We were just sort of hanging out. She was from the Los Angeles
                    area. When we decided to get married, we agreed that we would just basically
                    pack up my pickup truck and drive north until we found a place we liked and just
                    there settle for awhile to see what it felt like. We went up and we ended up in
                    Sequim, Washington, which is on the Olympic Peninsula. We had some friends who
                    had moved up there a few years before, so we knew we were going to go up there,
                    but we didn't know we would stay there. We settled there for a couple years. We
                    lived in a house on the Dungeness Plain and worked. We decided in 1974 that
                    maybe there was something else to do besides build houses all the time. We
                    looked at the University of Washington graduate schoothe University of
                    Washington School of Public Affairs. It offered a Master's of Public
                    Administration degree with a good International Relations option, which was of
                    interest to me. I thought this was something where I could use my foreign
                    languages and my international experience. To get into the School of Public
                    Affairs you had to demonstrate a commitment to public service. I had no public
                    service experience other than collecting unemployment insurance when I was a ski
                    bum. So I took the Foreign Service exam, and I got into the program at the
                    University of Washington. I also got a fellowship to a university wide program
                    at Eastern Washington State. I ended up going to Spokane for a semester; I also
                    passed the Foreign Service exam.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I hadn't really thought about the Foreign Service exam for a number of
                    years, although the idea of diplomatic service was something that still appealed
                    to me, I didn't quite know how to get there from here. When we had the luxury of
                    some spare time in Washington, we looked at everything from Peace Corps to the
                    Foreign Service exam and then decided that I would just go ahead and take it
                    just to see how I would do. I did a little research on it and found that you're
                    not penalized if you don't pass it and that a lot of people took it more than
                    two or three times before passing it. Also I found that there wasn't very much
                    you could do to really prepare for it. You couldn't read all the books needed to
                    pass a graduate school exam. I did take about two months off and I spent all day
                    in the library in Sequim, Port Angeles. I got books on American history and
                    world history and economics and just studied up trying to bring myself up to
                    speed. At the same time I got hold of all the copies of the books to help me
                    prepare for the graduate entrance exam. I took all the sample tests; I really
                    just spent a couple months studying. I took both of those examgraduate school
                    and Foreign Servicin December of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I came out of the Foreign Service exam I told my wife that in my
                    exataking history, this was the only time that I had ever finished a test not
                    having a clue as to whether I'd done well, indifferent or very poorly. A couple
                    weeks later I got the exam results and I passed, which surprised me. I had also
                    done very well on the graduate school entrance exam. So we started focusing on a
                    potential new lifestyle. At that time I was in the throes of building a small
                    contracting business. I had a contract to build a house for a guy; I did that,
                    made some money doing it.</p>
                <p>We moved over to Spokane, Washington, and I started graduate school while waiting
                    for the Foreign Service exam process to work itself out. I had taken the oral
                    exam in, I guess, April or May of 1975. That was interesting. As a matter of
                    fact, I was just looking at some pictures the other day out in California, the
                    day before I took the exam and the day of the exam, wearing a tie and hair
                    closely cropped. I went over to the Federal Building in Seattle and walked in.
                    When my turn came, they opened the door, and this lady steps oualready I was
                    pretty surpriseand stuck her hand out. When you're in the trades, you didn't see
                    very many women on the work site. You certainly didn't shake hands with anybody,
                    much less some woman in a business suit. She said, “How do you do? My name is
                    Sarah Nathwess.” I was so taken aback, but I managed to say, “How do you do,
                    Miss Nathwess?” It took me about three time to get her name right. The exam went
                    downhill from there. But for some reason they decided that I had done okay in
                    the examination. There were three examiners. There was the woman who met me at
                    the door and two men.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>When the exam was finished, I left the room; they came out a few minutes later
                    and said, “Congratulations. You've passed.” That left me trying to figure out
                    what to do next; while I was getting my papers, the secretary said,
                    “Congratulations. They've been here for two weeks, and you're only the third or
                    fourth person that they've accepted.” I said, “I'm surprised. I didn't think I'd
                    done that well.” This was the year of the publication of Alistair Cook's book on
                    America; one of the first questions they asked me was, “If you were a consular
                    officer in Hungary and some guy came to you and said, 'I want to travel to the
                    United States,' what books would you give him to read?” I said, “How about
                    Pastures of Heaven?” which is a collection of short stories by John Steinbeck
                    which take place in the Salinas Valley; it is a book that nobody has ever heard
                    of, before or since. It is the one John Steinbeck book that nobody knows; it is
                    a collection of wonderful short stories which I just happened to have read. Then
                    I came up with some book that I had remembered from Sociology 101 on the plight
                    of the urban black in American cities and American societTalley's Corner I guess
                    it was calleand then another book on the United Farm Workers, and then finally
                    some book by Kurt Vonnegut which was a satire on middle AmericI can't remember
                    the name of that book. The one book I just never even thought of was Alistair
                    Cook's America even though it was being reviewed on every TV program and every
                    newspaper at the time. All these books that I had come up with were kind of left
                    wing treatises on how bad American society was, and that was what I suggested
                    giving to these guys to promote America. Anyway, I passed the test.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I went off to graduate school at Eastern Washington University in Cheney.
                    This was a program that was affiliated with the University of Washington School
                    of Public Affairs. They were just getting it started in Cheney and they wanted
                    some people to go there. They offered me some money to go theri.e. a fellowship
                    in economics. The idea was that I would go to Eastern Washington University for
                    a year, do the basic course work in the economics and the political science and
                    then do the second year in Seattle, where I would concentrate on international
                    relations at the master's level. So I went to Cheney, which was a wonderful
                    little place right outside of Spokanin Tom Foley's district at the time, which
                    is another story. I was now five years out of college, so I was closer in age to
                    the professors than I would have been had gone just after graduating from
                    college.</p>
                <p>I established a little basement remodeling business, because some builder had put
                    up a bunch of housea tract development projecand they had left all the basements
                    unfinished. I had my fellowship, and life was good. We lived in a farmhouse. I
                    hobnobbed with the professors. Most of my courses were at night, so I could work
                    during the day. Then the call came. Toward the end of the first semester, the
                    Department called and said, “You number has come up on the roster. Do you want
                    to join the Foreign Service?” I said, “Look, I want to talk to my professors.”
                    The professors said, “Look, we'd really like you to stay. Why don't you call the
                    Department back and see if you can't negotiate a deal so that you can finish
                    your master's program and then enter the Foreign Service after you finish your
                    master's degree.” I called the Department and I talked to some officious
                    bureaucrat in BEprobably just a secretary or receptionist as far as I knew,
                    because I had no idea how the bureaucracy worked at all. I just said, “Look,
                    I'll be more valuable to you if I have my master's degree. What do you think?”
                    The person on the other end said, “Once your name's come up, if you don't accept
                    the offer, we put you on the bottom of the list, so we can't guarantee that
                    we'll ever call you again.” Knowing how difficult it was to pass the test the
                    first time, I wasn't sure that I wanted to take the chance of having to pass it
                    again a second time, so I said, “Okay, I'll take it your offer.”</p>

                <p>WILSON: I entered the Foreign Service in January of 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you sort of feel that the Foreign Service did,
                        and what was the role of the United States abroad at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I suppose what really got me thinking about government service was
                    Watergate. The televising of the Watergate hearings was absolutely fascinating
                    as an exercise in civic education. It occurred at a time when there was not much
                    happening in my life; so I had a fair amount of time to watch and follow it. The
                    hearings were all over the television; so if I wasn't working, then it was easy
                    to turn them on. If I was working, they were always in the newspaper or in the
                    nightly news or whatever. They were absolutely fascinating to watch. If I recall
                    correctly, I probably had my broken leg part of the time, so I was laid up
                    anyway. I broke my leg in January of 1973. I had taken a considerable amount of
                    pride in that in 197we couldn't vote until we were 21, and I turned 21 in 197was
                    the first Presidential election I could vote in,. I had registered Republican so
                    I could go vote against the SOB Nixon twiconce in the primaries and once in the
                    general election, which I did. I broke my leg and the hearings took place. I was
                    watching the hearings and thought, “Gee, this is really fascinating to watch all
                    these guys, including guys that I used to see come by our house.” That got me
                    thinking that perhaps there were some real interesting things to be do. I still
                    didn't know much about Washington. But it also seemed to me that maybe everybody
                    who was doing this stuff in Washington, that maybe they weren't perfect in their
                    assessments and their analysis, and that maybe there were other points of view
                    that could be brought to bear on policy making. I started thinking about how
                    working in the government might be an interesting thing to do, but again it took
                    me awhile to figure out how to get from here to therfrom Lake Tahoe and Santa
                    Barbara, to Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>When I moved to Washington in January of 1976, we lived right over here across
                    the street from the State DepartmenColumbia Plaza apartments. At that time I had
                    no idea what an “in box” or an “out box” was. I had never been in a bureaucracy;
                    I didn't know much about file cabinets. At home, I had a little box with all my
                    files in it. Suddenly the world became a much more complicated place than
                    getting up and driving a few nails and going off to take a few courses and
                    hanging around with a few professors. The A 100 class was a real eye opener in
                    terms of how complicated and different the bureaucracy works.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the A 100 course strike you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think the first few days I felt very inadequate, but I suppose most of
                    the other people did too in that many seemed to have all these great degrees and
                    interesting experiences. Then after the first few days, most of my colleagues
                    seemed either normal or jerks, one or the other. One moves into the stream that
                    one has to swim in and figures out how to do it. I think the A 100 course is
                    really good for getting a bunch of people from disparate backgrounds together
                    and giving everybody both a sense of inadequacy and a sense of sort of common
                    bonds. It was useful in that sense. Our class, I think, was particularly
                    delinquent. We were always late; people wrote letters to the coordinator and
                    said, “These guys will need to shape up if they're going to make it,” and that
                    sort of stuff. We went to the Department of Commerce; most of us spent our time
                    in the aquarium rather than in the meetings. Most of us didn't show up at the
                    Department of Labor's briefings and so on. Occasionally we asked questions that
                    were embarrassing to those who had to answer. The coordinator may have changed
                    the course requirements a little bit, but we seemed to have a pretty good time,
                    and our class did reasonably welas well as other classes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I didn't know anything about Africa. Coming from California, I didn't
                    know very much about African Americans. I had had an African American roommate
                    when I was a senior in high school in Switzerland, and I had some African
                    American friends at UCSB, but I had no particular understanding of Africa. Like
                    most kids my age, geography and history was limited to Europe and occasionally
                    Latin American and maybe, if you're lucky, the Nile and Egypt. During the course
                    of the A 100 class, I had a meeting with my career development officer, who came
                    across as being the guy who was going to look out for my interests in the
                    Foreign Service. I later found out that really he was just the guy making sure
                    that you got round pegs put into round holes. Jesse Clear was his nama labor
                    officer. I went to see him and Jesse said, “Well, what do you want to do?” and I
                    said, “Well, look, I speak French and I've studied French history at university
                    and studied French literature at university, studied French at university, lived
                    in France. It seems to me that it's in the interests of our country that you
                    send me to Paris or Bordeaux or Nice or Marseilles.” He nodded and he said,
                    “Well, son”when he called me 'son,' I knew that I had perhaps made a little bit
                    of a faux pas by talking in terms of the interest of my natiohe said, “Well,
                    son, we've got a place for you. It's a little bit to the south of France, but I
                    think you'll like it. You'll be able to use not just your French but you'll be
                    able to use your carpentry skills there as well. We want to make you the GSO in
                    Niamey, Niger.” I said, “Well, thank you very much. That's very interesting. May
                    I think about it and get back to you?” and he said, “Sure.”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I left his office and I went around the corner to the State Department Library
                    and got out the post report on Niger. First of all, I got out an atlas to figure
                    out where the hell Niger was. Then I got out the post report and took it back to
                    my wife, who looked at it and saw nothing but pictures of camels and mud brick
                    houses and sand. We looked at it; we talked about it; and we decided that this
                    would be our chance to have a National Geographic experience; so we said yes.
                    That is how I got to be an Africanist. I will say that the only thing that I
                    regret about it was Jesse had been less than truthful when he said I could use
                    my carpentry skills, because after you've been in the Sahara Desert, you realize
                    that there's hardly a goddamn tree in the place much less a piece of lumber that
                    you could drive a nail into. I went to Niger as the GSO in May of 1976.</p>
                <p>Q: When most people come into the Foreign Service, they're told there are
                    counselor, political, economic, administrative specialties. They usually don't
                    know anything about these things, but the pecking order will usually tell,
                    “Well, unless you're an economist, you want to be a political officer. Avoid the
                    other two.” Were you getting that from your A 100?</p>
                <p>WILSON: At that time, you had to choose one of the cones. You had take a
                    specialty test. I took the administrative cone part because I had read and
                    learned enough to figure out that it was the easiest cone to get into. I never
                    expected to do this for a lifetime. I just expected to go in and do it for
                    awhile and see the world and have fun and then move on to something else. I
                    figured that, once I got into it, I could then decide where I was going to go. I
                    didn't realize that it was going to be hard to change cones. In my case I never
                    was able to change cones because I never got into a position where I could. I
                    went directly from administration to management. Once you get into management,
                    you couldn't change cones. You had to have an out of cone experience to get
                    that. I never went back to administration; I went the management cone, as DCM or
                    ambassador from 1982 on. So I took the admin cone because I figured that was the
                    easiest way to get an assignment in the Foreign Service, and that was right.</p>
                <p>Once we were in the A 100 course, there were enough bright people who were going
                    to be in different cones that it would have difficult for those who were in the
                    political cone to make a “cone” distinction right thei.e. one cone being better
                    than the others. In fact, those who tried to come across as being better than
                    the rest of us were really quickly cut down to size. We were geographically
                    diverse; we were sufficiently experienced in whatever we had done before that
                    and sufficiently old not to be impressed by somebody who said he was a political
                    officer. Furthermore I am sure we all thought that we could probably change
                    cones much more easily than turned out to be the case.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: 1976 to 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joe, what was Niger like? What were our interests in Niger
                        in 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: As I think I mentioned earlier, when we took a look at the post report,
                    we saw pictures of a lot of camels and lot of sand and a lot of sort of adobe
                    type buildings. For us, it was really the National Geographic experience. I
                    remember flying off to Africa. In those times the Bureau of African Affairs was
                    relatively financially well off; they allowed me, a junior officer, to stop in
                    Dakar and Abidjan on the way to Niger. I had helped in the Bureau with
                    Kissinger's trip to, among other places, Zaire. So I had gotten to know all the
                    people in AF/EX, and they gave me this little travel bonus. I flew into Senegal
                    in one of the old PanAm flights that would start in New York and end in Nairobi,
                    hopscotching across the continent, arriving in Senegal at sun up. In those days
                    the airport was really quite a ways outside the citmaybe 10 miles outside the
                    city. Since then, the city has grown up around the airport. But we arrived in
                    Dakar as the sun was coming up, and I will never forget driving into the city
                    from the airport and watching the Senegalese in their flowing robes, either
                    doing their prayers or walking majestically across the Sahel into town. They
                    were very strikintall, very elegant, very dignified looking people.</p>
                <p>That was my first step on African soil, and I fell magically in love with the
                    continent at that moment. We got to Niger in the middle of May, which is really
                    the very hottest time of the year. I remember stepping out of the airplane and
                    feeling like I'd stepped into a furnace; it was very, very warm. Niger at that
                    time was in the throes of the terrible drought of the 1970s. The drought had
                    been going on for several years, and as a consequence, many of the nomadic
                    tribethe Tuareghad moved into Niamey. You found nomads all over Niamey. The
                    Tuaregs are a much lighter skinned African in their typically either white or
                    blue native wear. They also a different lifestyle from the natives of
                    Niamey.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I must say Niamey lived up to everything we expected. Our expectations were to
                    have a National Geographic experience, and we certainly had that. There was a
                    wonderful game park about two and a half hours south of Niamey called Park W,
                    where we had some Peace Corps volunteers. We had about 150 Peace Corps
                    volunteers throughout the country. So we could go to the game park. We were able
                    to fly into a desert outpost called Bilma. There was a military base where we
                    later helped rehabilitate the landing strip. I flew here one time with the
                    ambassador and when we disembarked, the provincial administrator was there with
                    a bunch of Land Rovers. We got into our Land Rovers and went charging across the
                    desert to Bilma itself, which is an oasis about 45 minutes away. The rules of
                    the game were that you drove as fast as you could across the sand, � la “The Rat
                    Patrol”old television program of that timbut you could never pass the provincial
                    administrator's car in which he and the ambassador were riding. They were
                    driving very fast, so it didn't matter. We would come over the top of the sand
                    dunes and sort of launch off down the other side. We got to the oasis. Bilma in
                    addition to being an oasis with enough water to permit some truck gardening, was
                    the site of a number of salt mines. The people who lived there mined the salt in
                    these big, open pits; they would take the salt out and then they would mold it
                    these molds that looked like a missilsome sort of a big shell. Those salt licks
                    would be loaded onto camels, and taken across the desert in caravans down to
                    Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Niger at that time was governed by a military colonel. His name was Seyni
                    Kountche. Our ambassador, the first ambassador in my career, was Doug Heck, who
                    later went on to head up the Counterterrorism Office and then ended his career
                    in Kathmandu, Nepal. I arrived in May. On the Fourth of July Bicentennial we
                    held a celebration. I was the lowest man on the totem polI was the junior
                    General Services Officer. Because we were having the bicentennial celebration
                    and because it was going to be the first time that the president of the country
                    would attend a national day celebration, all embassy activities were focused on
                    making this a great celebration, including fireworks display. We had to
                    coordinate the fireworks with the local authoritiemilitary authorities. We had
                    an AID officer who was a graduate of the Julliard School in New York and his
                    specialty was music. He was assigned to train the Niger military band on how to
                    play John Philip Sousa marches. I was working with the ambassador to make sure
                    that we the fireworks display went off smoothly and that everything else went
                    fine. I was with the ambassador every day for a couple of hours. We would roam
                    the ambassador's residence and make sure that we had everything in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with Ernie Heck, Ernestine Heck. I've
                        interviewed Ernie. She was a young political officer in Saigon when I was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, Ernie was there. She was the ambassador's wife. She was on leave
                    without pay doing the ambassadorial duties, and of course we worked very closely
                    with her, as one does with an ambassador's spouse when one is General Services
                    Officer. The residence itself was fairly new at the time. It sat on a hill
                    overlooking the Niger River, and across the river you had these mesas and
                    buttes; the view looked like that of the American Southwest with the river sort
                    of winding through this stark countryside. So we had the Fourth of July and it
                    was a huge success, and that pretty much made my stay in Niamey. I wouldn't have
                    had to work another day as long as the Hecks were there. The fireworks went off
                    without a hitch. We had designed the launching systems for the fireworks and
                    they all worked just fine. Since you couldn't test the systems we had designed,
                    we put three different types of launchers on each instrument that we built. As I
                    say, it was the first time anybody had ever seen fireworks in Niger; they were
                    launched over the river. The president came. He had a good time. The band played
                    its John Philip Sousa, and it was a big event.</p>
                <p>During the time I was in Niamey, because of the drought and because of the
                    aftermath of the collapse of Vietnam, USAID was shifting all of its resources
                    out of Southeast Asia and into Africa which became the new development focus. So
                    during the two years that I was there, we doubled the embassy American staff in
                    size each year, which, for a small capital city like Niamey, was a real
                    explosion in expatriate population. Of course, AID came with everything that is
                    required by projectvehicles and these big Chevy Suburbans for these little Niger
                    streets. We made a deal with International Harvester which was trying to make
                    inroads into the African market. AID agreed to buy a lot of their Jeep
                    equivalents and they agreed that they would then maintain them. They ended up
                    with all the Jeeps which they didn't maintain and after a couple of years you
                    had these International Harvester carcasses all over the countryside because
                    they didn't last very long in that climate.</p>
                <p>We ran a number of very interesting projects. I mentioned earlier we had about
                    150 Peace Corps volunteers throughout the country doing everything from national
                    park management to maternal/child health care, school, teaching and building. We
                    had projects designed to improve the production of the national crops, which
                    were millet and sorghum, throughout most of the country. We had projects
                    designed to improve the purchasing of the crops, the storage of the crops, the
                    transport of the cropeverything designed to try and eradicate or try and come to
                    grips with what was perceived at the time, and still is, as a sort of chronic
                    underproduction of food. We had projects designed to stop desertification by
                    planting of trees that grew very quickly and anchored the soil in a number of
                    different places. We had well drilling projects. It was a very interesting time.
                    We dealt with issues that were fundamental to society. At the time I went there,
                    the general conventional wisdom was that the Sahel would not be able to sustain
                    the population that it had, much less the expected population growth. As a
                    couple of people have pointed out, in actual fact in the last 25 or 30 years, it
                    has done reasonably well, perhaps aided by our assistance programs, perhaps
                    aided by the weather, but it has managed to cope by and large with the
                    population growth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I've heard was that by drilling
                        wells, we were changing the migration. Cattle were considered wealth, and
                        rather than keep moving, they tended to sort of congregate around well
                        points. Was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, it was a problem. It was a lesson learned from the well production
                    in the 1960s and early 1970s. The cattle would come, hang around where the wells
                    were, and then they would overgraze the surrounding area. That was a problem. I
                    don't know how they ended up dealing with it in the 1980s or the 1990s, but in
                    my time, it was indeed a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the American interest there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At hat time we had an interest in containing Muammar Qadhafi. We had a
                    humanitarian interests in a population that was underproducing food stocks and
                    which was being ravaged by the effects of the drought. We had an interest in
                    working with the political leaders to improve governance. The war against
                    Qadhafi was really played out more in Chad than it was in Niger. Qadhafi tried
                    to destabilize the Niger government periodically while I was there, including
                    shipping guns in diplomatic bags to be used in Niamey. Those were our political
                    interests. We later, as part of our military assistance program, gave the
                    Nigerians a couple of C130s and, as I said, we rebuilt their airstrip up in the
                    north, up close to the Niger/Libyan border. By and large our policy was driven
                    by foreign assistance and humanitarian assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the French? The French have always been very
                        sensitive in Francophone countries about American involvement? It sounds
                        like we really were involved there. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WILSON: It only became a problem when we would be seen to be intruding in areas
                    that the French felt that they had the lead on. For example, when we were trying
                    to engage in political reform, the French would say, “Well, we will take care of
                    that. We'll do it our way.” In Africa that is a problem that crops up
                    everywhere, particularly in countries where there are valuable resources to be
                    exported and where there are real commercial opportunities. Fundamentalland this
                    goes back even to this timthe French have a view on democratization which
                    maintains that the pace of democratization is keyed much more directly to
                    maintaining public security and should not proceed any faster than that it can
                    be achieved without threatening public security. For us, perhaps because we have
                    fewer interests directly engaged in these countries, we work for democracy now
                    and assume that public security will follow. The one activity where our paths do
                    cross in either competitive or surveillance ways is in the production of
                    uranium, which was just ramping up in Niger when I was there. Of course, uranium
                    implies enrichment, which implies nuclear programs. The French and the Japanese
                    were big clients of the uranium that was being produced in Niger.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they getting the uranium out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were trucking it either across the desert or down through Niamey to
                    the coast. But when we were there, it was just getting started, so there wasn't
                    a whole lot of production. It was the time for discovery of the mines and the
                    building of the infrastructure in the north to take care of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There was some, but not as much as in other countries. I don't remember
                    if they had their own base or if they were just basically integrated as advisors
                    in the Nigerien armed forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They tended to keep a few bases around and move them in

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not when I was there. Kountche was known to be very austere and very much
                    in control. He had come to power in 1974, just before Doug Heck got there. In
                    fact, Doug was en route to post, I think, when the coup took place that brought
                    Kountche to power. When I was there, there was maybe one attempt at changing
                    power, and I think that happened just before I got there in 1986. Kountche was
                    very much the disciplinarian; he was idolized by the armed forces, and the
                    memory of him is very positive and very strong in Niamey.</p>

                        government on contracting for labor and services. How did you find dealing
                        with both the government and the work force of Niger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You make a good point. I've always thought that ambassadors and political
                    officers ignore GSOs at their own peril, because, particularly in the Third
                    World, the landlord class is also the political class. When you only have 10
                    percent of an economy that's monetized, the same people who do politics do
                    leasing of palaces, provision of services, etc. We did in fact have a number of
                    interesting relationships with the chief of protocol of the country, with the
                    senior commercial class and with senior politicians. It was always interesting,
                    at the time that we were there, because due to the rapidity of our build up, our
                    demand outstripped the supply of houses, so would end up essentially entering
                    into short term leases while building our own structures. We would advance all
                    the money; we would have houses built to our specifications; we would be there
                    to supervise the constructiowe would bring people in to make sure that things
                    were done properly. We had a work force there. Because we were doing a lot of
                    construction of houses ourselves, we had a huge work force. A cast of literally
                    hundreds would show up every morning. We'd have to figure out who they all were
                    and send them on their way to do things. Then, of course, at the end of the
                    construction the landlord would come back and say, “Well, now I've got this
                    house; we need to renegotiate the lease.” That made for constant battles with
                    landlords to make sure that we got the best deal possible. We also dealt a lot
                    with various protocol issues related to importing goods. Because Niger was a
                    landlocked country, most of our requisitioned supplies went to Lagos first and
                    then were flown to Niamey by an airline that I think we used to own at one point
                    and later just chartered. It was a classical DC 6 that would fly up once a
                    month. It was a DC 6 that was at the end of its useful life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a four engine plane which won its real fame during
                        the Berlin Airlift in 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. Up until the 1970s and even to the mid 1980s it was still
                    flying around Africa routinely. They had pretty much come to the enthe motors
                    anywaof their useful lives. They used to spew out more oil than one could even
                    imagine their consuming during the course of a flight. The plane would fly up
                    once a month, and we used to work with the customs officials to make sure that
                    they would allow all those goods into the country. So there was always a lot of
                    work with airport customs officials, the in town customs and protocol officials,
                    and immigration officials to get people in and out. That part of it worked
                    pretty well. I think I had a bit of an advantage in that I spoke French and I
                    got along pretty well with the local population.</p>
                <p>One of the major issues that we had was theft. Because we were growing so
                    quickly, we didn't have the systems in place to manage the property very well;
                    so accountability was an always an issue. Getting houses ready for people was
                    always an issue, keeping inventories up to date.</p>

                        background, there was no particular wood to deal with, I guess it was mostly
                        cement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A lot of it was stucccement, cinder blocks, a lot of sand and cement; it
                    was basically cinder block construction. Most people were housed in an area
                    called “The Plateau,” which was the old colonial area. Then they built up a new
                    area called “The Nouveau Plateau.” We were the first ones to start building in
                    that area, which was basically across one of the main road. My own house was
                    across on the other side of the city. We had our recreation association there
                    which had a tennis court and swimming pool and a snack bar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess your experience helped a lot in this construction
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In a lot of ways it was wonderful, because being the hands on supervisor,
                    I had a chance to work with Africans on a daily basis. I had some people who
                    were very close to me, my senior nationals, and we would work through all the
                    various issues that one had to work through, whether it was customs clearance or
                    contracting or property accountability or the motor pool. We hired a lot of
                    people. I had to go back to Niger about four years later as part of a post
                    inspection to check on compliance with the post inspection of two years earlier.
                    I went back up there and realized that a lot of the things that the inspectors
                    had earmarked for correction were things that I had put into place or people I
                    had hired when I had been there. Obviously we were not infallible in what we
                    did; in fact we were pretty much as a staff overwhelmed by the rate of
                    growth.</p>
                <p>The General Services section then, as now, was very much understaffed. It was
                    hard to get people, particularly American supervisors. We didn't have nearly as
                    much American supervision as we needed. Because of the growth of USAID, we put
                    into place what was called a Joint Administrative Office which provided combined
                    administrative support to all elements of the embassy. We had to harmonize our
                    management style and the regulations to take into consideration different
                    agencies, different budgets, different procedures, trying to insure that we had
                    the same standards, and then different accountability procedures. It was pretty
                    complicated. At one time, for the last six or seven months of my tour, there was
                    no administrative officer and I was the only GSO and also acting administrative
                    officer. It was a challenge.</p>
                <p>Q: With this influx coming in of AID people, this can often have sort of an
                    upsetting effect on a small city, a small country. Was this a problem?</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WILSON: Initially it was a problem for USAID. A lot of the people who came out
                    there were people who had come out of Southeast Asia. They had a vision of what
                    their lifestyle as an AID employee ought to be which was based on their
                    experiences in Southeast Asia where they had six or seven servants and had lived
                    in Shangri la type housethey lived in a very tropical setting and everybody was
                    beautiful and everything was relatively clean. They arrived in the Sahel and
                    found out that it wasn't like that at all, and that life was pretty tough and
                    not terribly sanitary, and that the medical facilities were not very good, etc.
                    A lot of these people had to make a real adjustment problem.</p>
                <p>Now, in all fairness, one of the things that they did to complement the career
                    people in the project development process was to hire a lot of former Peace
                    Corps volunteers to do some of the key mid level jobs. That made for a nice mix.
                    They did have some people who were absolutely dedicated to development in the
                    African context; they were not jaded and were not disillusioned by having to
                    move from a relatively plush setting like Southeast Asia to the edge of the
                    Sahara Desert. The frustrations created by the climate were difficult. The Niger
                    government was just as overwhelmed as we were. I think that it is safe to say
                    that for a number of years, just by virtue of the number of Americans who were
                    there and the size and number of our automobiles, we overwhelmed the city of
                    Niamey itself. The General Services operation was located downtown right in the
                    middle of the city; the embassy was just on the outside of town. When I say
                    'city,' there were really two stoplights in the city; that's how small it was.
                    It was maybe a couple hundred thousand people maximum. We would run shuttles
                    back and forth, putting Chevy Suburbans on the road all day every day. They were
                    very visible. We were not inconspicuous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first post. What would a political officer
                        do in Niger?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WILSON: The one political officer we had, did political and consular work. While
                    I was in Niger, three Americans dieall within about a 24 hour period. A kid, a
                    tourist passing through, died of malaria. Then we had an airplane go dowa cargo
                    flight bringing in cigarettes. It had an American crew of four, and two of them
                    died. The consular officer and I, as backup consul, had responsibility for
                    taking care of dead American citizens, so that occupied us at that time. The
                    consular officer was a bit squeamish. There were no embalming facilities in
                    Niger. We tried to get the Peace Corps doctor to help us embalm the bodies, but
                    he would have nothing to do with that. We looked up in the regulations, to see
                    whether we could figured how one ships an unembalmed body back to the United
                    States in a way that is both safe and consistent with U.S. rules and
                    regulations. It was a very complicated procedure. One of the things that the
                    regulations suggest that you do if you don't have embalming facilities or can't
                    get the embalming done, is to wrap the body in a formaldehyde soaked shroud. So
                    we went down to the morgue which had only six places, six iceboxes, and we used
                    three of them during this fairly extended period. It was almost eight or nine
                    days before we put our procedure together. Finally, we went to deal with these
                    bodies, got them out, put them on the slab, and the poor consular officer said,
                    “I'll go do the paperwork. You handle this.” He just couldn't do it. I had a
                    Nigerien come in to help me. He smelled the formaldehyde, took one look at me,
                    and said, “You crazy mazungu,” which is 'white man,' and left. So I was left
                    with these bodies; I manhandled them as best as I could and tried to wrap them
                    up in these formaldehyde soaked shrouds; that took a couple of hours. All the
                    while, we had a guy outside the morgue building the coffins on a couple of
                    sawhorses. We had to have zinc lined, lead sealed coffins with a filtration
                    system because in the heat you've got the expanding gases which needs a way to
                    be released. Otherwise the casket could explode. In fact, one did in Chaone of
                    the legends is that the embassy tried to ship the body back to the States in a
                    luggage compartment and the casket blew up. We didn't want that to happen to us.
                    The builder of the coffins was a Belgian, about five six and rotund, who wore a
                    beret. He had a classic one piece of hair that went from one side of his head
                    all the way over to the other side. He always had a cigarette hanging out of his
                    mouth; he was a very strange looking fellow, not the sort of fellow that one
                    would in any walk of life want to spend a lot of time with, which is maybe why
                    he was the local coffin maker. We managed to wrap up the bodies and put them in
                    coffins for shipment to the U.S.</p>
                <p>Other than that, the political officehe was the political/economic/consular
                    officewould write economic reports. We would do our annual foreign economic
                    trends report. At that time you would chart how much foreign assistance was
                    coming in, what the status of the uranium projects were, etc. We would do our
                    general political reporting on what was going on in town, who was in, who was
                    out, who was doing what to whom. Then he would handle the consular work and he
                    would travel around the country to sponsor self help projects, using the
                    ambassador's little fund money to bestow on worthwhile activities, small
                    activities, throughout the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The political/economic/counselor was the job I wanted. I thought that he was up
                    in a second floor office, right across from the ambassador's; he was not getting
                    sweaty and dirty every day; that looked pretty good to me. The embassy was going
                    to reassign me. The deputy and the ambassador said, “We want you to come up and
                    do this for the second tour. It would mean something like an excursion tour that
                    you get as a first tour officer now.” But then the Bureau's executive director
                    said, “You can't do that, because we won't be able to fill the GSO job. It's
                    much easier to fill a political job than it is to fill the GSO job, and so long
                    as we've got this sucker down here, we've got to keep him there.” So they
                    did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the first part of the Carter
                        Administration. Did human rights play any role, or were you away from

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Human rights played a role, but we were still trying to figure out how a
                    country goes from a one party systems that were all over Africa to a multi party
                    system. So the lag time between the commitment to human rights and the real
                    changing of human rights policies in a number of African countries was
                    considerable. There has been a lot of progress on the human rights front in
                    Africa, for all of its problems, but at that time you didn't really see it,
                    other than maybe just some increased sensitivity to it at some levels. It gave
                    us some ammunition to talk to the government about things like the imprisonment
                    of the journalists who were writing against the government, but we were not yet
                    geared up to talk about free press in the context of having more than one
                    government newspaper, or things like that.</p>

                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were coming up against the French. The French attitude, as I said
                    earlier, was, 'Yes, we believe democracy is a good thing, but we need to go at a
                    pace that they can live with and which won't cause instability. Besides,
                    Kountche is our friend and our national interests are much more geared toward
                    stability in Niger than they are for one man/one vote.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and your wife find the social life beyond sort
                        of the intra American community with the Nigerians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The Nigerians don't invite people out very much, especially to their
                    homes. Part of it, I think, is the difference in lifestyles. They could never
                    really entertain you in the way that you could entertain them. They live much
                    more modestly obviously. But in terms of just a social life generally, we were
                    very active. We were active through the recreation association, of which I was
                    president for two years. We revitalized it; we opened up the membership to
                    others than just American citizens, so that we had an international membership.
                    It became the place for the international community to go on a Friday night. We
                    started a bunch of interesting activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>As I indicated, we spent a lot of time traveling. We would meet the missionary
                    community and Peace Corps volunteers throughout the country. We had a number of
                    Nigerien friends and contacts through my GSO activitiee.g. the landlord claswe
                    would entertain them. That was a challenge because oftentimes if they would come
                    they would not necessarily bring their wives, but rather their girlfriends; they
                    would come late; there would be no shows. We could quite never figure out why
                    they behaved this way. But certainly in terms of entertaining, we did quite a
                    bit; we had a lot of activities including the Nigerians. Towards the end of our
                    tenure, we started getting invitations from people who liked us and wanted to
                    invite us before we left. That was very nice. When it happened, it was always a
                    real privilege to be invited into somebody's home to break bread with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1978. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I left in 1978. We had traveled to Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin and Upper
                    Volta. I had a Toyota Land Cruiser. We had enjoyed all of West Africa, but we
                    did not include it when we submitted our wish list for places to be assigned. We
                    basically wanted to go to Indiat the time I still thought of the Foreign Service
                    as a way to see the worlso we put down Madras and Bombay and Delhi. We listed
                    five posts; everybody had said that since we had served in a hardship post in
                    Niger, we would really have a priority in getting what we wanted the next time
                    around. India was still considered a hardship post, so we didn't think we would
                    have to fight to get there. I got a cable in December before anybody had had a
                    chance to review my wish list, offering me the job as administrative officer in
                    Lome, Togo. I had joined the Foreign Service to see the world, and my first two
                    tours were going to be within about 800 miles of each. I said “Yes.” The way
                    that the cable was phrased, you couldn't say no. It was, “We want to offer you a
                    job that is both professionally challenging and career enhancing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Personnel. You learn these phrases. And it
                        probably made sense too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It would be challenging; it would be career enhancing. We had very much
                    liked Lome. We had been there and we had been entertained by the administrative
                    officer. He had a nice house a block from the ocean with a rooftop terrace. The
                    Togolese are very nice people, and it was a pretty country. So we thought about
                    it for the requisite 30 seconds and went back and said, “Professionally
                    challenging and career enhancing, sounds like my kind of job.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Togo from 1978 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WILSON: I left in 1979; I was there about a year and a half. My wife got very
                    sick; so we had to curtail our tour and go back to Washington for a while. But
                    Togo was wonderful. It was much more manageable. The AID mission was stable; it
                    wasn't growing. President Gnassingbe Eyadema was a very interesting character.
                    He's still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Gnassingbe Eyadema. At that time Eyadema liked to style himself as one of
                    America's chief friends in an otherwise Soviet leaning Africa. He tried to make
                    the case that Togo was a bastion of pro Western thought and action in an
                    otherwise leftist world. At that time the Togolese practiced a rather liberal
                    economy philosophy relative to its neighbors.</p>
                <p>Ghana was a complete disaster. The Ghanian currency was worthless. Benin was not
                    far behind. Both countries were in the clutches of socialist dictatorships.
                    Eyadema was a right wing dictatohe was our kind of dictator. All the transport
                    for the landlocked countries came through TogLome, which had great port
                    facilities. So Togo had an abundance of supplies, and low import taxes, making
                    everything relatively inexpensive. Togo, as a former German colony, also had
                    great beer, had the best beer in west Africa. So it was great. Our house was a
                    block from the ocean; we had the ocean breezes to cool uI used to get up every
                    morning and go to the ocean to body surf for an hour and then run back up the
                    beach. There always was a great current going east. I would body surf and then
                    run home every morning about six o'clock; it was always a good way to wake
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I first got there, it was Ron Palmer, who was about Eyadema's size
                    and very gregarious. He and Eyadema used to fly to a town north of Lome together
                    to watch traditional wrestling. They got along very well. My second ambassador
                    was just the complete opposite. Her name was Marilyn Johnson. She had been a
                    USIA officevery petite, a lady of a certain age, very refined. Ron was also a
                    very bright guy and very well read, but he was a little bit coarser and little
                    bit more gregarious. Marilyn was almost the exact opposite. She was about as
                    opposite from Ron as you could possibly get and still be a human being. They
                    were both very talented in their own ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>It was an interesting period in Togo. The Togolese economy was flourishing
                    relative to its neighbors' economies. It was a peaceful place. We had a big
                    Peace Corps program. The Peace Corps loved it. There was a lot of interaction.
                    The Togolese from the coast spent a lot of time in the States. A lot of
                    Americans had come and stayed in Togo. Right as I was leaving and thereafter, a
                    number of American companies were looking to invest in Togo. The Togolese, in
                    order to enhance their image and open up to the West, dropped their visa
                    requirements and opened up an office in Washington to promote tourism and
                    investment. It was really a good time. There was a lot of building going on in
                    Lome. So it was a good time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at a time sort of going back to one's roots for
                        many of the American blacks. Did you see many American blacks going to Togo
                        to take a look at...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not very much. Most of them would go to Ghana. I don't remember when
                    Roots came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a little earlier but close to that, 1975 or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Most of the African Americans were going to The Gambia, some to Senegal,
                    and a lot to Sierra Leone and to Ghana. The trouble with going to Togo was that
                    you pretty much had to speak French; that reduced potential visitors a lot. We,
                    however, were one of the first operations of Leon Sullivan's international NGO,
                    and therefore had a lot of its staff there. They were doing an agricultural
                    project in the interior of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Togo sort of one of these countries that was cut with
                        tribes on both sides of the area, spillover tribes, or is there pretty much
                        tribal unity there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The tribal structure in West Africa goes north to south. So you get a lot
                    of the same tribes along the coast. The coastal tribes, the Ewe and the Mina,
                    have ties to their tribal members in Ghana and Benin. The further north you get,
                    you run into a different group; in Togo they call them Kabre; they were the ones
                    who were in power. They have stayed in power, and I think that the longer
                    they've been in power, the more they have come to dominate the south; they have
                    created a lot of antipathy on the part of the southerners and created a lot of
                    the problems which still exist. So the country is stratified with coastal tribes
                    and the interior tribes. The further north you go, the more different ethnic
                    groups can be found. So Togo was not an ethnically homogenous country. In fact,
                    with the exception of maybe Botswana or Equatorial Guinea, there are very few
                    actually homogenous countries in West Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>After World War I the French became the colonial power. Franz Josef Strauss, the
                    old Bavarian German politician, used to come down to Toghe and Eyadema got along
                    real welto go hunting and partying and what not. But by and large it was the
                    French who were running everythinthe port facility and commerce and all the
                    trading relationships went up through Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy and our American activities running at
                        cross purposes with the French, or was it working pretty well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At that time, it was working pretty well. We saw much more commonality in
                    our interests than we saw potential conflict. The French would bridle a bit at
                    our cultural center and some of our cultural programs. They never liked the
                    Peace Corps very much. They were leery oAmericans throughout the country and
                    they watched what they were doing. They didn't like the idea that Americans
                    might be teaching English to Francophone natives because of their belief in the
                    superiority of Francophony French. But by and large we got along pretty well
                    with them. There were not any real issues there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues that absorbed us in Togo
                        other than maintaining good relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No; we just wanted to maintain good relations. We thought Togo was a
                    paragon of democracy in an otherwise socialist part of Africif not democracy, at
                    least economic growth and stability. Togo was pretty much a success story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets messing around there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, the Soviets were in Benin and in Ghana. There must have been an
                    embassy, but I don't recall it. We didn't really run into the Soviets very much
                    until we got to Burundi a few years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the neighbors like Benin or Ghana try to mess
                        around in Togo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There were always tensions between Ghana and Togo, but at that time they
                    were pretty much under control. There would be occasion when we had border
                    incidents; everybody would try and say that country was destabilizing the other.
                    But it never got beyond that. As far as Benin goes, Kerekou was in power as the
                    dictatonot as the elected president. Benin Togo relations were not real good but
                    they weren't bad. Togo basically benefitted from the chaos in the other two
                    countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being administrative officer? Was this
                        professionally challenging and career enhancing as it had been touted to
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was career enhancing! I got two promotions while in Niger, and then I
                    got another promotion right after I left Togo. That made three promotions in
                    three and a half years; so in terms of enhancing, I think it worked out just
                    fine. I enjoyed being an administrative officer. I had more control over the
                    budget function. That was the big thing. As GSO, I basically executed; as
                    administrative officer I planned and controlled funds.</p>
                <p>We had an American school in Togo. I was on the board of that school which was a
                    lot of fun. I had the best office in the embassy. Mine was the only office that
                    had a view of the ocean; as a Californian I appreciated that. I had good staff.
                    The Togolese were talented people. The size of the mission was stable; we didn't
                    have this great burst of staff growth when I was there. It was all very
                    civilized. The country was stable and at peace.</p>
                <p>The AID mission was very small under good leadership. We used to meet all the
                    time and sort out our differences. The USIS operation was right across the
                    street; it also was small so everything manageable. I think the U.S. government
                    had very good little operation in Togo and I enjoyed it. I think most of all I
                    enjoyed the Togolese. The people who worked at the embassy had been there for a
                    long time and knew what they were doing. We had State specialists coming through
                    on a regular basis who worked with them, particularly on the budget and fiscal
                    matters. It was a good, professionally run, efficient operation and didn't
                    suffer from the chaos of bursting at the seams as we had in Niamey.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Washington was pretty good to me. I basically learned early on that if
                    you enjoyed their confidence, then you could do pretty much what you wanted. The
                    same people who were in Washington when I first went out to Niamey were still
                    there; they were very supportive. They wanted the mission to succeed. The AF/EX
                    people in particular were particularly concerned that the mission succeed; they
                    always gave me a full hearing.</p>
                <p>

                <p>WILSON: We had a number of different support operations. The budget and fiscal
                    operations went through a regional center. We had a regional budget fiscal
                    officer in Ghana who used to visit and we had a regional personnel officer

                    would come out from Washingtothe post management officer and otherbut we had no
                    regional administrative office to whom we reported. The administrative operation
                    was run by me, and I reported to the ambassador and the DCM.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that people in Ghana, for example, because
                        of the lousy rule they had there all the time, would sort of enjoy coming
                        down to Togo and enjoy a certain amount of stability in an R&amp;R
                        place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They used to come down a lot. We had two or three really good hoteltwo
                    were right on the beach. We would have people from Ghana all the time. During
                    the time that I was in Togo, the Ghanaians engaged a major U.S. accounting
                    firm/investment bank to come to restructure their Ministry of Finance. These
                    guys, including Theodore Roosevelt IV, were in Togo for the weekend when the
                    Ghanaians closed their border and stole their money. They took all their
                    currency and exchanged it for new CDs. This investment bank/accounting firm that
                    was supposed to be restructuring the Ministry of Finance didn't have a clue that
                    this was going to happen. The Ghanaians kept it a closely guarded secret. So
                    these guys ended up having to stay in Togo for 10 days while the Ghanaians did
                    their thing. They were probably our best known guys who were stuck outside of
                    Ghana during that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any crises like people dying or things like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Actually we did. We had a Peace Corps volunteer who had a motorcycle
                    accident upcountry. She had her wound, which was a knee wound, wrapped by a
                    Polish doctor; she was then brought down to Lome. Her injury got infected with
                    gangrene, and we were fighting to get a medevac plane. While we were doing that,
                    the meds were basically having to go in every day or so and cut off another part
                    of her leg as the gangrene spread. She finally died, which was real tough on all
                    of us and especially the Peace Corps people. When my wife gave birth in the
                    States to my first set of twins in May of 197just a couple months after the
                    Peace Corps volunteer had dieshe also caught gas gangrene in an American
                    hospital in California. It was a very strange coincidence having seen a gangrene
                    infection happen in Togo and then suddenly being faced with it again in
                    California.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Togo is part of that corner of West Africa that has the highest rate of
                    twin births in the world. All my twins were conceived in Togo, as I like to
                    remind my African friendit is the waters of West Africa that brought me first
                    one set in 1979 and then 21 years later a second set of twins. We didn't know we
                    were having twins. My wife would go in to the doctor in Lome every couple of
                    months, and he would look at her and say, “Gee, you're awfully big. Are you
                    about seven months pregnant?” She said, “No, I'm only four months pregnant.” He
                    said, “Well, you're awfully big.” He was a German doctor, but they didn't do
                    sonograms or anything like that in Togo in 1979. We flew her back when she was
                    seven months pregnant. She called me up and said, “You're not going to believe
                    this. We are having twins.” So I literally did not know for the first seven
                    months. When I heard this news, I changed my plans and went back to the States;
                    my wife gave birth literally the day I got back. I got off the airplane in LA;
                    we went to see a movie, and she went into labor that night. So I ended up being
                    up for about four days in a row, traveling, across continents and oceans and
                    then sitting through a movie and delivery. She gave birth to the twins and got
                    very sick. She almost died. She was in the hospital for about six weeks. They
                    thought she was going to die. They gave her about a one in 10 chance of
                    survival. They flew her by helicopter to various hospitals. At that time they
                    didn't have a lot of hyperbaric chambers around. Finally they got her into one
                    in Long Beach; she survived to my great relief. As a consequence of emergency,
                    we had to curtail our tour in Togo, which was too bad. I liked Togo, and I liked
                    the job and the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1979 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In 1979, we came back to Washington and I became the administrative
                    officer for the Bureau of African Affairs. The job was responsible for insuring
                    that there were sufficient interagency resources put at the disposal of the
                    Bureau of African Affairs, both money and positions. We were fighting for
                    positions for the joint administrative offices to support State and other agency
                    activities. We were hammering out all these agreements with the other agencies
                    to make sure we got adequate funds transferred to our account and that people to
                    work in these joint offices were transferred to our payroll. I worked on the
                    assignment of all officers in the Bureau; so I was the liaison with the Office
                    of Personnel for the assignments of people to African posts, everything from the
                    DCMs down to the junior officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from 1979 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the African Bureau rate in those days in its
                        ability to get money, people, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WILSON: The Bureau did very well. We always managed to get everything we needed
                    and then some. Africa was looked upon with favor because it was understood to be
                    more difficult than any other region. At that time, we were being squeezed a
                    little bit by the principle of universality, which required that we keep an
                    embassy open in every country just because it was independent. But the squeeze
                    was not very great. We were able to defend it basically on Kennedy principle
                    dating back to the 1960s when the U.S. made the decision that any country that
                    was sovereign would be treated as a sovereign country and would have an American
                    embassy and an ambassador; by and large we did that.</p>
                <p>We did very well in the money game. We always had a lot of money. We did very
                    well on staffing. We had a lot of people who earned their stripes in Africa;
                    they started there, served two or three tours there, and then moved on. At that
                    time you were rewarded for taking initiatives in Africnot punished. I remember
                    one time in Niamey we built a tennis court, and even though it cost more than
                    $25,000, it seemed like the thing to do at the time. The inspectors came through
                    and said, “Gee, this was a great idea.” Had they come through 10 years later,
                    they would have put the administrative officer and everybody in jail, I'm quite
                    sure. We used the wrong kind of funding source for this project; we usethis is
                    very arcanFAS operating funds for an FBO property, for example. You just don't
                    do that.</p>
                <p>Q: You didn't call it a helicopter landing...</p>
                <p>WILSON: No; I think we were very straight up about it. We just said that we had
                    to do this. Niamey was a difficult post, and people deserved to have a tennis
                    court. The guy that masterminded it, was a guy by the name of Wayne Swedenburg,
                    who was a very senior administrative officer, and we just made it happen. The
                    field had that autonomy and freedom in those days, and we had the luxury of
                    having enough money to operate with. We could get things done very quickly and
                    with a minimum of bureaucracy. I think those were the golden days are now
                    gone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with AID? Sometimes AID is able to get
                        more money or have a different set of procedures which seem to enable their
                        people to live a little better than those in Department's Foreign Service.
                        Was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was always a problem. It was always horrible. AID was so much bigger
                    than State in a lot of these posts; so you always had sort of competition
                    between the AID director and the ambassador. I remember in Niger a couple of
                    years after I left; Jim Bishop went out our ambassador; Jay Johnson was the AID
                    director. Jay picked him up at the airport. Jay had already been there for about
                    five or six years, and quite literally as they were driving into town, Jay said
                    to the new ambassador, “I just want you to know that that tennis court at the
                    residence was bought with FAS funds and so it's open to everybody.” I'm not sure
                    I would have put it quite that way had I been the director, but that's the way
                    he put it. That became the stuff of legend, as Jim Bishop fumed at being told
                    this on the way in from the airport. AID had different rules and regulations on
                    allocation of vehicles, for example; so you would have mid level AID employees
                    riding around in official vehicles, while the State employees couldn't do that.
                    The centralization of administration services was designed to get at the
                    disparities in services; the idea was that if you had one administrative
                    structure and if operated by one set of rules, you would not have then the
                    disparities in services. It didn't always work perfectly well. It probably
                    worked better than if you had had three or four different sets of rules and
                    regulations, but it wasn't perfect by any means. AID employees were different
                    then from what they might be now. They had served in a different part of the
                    world where the lifestyle was considerably different and probably considerably
                    more luxurious that it was in West Africa. They came to West Africa thinking
                    that they could replicate the lifestyle that they had had in Southeast Asia,
                    only to find that they couldn't. They really would complain a lot to try to see
                    if they could. We in the administrative section were put in a position having to
                    tell them “no;” that was always interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular posts that stick out in your mind while you
                        were serving in Washington, or any particular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The one thing that I have always been struck by is the extent to which
                    you see the same problems in the same posts decade after decade after decade. So
                    in Niamey it was always the property accountability. In Togo it might have been
                    something else; in Brazzaville it might have been something else, but we would
                    always end up sort of seeing the same problems time and time again. When I was
                    in Togo, I had been sent to reopen Brazzaville in 1978; I spent about two and a
                    half or three weeks there doing that. That was a great opportunity. We had done
                    everything. We had been able to spend several hundred thousand dollars in a
                    couple week period doing thingeverything from making curtains for the chancery
                    to building a swimming pool at what we then turned into the recreation center.
                    When I went there six years later as Deputy Chief of Mission, I found that not
                    only were many of the same personalities there, but many of the same issues that
                    we had tried to deal with then were still there. While in Washington, we spent a
                    lot of time on redoing Lancaster House in Harare...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. It was trying to effect the transition from a white regime
                    to a black regime essentially. That was an ongoing issue. We had the Liberian
                    coup that brought Sammy Doe to power. That was very difficult because there were
                    a lot of deaths that took place. At that time, there was a large vocal Liberian
                    American community that made their concerns known to us. We spent a lot of time
                    worrying about the evacuation of American citizens, worried about things going
                    bad, going from bad to worst.</p>
                <p>I was in Washington at the end of the Carter administration; so a lot of what was
                    going on in Africa was overshadowed by the hostage crisis in Iran. As is so
                    often the case, you operate in Africa somewhat below the political radar screen
                    here in WashingtoLiberia and Lancaster House being the two exceptions to that
                    rule. Lancaster HousZimbabwe independenchappened just before the Carter
                    Administration went out. It happened in 1980. That was a high moment for
                    everybody. We were able to get Vice President Mondale to go to Africa in July,
                    June or July. I advanced that trip in Senegal, and I worked on the visit to
                    Niamey, and then I went to Lagos, Nigeria, and worked the last part of the trip.
                    That was a lot of fun. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Mondale work out? Did he follow his
                        brief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, he was pretty good. The only time I really saw him was in Niamey. I
                    saw the delegation in Nigeria, but I didn't see much of Mondale. In Niamey I was
                    one of the lead people out of Washington and I spent some time seeing Mondale
                    and the delegation. He was pretty good. There was the meshwe where they roast
                    goats and lambs. They serve the meat on a spit; you would go to tear the meat
                    from the carcass itself, or in Mondale's case, somebody did that for him. There
                    was the ceremonial grabbing of the first piece. You would get a bucket of water
                    and you would put your hand to clean it; then you take the goat off the spit and
                    eat it, and then you put your hand in back in the bucket for another cleaning.
                    They brought the bucket over to Mondale, and he rolled up both sleeves and put
                    both hands in the bucket and scrubbed himself like a surgeon up to about the
                    elbow and then went at it. He was in good spirit.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Unfortunately they insisted on putting him in the presidential guest house, which
                    had a horrible double bed which was only really about a bed and a half. It was
                    not built for somebody of Mondale's size; it sagged in the middle very badly.
                    I'm sure he didn't sleep very well. As Air Force II was landing we got a phone
                    call to the effect that the plumbing, the pipes, right above the bed had burst.
                    There wasn't anybody in Niamey who was going to do anything about it. They were
                    all out at the airport to see the Vice President of the United States arrive. We
                    had to send our embassy team to the guest house to repair the pipes and change
                    the bedding and clean up. I didn't inspect the work myself, but it got done.</p>
                <p>I was involved with the other guest house that housed the congressional
                    delegation as well and the people Mondale had with him. I remember going around
                    and noting that there were no toilet seats on any of the toilets. This was going
                    to be a problem for our delegation which was accustomed to having toilet seats.
                    So we had to go around and pull toilet seats out of every American house's guest
                    bathroom, move them into this guest house so that these people had toilet seats
                    to sit on. Unfortunately the screws for the toilet seats we had in the American
                    houses didn't match up very well with the holes in the toilets that were at the
                    guest house; that required considerable improvisation so that the Americans who
                    were on this trip would have toilet seats to sit on when they went to the
                    bathroom. It was all fun.</p>
                <p>When I got to Niamey, I commandeered a mobilette. I went and talked to Jim Bishop
                    and said, “What do you want me to do? “ I said, “I need some transportation. The
                    motor pool is stretched thin and taxis are next to impossible to get.” I said I
                    would like to take the mobiletta little motor bike. So I wheeled around Niger
                    for five or six days on this mobilette buying all the food for the congressional
                    delegation and all that sort of stuff. I was supervising, honchoing a lot. It
                    was like being GSO agaihad a great time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1981, a new administration came in. Were you there
                        during the transition between the Carter and Reagan Administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>: As the Carter administration was drawing to a close, we had a rover team in
                    South Africa which had uncovered what they thought was some fraud on the part of
                    the GSO there. What he had done was to set up double accounts for all local
                    providers in town; he had given them purchase orders for furniture,
                    refrigerators, appliances, etc. and had made out the purchase orders for too
                    much money. The suppliers would then bill the embassy for the amount shown on
                    the purchase order and then give him kickbackthe difference between the phony
                    and the real costs. In this way, he was able to get several sets of furniture
                    put in the own barn next to his house. He had purchased a house in South Africa
                    because he was planning to retire there. He then he had leased the house to the
                    US government even though he had been told he couldn't do that. Anyway, it was a
                    real mess. I was asked to go to South Africa to serve as administrative
                    counselor, supervising the administrative functions of the embassy and the three
                    consulates. I went in 1981 which was just at the time of the transition in
                    Washington; I was basically transitioning out myself. I arrived in South Africa
                    on January 4th, I guess it was. I had left Washington on January 1st or
                    something like that. Right about that time, President Reagan was giving an
                    interview and somebody asked him a South African question which was, “What are
                    you going to do about South Africa and the apartheid regime?” President Reagan
                    said, “Well, gee, South Africa is an important country. It's been an ally of
                    ours in every war we've ever fought. It's got a lot of mineral resources, and
                    we'll just have to deal with it.” The South Africans, of course, interpreted
                    that to mean four more years for apartheid. So when we got there, the South
                    Africans were euphoric. They thought Reagan was the best thing since sliced
                    bread. In terms of dealing with the transition in Washington, we were
                    responsible for preparing all the papers on budget, staffing, procurement
                    sources, and for compiling all the issues' briefs for the incoming
                    administration. But I left before Chet Crocker had been named as assistant
                    secretary. Dick Moose was still the assistant secretary when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Dick Moose? He had been in charge of
                        management in the Department and there are people who are critical of his
                        management style and all that. I was wondering how you found him from your
                        perspective as administrative man under Dick Moose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Dick Moose had a good AF/EX director who later, I think, had to plead
                    guilty to some misdemeanor, maybe some felony, dealing with some irregularities
                    in the Bureau, but he was a buffer between me and the assistant secretary. Moose
                    would call me when he wanted to talk about people being assigned to African
                    posts on other issues that I handled. I traveled with Dick on one trip down and
                    I spent a lot of time with him. I made Dick and Tony latthe two guys on whom I
                    actually spent a lot of time making sure that they were squared away while on
                    this trip. Moose has always been an interesting guy. He's very bright. I don't
                    think that he had a management style that was suitable to the job, but he was
                    surrounded by people who were very good managers and who understood how the
                    bureau really functioneprincipally Bill Harrop, who was his senior deputy and
                    who made the bureau run. Bill was one of the finest people that I've every
                    know.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Absolutely. It helped a lot to have Bill as the senior deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in South Africa from 1981 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I arrived there in January of 1981 and I left in July of 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in South Africa when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I got there, in terms of politics, the apartheid regime was firmly
                    ensconced. The regime thought that it had free rein from the American
                    administration and that there was not going to be much pressure brought to bear
                    by the Americans. At the embassy the ambassador and the DCM had been sorely
                    embarrassed by this scandal on their watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the GSO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: This was the GSO who had been accused, and was later indicted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anything happen? There's not a very good history of
                        following through and putting people in jail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In his case, he was indicted, and there is still an outstanding warrant
                    for his arrest. But there is no extradition treaty with South Africa that covers
                    his crime. He retired, and my understanding is that because he was never been
                    convicted, the Department never bothered to stop his pension. He retired in
                    South Africa and has collected his pension ever since; I understand he's still
                    alive. It is now 20 years later; he was 63 then, so he must 83 or 84 now. But
                    the Justice Department and the State Department are still trying to get him. I
                    think he's actually taken on South African nationality or he has got a long term
                    residence permit and the South Africans are leaving him alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that he was an embarrassment? Were you
                        untangling things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WILSON: I spent most of my time untangling things and just putting the operation
                    back in some sort of order. We rationalized the way we did management there. We
                    put procurement under control and put everything back in the right warehouse. We
                    had installed some accountability and we basically tried to insure that there
                    was some integrity in the operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Bill Edmonson was the ambassador when I first got there; he was there for
                    about my first year; Herman Nickel arrived just before he left. The deputy was
                    Howard Walker, who went on to be ambassador to Togo and then Madagascar. Our
                    embassin Pretoriat that time was on two floors of the same building that housed
                    the South Africa police. We were basically in hostile territory in a building
                    that was occupied by some offshoot of the South African security apparatus,
                    right downtown. It was an interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as our embassy is concerned, I would think there
                        would be considerable discomfort by being cheek by jowl with the
                        police.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At that time the South Africans had a great way of basically seducing
                    Americans. They are fundamentally nice folks so long as you don't start talking
                    about their “caffer” problem. They like to have barbecues; they like to
                    entertain; they're very jovial and they're very friendly, and so to a certain
                    extent they're very seductive for Americans. We didn't have a lot of African
                    Americans there; we lived pretty much in white communities, so to a certain
                    extent we didn't have the feeling that we were in hostile territory unless you
                    had, as I did, a lot of employees who were Africans who lived in segregated
                    townships. Then you saw the situation somewhat differently. This was the time
                    when we were just at the beginning of constructive engagement. Up until that
                    time been focused principally on Lancaster House.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Our ambassador and our DCM were concerned about the politics of South Africa, but
                    it hadn't yet translated into the same sort of hostility as we got later when we
                    moved to imposing sanctions on the apartheid regime.g. disinvestment, etc. In
                    terms of working in the same building as the South African police, you didn't
                    really have any sense of their presence. You didn't see a lot of uniformed South
                    African police. It was basically where the bureaucracy was housed. Later on,
                    there was a bomb that went off next to the building. Then we finally got FBO to
                    agree to provide the money necessary to move the embassy to a more secure place.
                    Interestingly, if you talk to people who had been in South Africa in the 1950s
                    and come back in the 1960s or in the 1970s, they would tell you about the
                    demonstrable progress the blacks had made in the intervening years. They had
                    gone from having to step off the sidewalks when a white was on the sidewalk, to
                    actually manning the cash registers in stores and actually being allowed to shop
                    in some stores as well. So there had been an evolution in South African society,
                    not nearly enough and not nearly fast enough obviously. Pretoria was probably
                    the most conservative of all the cities in which we had representation; Cape
                    Town probably the most liberal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were stationed in Pretoria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was in Pretoria, but we also had responsibility for three consulates,
                    Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban. The embassy moved down to Cape Town for six
                    months every year, because that was where the legislature was. So when the
                    legislature was in session, the embassy would move there. The ambassador and the
                    DCM and political officer as well as a few others would move to Cape Town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As administrative officer, you were dealing with an
                        essentially black work force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I had a black work force. I had a white landlord class.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that you would have been a very good source for telling
                    it the way it was as opposed to political officers who are pretty well trapped
                    with the political class. Did you find yourself sort of a source of 'well,
                    here's the way it really is?'</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WILSON: The political counselor at the time was Dennis Kehoe, who was later
                    killed in Namibia, and the political officer was Reid Hendrick, who is now
                    deputy chief of mission, I think, in The Hague; he is a very good friend of
                    mine. In fact, both of them were very good friends of mine. Dennis was also a
                    father of twins, so we had that in common. Dennis and I used to work pretty
                    close together. Dennis and Reid and I would talk all the time. When we started
                    working on “constructive engagement,” which was in April of 1971, when Chet had
                    been appointed but not yet confirmed and when Eliot Abrams had been appointed
                    but not yet confirmed. Bill Clark, Judge Clark, had been confirmed as Deputy
                    Secretary and he came out to South Africa. Dennis and I worked together on that
                    trip. I handled the logistics and Dennis provided the substance in the briefing
                    papers. Interestingly, the South Africans tried to get Judge Clark to go to
                    Namibia. They commandeered the motorcade that he was in. Instead of taking him
                    to where we thought he was going, they took him to the airport and tried to
                    bundle him on an airplane. Dennis had gotten split from the motorcade, so that
                    he was not at the airport as the South Africans were telling the Judge that he
                    was going to get on. The Judge, to his great credit, said, “No, I'm not getting
                    on the airplane; I'm not going to one of the bases in Namibia.” The foreign
                    minister or some other high official turned to him and said, “But you have to.
                    We've already flown the band out there.” But the Judge, to his great credit,
                    didn't get on the airplane. He did not succumb to that. The South Africans were
                    running operations in Angola out of Namibia which meant that in addition to
                    keeping Namibia occupied, they were also running operations in support of Jonas
                    Savimbi and his UNITA. The trip did not take place.</p>
                <p>Dennis, Reid and I worked very closely together. They were very interested in
                    knowing my staff better. They wanted to know about the townships that they'd
                    been in. My staff basically reported to them on what the Africans would think
                    about various issues. At that time, we didn't have that much structured contact
                    with the black community. We really couldn't go into Soweto and we couldn't go
                    into the townships out of Pretoria, even just talk to people. Our consul general
                    had contacts with leaders, but as often these were with the white liberal class
                    as it was the African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems of with having Americanthe
                        professional Foreign Service peoplnot being seduced too much by the white
                        society or/and also not being appalled by apartheid. I would think this
                        would cause quite a morale problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had a lot of morale problems in Pretoria, but I think they had much to
                    do with having an absentee ambassador by virtue of the fact that he would have
                    to move to Cape Town for half a year. The political section of the embassy was
                    so focused on the politics of South Africa that there was not the same
                    camaraderie or the same leadership given to the embassy community as a whole.
                    The person who was left in charge of the embassy, while the ambassador was in
                    cape Town, was not a person who felt that taking care of the community was part
                    of his job requirements. Typically, it was the economic counselor who would be
                    forced into this job.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>There was always the question of “is South Africa a hardship post?” “should we
                    get differential?” “should we get this or that,” “should we get R&amp;R because,
                    after all, we are in this apartheid system, even though living is pretty good
                    down here.” There was always that dichotomy as well. Curiously, given the
                    relative living comforts, morale was not very good, but I don't think that it
                    had as much to do with living in the apartheid regime for most people as it did
                    just not having a real sense of strong community. We were spread out all over
                    Pretoria. A lot of the people who were assigned to the embassy were people who
                    had spent time in small African posts and were used to a closely knit embassy
                    community. Pretoria did not have a closely knit embassy community; we didn't
                    have the same social demands or social opportunities as you might find in other
                    African posts. I think, that said, when you left South Africa, either on R&amp;R
                    or just to get out of the country, people would come back and say, “I've got to
                    tell you, I had no idea of how oppressive this society was until I got out for a
                    couple days.” So to a certain extent people adapted to the circumstances. For
                    those of us who had spent a lot of time in black Africa, it was pretty appalling
                    when my neighbors would come up to me and tell mand this is a direct quotafter
                    knowing me for five minutes, “You need to understand our situation: our
                    “caffers”black workerare not like yours. You can't teach ours.”</p>
                <p>We had an African nanny working for us. Joyce was her name, and she was just
                    wonderful. She was big and strong. One time, a neighbor came by and complained
                    to us that she had pushed their kid off his bicycle. I asked Joyce about it. She
                    said, “Yes, he came up and started harassing me.” I told the neighbor to get her
                    child under control. We never saw those neighbors again. But it was that sort of
                    indignity that Africans would suffer almost routinelalthough I think the
                    situation in the early 1980s was better than it had been in the 1970s, but
                    obviously not as good as it needed to be. Johannesburg was a melting pot.
                    Tensions were higher in some instances. At the same time there was more
                    opportunity to mix. I played fast pitch softbalthey played softball and
                    basebaland I played on a team. South Africa has traditionally sent a softball
                    team to the world series of softball which is played in the United States every
                    couple of years.</p>
                <p>I played for the Northern District team champion, and we ended up playing in the
                    national championship. We were, I think, second or third in the national
                    championship. Softball was one of the few sports in South Africa that was fully
                    integrated, and even though it was fully integrated, the Northern District team
                    had nobody of color on it. The only teams that had people of color on it were
                    the Durban and the Cape Town teams.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I left there in 1982. Again, my tour was curtailed. Our ambassador to
                    Burundi had received a death threat, and she came to South Africa. A Libyan

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Frances Cook. She came to South Africa ostensibly to get medical
                    treatment but it was really to get out of Burundi while the police tracked down
                    this threat. She asked me if I wanted to come to be her deputy. That seemed like
                    an opportunity to break out of the administrative officer mold and go on and do
                    something else. So I said, “Yes.” It was a stretch assignment; it took awhile to
                    work through the system to make it happen. But Frances, for all her faults, was
                    a strong enough character to make it happen, and she brought me up to Burundi as
                    her DCM.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: By that point I was very comfortable in Africa. While in Washington, I
                    had made a couple trips out to a number of different posts looking at their
                    operations. I liked Africans, and I liked the challenges. It was apparent to me
                    from having talked to my colleagues who had worked in other parts of the world
                    that you got much more responsibility in Africa much earlier in your career. I
                    was able to put in a whole new information management system in South Africa
                    while I was there. I was able to spend a lot of money doing things. In
                    Brazzaville, when we reopened the post, I was master of my own destiny. Some of
                    my colleagues were still clipping newspapers in European capitals where nothing
                    much really happened. So I liked it, and so long as it kept offering me
                    challenging jobs, I went along for the ride.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: 1982 to 1985. As I said, Frances Cook was the ambassador. She had been
                    the office director for the Office of Public Affairs when I was in the Bureau of
                    African Affairs before going to Pretoria. Frances and I had known each since
                    1979 when I came back to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in 1982 in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WILSON: The political situation was okay. These were the good years. Tutsi
                    regimes in Burundi had historically come to power in a military coup, either
                    bloody or bloodless. The regimes have traditionally been nominated by the
                    southern Tutsis, who in their caste system are low on the ethnic hierarchy and,
                    as such, had been the recruitment source for the military historically. As they
                    got guns, they got power and became all powerful. When they come to power, they
                    did so on a platform of reconciliation, but because of the fact that 85 percent
                    of the population is Hutu and only 15 percent of the population is Tutsi,
                    eventually they become paranoid. As they become paranoid, they become more
                    authoritarian, and then the cycle of repression began again. When I got there,
                    we were on the good side of that cycle; there was still a lot of talk about
                    reconciliation. They were in the process of setting up a national assembly. They
                    had local and legislative elections which returned to the national assembly a
                    certain percentage of Hutu. Clearly it was not indicative of the 85 percent
                    strength they had in the population, the demographics, but it at least gave them
                    a voice in the national assembly. So things were fine. It was a good time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the composition of our embassy
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had an ambassador and DCM, a consular officer and a political economic
                    officer. We had a defense attach� that came from the CongZaire then. We had a
                    USIS operation, and we had a large AID mission with a number of projects that we
                    were on goinAnd then we had a couple of other agencies, including the Peace
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>Q: What was AID doing there?</p>
                <p>WILSON: AID was doing a health project; their big project was the peat project.
                    Burundi has peat bogs, and in the interest of forest conservation, AID was
                    working on a joint venture with the Irish peat bog to exploit the peat in
                    Burundi which could be used as an alternative fuel source to timber. They were
                    harvesting peat, converting it into fuel, developing ovens and pots and pans
                    that would work with peat, because peat gives off a higher heat than charcoal or
                    wood. Then they were subsidizing the sale of it in the open market. The project
                    was never economically viable, but it was interesting. The nature of the peat in
                    Burundi didn't lend itself to being used as a fuel, and the conversion of every
                    kitchen in Burundi from the one that they had been using to another one was just
                    simply out of the question. It never did work, but it was an interesting
                    project.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Frances Cook, but from your perspective
                        how did she run the embassy and how did she work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WILSON: Frances was a very dominant personality, very outgoing. She knew
                    everybody in the country. She defended and promoted U.S. interests and
                    activities with great enthusiasm, and she didn't mince words. Actually I thought
                    she was a lot of fun. She was everywhere. She cut a large swath through
                    Burundian society. She didn't hesitate to tell the Burundians of all stripes
                    what she thought. At that time, Burundi had one of the radical Marxist Leninist
                    socialist fascist military dictatorships that one saw during the Cold War in
                    Africa. Burundi had been the country that had introduced a resolution in the
                    United Nations equating Zionism with racism, I think is what it was, or Zionism
                    with colonialism or something like that; it had been that resolution that had
                    tied the UN General Assembly up in knots for a number of years and put Burundi
                    definitively on the list of countries we didn't value very highly. They were
                    still radicals within the OAU camp and were...</p>
                <p>Q: That's the Organization...</p>
                <p>WILSON: Organization of African Unity. They didn't like “constructive
                    engagement,” and they didn't think much of the United States. They were much
                    closer to the Soviet Union and becoming closer to France. The moderation during
                    this time of Burundi's foreign policy moved it from being a close confidante and
                    ally of the Soviet Union to being pretty close to the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Belgians by this time were pretty much out of it
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The relationship with Belgium was very similar to the relationship
                    between other African countries and their former colonial powersort of love/hate
                    relationship. The Belgians still maintained an interest, but they were only
                    peripherally involved. The Burundians liked Belgium as a country they could beat
                    up on, but they still felt comfortable sending their kids to Brussels or to
                    Louvain to go to university or other schools. I would say that the Belgians
                    exerted less influence on Burundi than, say, the French had exerted on their
                    former colonies historically. Remember that at the time of Burundian
                    independence, I think there was only one or maybe two university graduates; so
                    the Belgians hadn't done a whole lot. There was no real public school system in
                    Burundi worth mentioning.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I've always thoughand this was brought home to me when I was in
                    Burundthat Peace Corps is one of our best operations in Africa. It gets
                    Americans out to the village level. We learn a lot about Africa that way. We
                    should never underestimate the value to our own people of the Peace Corps
                    program and the value of getting our young people some knowledge about how life
                    is in the rest of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are a significant number who went into government,
                        either in Congress or in the Executive Branch, who brought that Peace Corps
                        experience with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes; more and more. I think Peace Corps volunteers are basically people
                    who are interested in public service generally and find the Peace Corps to their
                    liking, or if they go into Peace Corps, they then find public service to their
                    liking as a calling. We used to have a lot of ex Peace Corps volunteers in AID.
                    There were a number of former Peace Corps volunteers who were moving up in the
                    ranks of the Foreign Service at that time. They did a great job. We had about
                    110 Peace Corps volunteers throughout Burundi. They were involved in everything
                    from development of maternal/child health care programs to teaching to all sorts
                    of other activities. Raising fish was one that they did in the interior. To a
                    person, they were great; they were very active; it was a good group; they were
                    motivated. They found the people in the interior to be very welcoming once they
                    got over their sort of innate shyness.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: For me, it was my first tour as a DCM, and I learned an awful lot from
                    Frances. She was very good about introducing me, about encouraging me to take
                    initiative, about insuring that I was aware of everything that she was doing so
                    that I could fill in when she wasn't there. My range of contacts was pretty much
                    hers and then some. I ran a basketball team when I was there, for example; so I
                    had a somewhat different range of contacts that came through the basketball
                    league. Basketball was kind of the national pastime there, and we managed to get
                    some sponsorship for uniforms and balls and what not.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>WILSON: Interestingly, in the government of Burundi at the time, the tallest
                    minister was a Hutu and the shortest minister and the most Bantu looking
                    minister was a Tutsi; only they truly knew how the lineage passed. At the time I
                    was there, they estimated conservatively that the rate of intermarriage was
                    about 35 percent. They have clan distinctions and they have anthropological
                    distinctions that put people in one caste or the anther, but in fact there is an
                    awful lot of intermarriage there. It is even more pronounced in Burundi than it
                    is in Rwanda, for example, where when it became independent and had the
                    revolution or genocide that brought the Hutus to power, most of the Tutsis or a
                    good percentage of the Tutsis were driven out into refugee camps. Those who
                    remained in Rwanda afterwards had to carry ID cards. One's identification card
                    designated you as either Hutu or a Tutsi. That was the Rwandan practice. In
                    Burundi it was not like that. They were all Burundians, and you didn't have the
                    minority of the population driven into refugee camps. There were Hutu refugee
                    camps outside of Burundi, but the vast majority of the Burundi population was
                    Hutu. Our basketball team was young and fast. The Minister of Public Works had
                    his basketball team, and they used to beat us pretty regularly, but they were
                    older and savvier. They made up with the experience for what we had in
                    enthusiasm.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were concerned in those days about democratization; in other words the
                    political liberalization of the country. We were concerned that the country not
                    fall back into a genocidal type situation as had occurred in 1976; so we were
                    interested that there be put into place structures that would permit the
                    adjudication of conflicts in other than violent manners. We were concerned that
                    the Burundians be able to climb the ladder economically; so we were always
                    looking with them at ways of increasing their GDP.</p>
                <p>They produced a cash crop, which was coffee. They had their entire country
                    planted principally in beans. Legumes were the principal staple in their diet;
                    they had rice and they had some other things, and they harvested fish from Lake
                    Tanganyika and from some of the other interior waters and rivers. They were very
                    productive. For all intents and purposes, they were self sufficient in
                    agriculture. But they have a large population relative to the territory that
                    they live in. So they always had to make the land even more productive; they had
                    to come to grips with population growth; and they to come to grips with the
                    incipient, inherent ethnic conflict. Our AID and Peace Corps projects which were
                    designed to provide some humanitarian relief where necessary in the health
                    sector and/or some development type activities. We built a farm to market road
                    in southern Burundi, for example, to help open up some of the farmers to get
                    their coffee crops down to the markets. So those were the sorts of things we
                    were concerned about.</p>

                <p>WILSON: In those days, we were doing a human rights report every year which meant
                    that to the extent to which there were human rights violations in Burundi, we
                    were reporting on them. For my first two years there anyway, the situation was
                    pretty good and improving, I suppose. 'Improving' is probably a better way of
                    describing it rather than 'pretty good.' There were still arbitrary arrests; the
                    justice system was not very good, and you didn't have a free press, but for the
                    first couple years I was there, things were getting better. The National
                    Assembly permitted additional voices from the Burundian society to be heard.
                    There was a sense of liberalization. Now, from the second to the third year,
                    that changed, and the Bagaza regimJean Batiste Bagaza was the presidenbecame
                    increasingly paranoid and as a consequence became increasingly authoritarian. It
                    began to see enemies among the missionaries, in the churches, and then by
                    extension in the larger Hutu population. We started to see arbitrary arrests,
                    priests being thrown in jail, missionaries being thrown out of the country or
                    being thrown in jail.</p>

                <p>WILSON: There were not very many American missionaries. There must have been one
                    or two. There were some Seventh Day Adventist missionaries there. There were
                    some Catholic, French and Italian Catholic, missionaries and priests there. We

                    were putting health centers up in the interior, and they were doing it on a sort
                    of a pay as you go; they were trying to develop some sense of shared
                    responsibility for health care between the patients and the providers of medical
                    services.</p>

                    very much your activist ambassador, and she was of that generation which
                    approached the job of being ambassador with great zeal and enthusiasm. We had no
                    Washington guidance whatsoever. If there was a hiccup that we took umbrage at,
                    we were all over them like a dirty shirt.</p>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WILSON: They loved her. As she pointed out, for the first couple years she was
                    there, she would bang on doors and nobody would answer. Then they got used to
                    her, and they basically began to accept her because she brought things with her.
                    She was good natured; she truly wanted a better future for Burundi, and so she
                    worked very hard to get AID programs in place and to enhance the presence of
                    Peace Corps. Peace Corps got started in Burundi when I got there. I actually
                    brought the document with me which brought the first Peace Corps volunteers
                    there. She had done all the spade work, she had done all the negotiating and she
                    had worked the arrangements to bring this program to Burundi. She did all the
                    negotiating for an IMET prograa military training prograthe authorization for
                    which I also brought with me when I came to the country. So these were all
                    things that she had done. The Burundians saw that she was prepared to work for a
                    better U.S. Burundi relationship. They understood that the cost of bringing
                    these programs was that they would have to listen to her expressing the views of
                    the United States when they did things that didn't match up with our interests
                    or our concerns.</p>

                        the Soviet Union and sort of the extreme socialist world pretty heavy
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I first got there in 1982, it was about the time that the IMF and
                    the World Bank were starting to talk about privatization and the need to develop
                    private sectors as part of a country's economic management strategy. So there
                    was already a lot of interest in seeing how things could be privatized,
                    including the coffee cooperativthe buying system that they had in place. Now,
                    the Burundians, like a lot of other African governments, were always willing to
                    sell off assets that didn't make any money or didn't employ anybodventures that
                    lost money and didn't employ anybody's cousins, but there weren't many of those
                    in Burundi. So the pace of privatization moved very, very slowly.</p>
                <p>Politically they were interested in our Constitution. Even if they weren't
                    interested in our Constitution, we made sure that they got copies of it,
                    translated it into French so that they would all read and understand it. I'm
                    sure that Frances must have highlighted a few copies to insure that they would
                    focus on the important parts. They were interested in that. I think that they
                    were looking for a way to practice a more modern system of governance, which
                    would allow them to manage the affairs of state more effectively than they had
                    done in the past. The issue, of course, was how much power were they prepared to
                    give up in doing so. The great fear, which remains to this day in these
                    countries, is who's going to be massacred if they give up that one centimeter or
                    one pound too much of power.</p>

                        massacres occur, particularly since independence apparently; it's more a
                        modern phenomenon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I think any family with some substance does exactly that. They try to
                    have a way out and a place to go. In Burundi there was still this nightmare of
                    the 1976 massacres. At the time that I was there, everybody was very sensitive
                    to that; people sort of tiptoed around all the core issues. There was no such
                    thing as a “Truth and Reconciliation” Commission. There was no such thing as
                    facing up to the events of 1976. You would come at event somewhat obliquely;
                    people would in confidence tell you the stories of their experiences during
                    1976, whether Hutu or Tutsi, because the massacres took place both ways. There
                    were 60,000 Tutsis who were murdered during the first couple nights, and then
                    maybe 600,000 Hutu that were killed in the aftermath in a systematic fashion by
                    the Micombero government and by the military.</p>
                <p>There was still some sense of reconciliation after the 1976 massacres; people
                    seemed to be focused on that. Towards the end of my tenure in Burundi, the Tutsi
                    regime was getting paranoid again, which is a common thread through the politics
                    of the region. When the Tutsis are in power, after a while, they get paranoid
                    and then they get oppressive, and then you have essentially a return to some war
                    as they force people into guerilla activities..</p>

                    The North Koreans built a building. They built what I guess was going to be the
                    new National Assembly. It was completed the year that I left. I actually went to
                    an event there where President Bagaza spoke for about three and a half hours in
                    Kirundi, which I certainly didn't understand and nobody else in the diplomatic
                    corps understood. But I remember distinctly sitting on these uncomfortable seats
                    that had been put in by the North Koreans to fit people of North Korean stature.
                    They were very tight for somebody over 5'6.” Your knees literally were up
                    against the seat in front of you. The Burundians were pretty big people, and the
                    seats were obviously too small. For three and a half hours in this seat
                    listening to the speech in Kirundi was not the most pleasant of my
                    experiences.</p>

                <p>WILSON: A couple of things were happening when I was there. One of our policy
                    requirements was to defend and support “constructive engagement.” Burundi was
                    one of the most skeptical countries about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain was constructive...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: “Constructive engagement” was a U.S. effort predicated on the notion that
                    if you were going to solve the southern African racial conundrum, you had to do
                    it by persuasion and by evolution and not by fomenting revolution in South
                    Africa. You had to try and maintain some infrastructure in place so that it all
                    wouldn't be destroyed in the process. “Constructive engagement,” as it was
                    practiced, solved the southern African problems one by one, beginning with the
                    resolution of the Angolan civil war and then moved on to the independence of
                    Namibia and ultimately to the change of regime in South Africa. It was a concept
                    that was articulated by Chet Crocker in a Foreign Affairs article before the
                    election of Reagan in 1980. It was despised by Africans because they saw it as
                    racist, and even if it wasn't racist, they thought that it was way too soft on
                    the apartheid regime of South Africa. You can make a lot of sort of rhetorical
                    money by denouncing “constructive engagement,” which the Burundians did.</p>
                <p>I remember that the first part of our strategy was to deal with the international
                    implications of the Angolan civil war, i.e., first the Cuban troops in Angola
                    and then the South African troops in Angola. I remember about three weeks after
                    I got therI was Charg� then because Frances had left the countrI was summoned to
                    the foreign ministry by the then foreign minister, a guy by the name of Edward
                    Nzambimana. He was a colonel who had participated in the coup that brought
                    Bagaza to power. He had been a prime minister and he had been the foreign
                    minister. He was a savvy guy and a real radical. He summoned me to discuss an
                    arcane element of our approach towards Angola. We were negotiating with both
                    sides, or all sides, in the Angolan civil war the withdrawal of Cuban and South
                    African troops from Angola. The question was would the withdrawals be linked, or
                    would there be parallel movement, which would have come down to having one South
                    African leave for every Cuban. I spent 45 minutes explaining to the foreign
                    minister what the subtle distinction and differences were between these two
                    approaches and what was on the table. After I left, I went home thinking that I
                    had done a great job in my first meeting as charge' with the foreign minister. I
                    got home and turned on Voice of America. George Bush, who was then Vice
                    President, had just landed in Nairobi, Kenya, and at his airport press
                    conference somebody asked him, “Is there any difference between linkage and
                    parallel movement?” to which he answered” no.” So I figured my credibility with
                    this foreign minister was shot after having wasted 45 minutes of his time
                    telling him there was a difference. Fortunately for me, he got fired about three
                    weeks later, and he neglected to tell his successor what a bad diplomat I
                    was.</p>

                <p>The Libyans were involved. The Libyans had always had designs on that part of
                    central Africa, and the Libyans had money that they were prepared to spend
                    there. They did things like putting up a library. When I was there, Qadhafi came
                    to visit one time. During the course of his speech he got so vehemently anti
                    American, virulently anti American, that somebody pulled the plug on his
                    microphone, which was gratifying to us. The fellow who did it later came to see
                    me to explain to me what he had done and to tell me why he had done it. We were
                    concerned because the Libyans were making menacing noises at that time. In fact,
                    we had some information that they were supporting terrorist activities in the
                    region, supporting activities against American and, in fact, French interests,
                    and some of the stuff that we were seeing then later got played out in west and
                    central Africa a few years later. So, yes, we were concerned about them, and one
                    of our objectives was to make sure that the Burundians understood our concerns
                    about the Libyans. At that time they were fighting a war in Chad with the French
                    along the Aouzi strip. The French and the Chadians were basically fighting the
                    war; we were supporting it. So that was one of our...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The Burundian position was always 'We understand your concerns. We want
                    to be friends with the United States, even as we're attacking you on
                    “constructive engagement.” We want to assure you that we're watching the Libyans
                    closely and we're not going to let them do anything that is untoward or out of
                    hand or that undermines our regime.' That region had had some experience with
                    Libyan involvement. The Libyans had invaded Uganda to defend Idi Amin and the
                    Tanzanians had deployed and defeated Libyan troops and had gotten Amin out of
                    there. So there was some history in the region of Libyan troops actually
                    deploying. Burundi is not a Muslim country. I think maybe less than one percent
                    of the country was Muslim, so they didn't see a Qadhafi library as being
                    terribly threatening to them, or that the Libyans were actually going to be able
                    to convert a bunch of Burundian Catholics to Islam.</p>

                        was, essentially destroying the Tanzanian relatively rich economy. Were the

                <p>WILSON: The relationship between Tanzania and Burundi has always been tense,
                    principally because Tanzania was the port through which a lot of Burundian goods
                    went as well as imports into Burundi. The Tanzanians, by controlling access,
                    were able to exact their pound of flesh from the Burundians. There was also a
                    certain arrogance in the way the Tanzanians approached the landlocked countries.
                    There were also some Hutu refugee camps on Tanzanian territory, and the
                    Burundians were concerned that there would be destabilization efforts being
                    launched from Tanzania anytime that Nyerere decided he wanted to do something.
                    The people in the Tanzanian government were principally from Brururi, which was
                    the southernmost province, bordering on Tanzania; that generated a sort of cross
                    border understanding and tension. Nyerere was not universally admired in
                    Burundi, to say the least.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I think that's right. It'll be interesting to see what the revisionist
                    history of the Nyerere era will say about him. There were some things that he
                    did which were pretty successful. For example, I think he actually was pretty
                    successful, at least on the mainland, of forging a Tanzanian identity, but at
                    great cost. Whether or not the cost through the years of bad economic policies
                    were worth the forging of a national identity, I think, is anybody's guess, but
                    I suspect it will be several hundred years, or at least 100 years, before
                    anybody definitively makes a case one way or the other. From my perspective, it
                    was unfortunate that Nyerere became the mediator of the Burundian dispute,
                    because I think there is merit in having somebody who is truly a disinterested
                    party to be the mediator in these things. Nyerere was never disinterested, and
                    Tanzanian Burundian relations are replete with examples of Tanzanian
                    destabilization efforts of Burundi or at least harassing Burundi over the years.
                    That doesn't make for a good mediator.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Rwanda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Relations with Rwanda were always tense because you had a Hutu government
                    in power in Kigali and a Tutsi government in power in Burundi; that made for a
                    little bit of concern. After I left, there were massacres in the north in the
                    late 1980s; even during the time that I was in Burundi, there was always concern
                    that the Rwandans were working with Burundian Hutus. The Hutu population was
                    even larger in the north than it was in the south; so along the Rwandan border,
                    there was always concern about that. The relations were strained. The two
                    countries talked to each other. They were part of the Great Lakes Organization,
                    so they all talked to each other. Every now and again Mobutu would mediate some
                    issue between them. But relations were not real cordial.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Relations with the Congo were interesting because Mobutu played the
                    regional relationship very much as he played his own domestic politics. He would
                    not hesitate to use the carrot if he felt it necessary or to use the stick. At
                    one time, Mobutu decided that he wanted to double his defense budget. He took
                    advantage of a Qadhafi visit to Burundi to visit the United States and say that
                    Qadhafi was planning to invade the Congo from Burundi using Burundian troops. He
                    said that Qadhafi had delivered a bunch of Zodiac boats to southern Burundi to
                    effect an invasion across Lake Tanganyika. Therefore, he, Mobutu, was going to
                    have to double the defense budget, and the United States was going to have to
                    come up with some more money. We went and looked for these Zodiac boats
                    everywhere and looked for any evidence of Libyan training and obviously couldn't
                    find any because there was none to be found. So Mobutu would not hesitate to use
                    such excuses. Mobutu occupied a heavy position in the region. He was “the man.”
                    The Congo was and is a huge countrpotentially very wealth47 million people
                    compared to 4 or 5 million in Burundi and 4 or 5 million in Rwanda. They were
                    all Francophones and they could all deal with Belgium. So he was the predominant
                    power obviously.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I don't think we did because I don't recall any. We might have gone and
                    spoken on behalf of a political prisoner, but I don't recall. I just don't think
                    there were that many political prisoners while we were there. My second
                    ambassador, Jim Bullington, had a cook who was a Seventh Day Adventist; he was
                    arrested in late 1984 or early 1985 as part of a round up of the cultisti.e.
                    other religions that were deemed by the government to be subverting its
                    authority. Bullington took this as a personal affront, and it became sort of a
                    cause celebre for our relationship. The Burundians wouldn't release the
                    ambassador's cook. I know that we must have made some demarches as people were
                    being rounded up, buI just don't recall anymore.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there during the Reagan Administration, and you were mentioning that
                    population was a real problem. Of course, we had our problems, domestic
                    problems, about various forms of birth control, particularly abortion. Did that
                    mean we weren't a player in the population side?</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WILSON: It meant that we didn't run any population control programs and we didn't
                    participate in any programs of the planned parenthood variety that might have
                    either an abortion information component or an abortion component. We did do
                    some maternal child health care type activities which were designed to enhance
                    the health of both the mother and the unborn child and then subsequently the
                    child. As part of that, we would talk about child spacing. This was principally
                    done by Peace Corps. They would be out in the villages talking to the mothers
                    about the utility of maybe waiting two or three years before you have a second
                    or third or fourth child.</p>

                <p>WILSON: AIDS was becoming an issue towards the end of my tour there. We were just
                    beginning to hear stories about this. In fact, I watched a number of friends in
                    Burundtwo aidepass on in subsequent years. We were already hearing about the
                    route from Mombasa for trucking goods through Uganda, Rwanda and to Burundi. All
                    along that route there were stories about AIDS beginning to affect
                    populationtrucker populations and the prostitute population. Jonathan Mann was
                    in the Congo; he was an American doing research on the AIDS phenomenon and was
                    beginning to write cables about the pandemic that AIDS was going to become.</p>

                <p>WILSON: We had a drought during one of the years that I was in Burundi. It would
                    have been 1983 84, or 1984 85. There was a lot of concern that the harvest would
                    come up short and that they would need some additional food products. We
                    actually got ahead of that. It was at a time when we were doing this air relief
                    into Ethiopia because nobody had seen the consequences of the drought there.
                    We'd seen it a year ahead of time and we'd managed to organize Catholic relief
                    services and some of these groups as well as USAID began to report on this. We
                    were submitting of reports on the weather throughout the country and trying to
                    plot whether or not the harvest was going to come up short. As a consequence we
                    were actually able to stockpile several thousand tons of food products on the
                    east coast ready if needed to be shipped to Burundi and we did. We had enough
                    stockpiled so that we were able to use some of these stocks that we planned for
                    Burundi for other relief requirements. We were pretty pleased with thathat we
                    had actually put into place an early warning system. We were pretty gratified
                    about that. Other than that, we went through the good periods and then we
                    started going through the bad periods. Then my three years were up and I moved
                    on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking for a political cycle or was there one
                        almost well established that could be predictable enough for paranoia to set
                        in or was this something that you more or less realized in hindsight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We could see it coming. It was curious. The cycle sort of changed about
                    the time that France gave up sovereignly. Just before she withdrew, we started
                    seeing a reaction to missionary activities and religious activities. If
                    anything, Washington was reading our reporting and was saying, “Gee, Frances,
                    maybe you've got “clientitis,” because she was pretty enthusiastic about the
                    changes that were being made. When Jim Bullington came out, he took a cold,
                    steely eyed look at the situation, and he started reporting from his
                    perspective. In fact, the situation was changing. We had gone from a pretense of
                    democratization to authoritarianism, which culminated in the arrest of his cook,
                    as I mentioned. We began to use a different slant on our report, but it was
                    pretty clear that this was a cycle that Burundian regimes went through. In fact,
                    you needed to put in place, I think, as many safeguards as one possibly could as
                    early as possible in the hopes that they would not all be destroyed when the
                    subsequent paranoia set in these regimes. Curiously, after we sort of identified
                    the new trends, we were criticized for being too critical. Go figure.</p>

                        sort of outsiders mucking around with government controls. I'm talking about
                        the NGOs. Did you see this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes; we saw it principally when we looked at humanitarian relief.
                    Catholic World Relief Services, Catholic Relief Services, had been a partner
                    with USAID on some of our “Food For Work” and “Food For Peace” programs. Our
                    farm to market road had been financed through “Food For Peace;” it was managed
                    by Catholic Relief Services. They would bring in all the food and distribute it.
                    When we geared up for the potential drought, we used them exclusively. We were
                    still early in Burundi's development so that only the traditional NGOs were
                    there. Catholic Relief Services, Lutheran World Relief, and the Seventh Day
                    Adventist groups were the ones that were most active. There was not yet the
                    explosion of other NGOs. They were viewed with a mixture of appreciation and
                    suspicion by the host governments. What were all these guys doing there? There
                    was also the growth of some of advocacy groups at that time as well. That meant
                    that in addition to our human rights reporting, interested parties were starting
                    to get reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, some of which
                    were consistent with what we were reporting and some of which went further than
                    what we were reporting. They had some different information on some subjects
                    than we had. They had different takes on the threats to organized religion by
                    the government. So we had these two groups, which confused the NGO picture
                    somewhat because in some people's minds it was not clear whether they were an
                    NGO development group or an NGO advocacy group.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You can't generalize. The traditional ones worked very well together. The
                    Seventh Day Adventist project was a great project, and they worked very well
                    with the Ministry of Health. They worked best with those ministries that were
                    underfunded and overburdened. Catholic Relief Services was good in the
                    distribution of food to those who needed it. The Adventists were good in
                    developing the health centers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about that there were no college graduates
                        in Burundi. Did you find that there was a pretty sophisticated government
                        structure by this time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>WILSON: The government structure was principally a military government, so all
                    the key players were military officers. The military, as is true in so many of
                    these little African countries, was the only organization worthy of the term
                    'organization.' Burundi had people who had been educated, but not in a liberal
                    arts education; it was a military education. By the time I got there in the
                    198020 years after independencthere was a generation of educated Burundians,
                    mostly Tutsi, but they were all pretty young. The ministers were in their early
                    30s, for example. Bagaza himself was only 36 at the time. So it was a pretty
                    young regime. They focused on educatiotrying to get people educatebut they had a
                    long way to go because during the 1976 massacres, one of the principal targets
                    for execution were every educated Hutu. They assumed that a Hutu with glasses
                    was an educated Hutu. Therefore, wearing glasses was a death sentence. After
                    that, you can imagine that in Burundi society the desire for education was not
                    universal, to say the least. There was a sort of paradox. The people that we
                    dealt with mostly were educated. A lot of them had been educated in the East
                    because the Soviets and the East Germans had put a lot of money into bringing
                    these people into their systems. One of my principal interlocutors had been
                    educated in Bulgaria, of all places. That background gave some Burundians an
                    ideological baggage which gave them a Marxist understanding of how economies
                    ought to be structured and managed. They did not always a great education.
                    Increasingly there are people who were going off to Belgium and some that are
                    going off to France, because France was offering some education. There were some
                    that had gone off to the States either on Fulbright scholarships or some AID
                    program that provided them some education. I had always thought that the fall of
                    Berlin Wall presaged basically the cutback in scholarships from Eastern Europe.
                    If there was ever a void to be filled, that was it; we could have filled
                    relatively inexpensively and we would have been able to train literally an
                    entire generation of African elite along Westermore politically and economically

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Yugoslavia in the 1960s when almost an entire
                        African student group said, “The hell with this.” They arrived in Belgrade
                        and said, “Get us out of here. We're being called black monkeys and all
                        this.” They weren't getting any real education in the East. We took a lot of
                        them and sent them off to pretty good places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We should have continued to do that. We never should have let that
                    opportunity pass. There were a lot of them going off to China, a lot going off
                    to the Soviet Union. Actually it worked in our favor because many would come
                    back with real ambivalence if not outright hatred of their experience.</p>

                        muttered in front of them, and the Africans knew enough Bulgarian to
                        understand. It was not a pleasant experience.</hi>

                        gorillas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: G O R I L L A S as opposed to G U E R I L LAS. There were some mountain
                    gorillas in eastern Congthen Zairin the Keva region. There were also gorillas in
                    Diane Fossi's area in Rwanda. There were no gorillas in Burundi, but we used to
                    go over to Bukavu fairly frequently to see the gorillas. A friend of mine was
                    the head of the Peace Corps training program there. All the new Peace Corps
                    volunteers were trained in Bukavu before the Congolese wars; so we used to go
                    over there and talk to the new Peace Corps volunteers and take advantage of such
                    occasions to go see the gorillas, which was a lot of fun. It was one of the more
                    interesting things you could dtrek through the forests and run across a family
                    of gorillas complete with silver backs and the little ones, and learn the
                    etiquette and protocol of approaching a group of gorillas in the forest.</p>
                <p>I was in Burundi obviously, as I mentioned earlier, from '82 to '85, which was a

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I left Burundi in August of 1985 and came back to the States. I had been
                    accepted in the American Political Science Association Congressional Fellowship
                    Program.</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this program consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WILSON: It consisted of one quarter at Johns Hopkins University taking one class
                    in American foreign policy and the politics of foreign policy, which also gave
                    us the time to visit and observe Congress and then begin to interview for a
                    Congressional staff position. There were at that time, I think, four State
                    Department officers who were participants in this program our of about 60
                    students every year. An old friend of mine, Jeff Davidow, had been in a similar
                    program, if not that program, knew that our time would not be fully occupied.
                    Rather than let me spend my days hanging around congressional galleries talking
                    to staffers and interviewing with congressmen, he brought me back into the
                    Department to work on a special project which was block the proposed sanctions
                    against South African congressional attempt to impose economic sanctions on
                    South Africa, which ultimately succeeded. There was a large operation in the
                    State Department trying to thwart the will of Congress on this. It was a
                    fascinating experience. I wasn't sure it was exactly what the State Department
                    should be doing, but like a good soldier, I saluted and did it. I ended up going
                    to work as a Congressional Fellow for the first half of my fellowship. The
                    fellowship was constructed in such a way that we did some class work, including
                    writing a paper. I wrote a paper on our Angolan policy focusing on the
                    congressional activities of the 1970s which curtailed our involvement in Angola.
                    I covered the congressional hearinthe Church Committee hearings and others.</p>
                <p>I worked on the Hill for the then junior Senator from Tennessee, Al Gore; I
                    worked for him for half of my term, until about April, as, of all things, his
                    agricultural legislative aide. That was the year of the passage of the Farm Bill
                    and the implementation of one aspect which affected him considerably and that
                    was the dairy buy out provision. The Congress in its wisdom decided that our
                    dairy herds were too large and, therefore, they provided some incentives to
                    farmers to reduce the size of their dairy herds by giving them money to
                    slaughter their herds. A number of dairy farmers wanted to do this because they
                    weren't making any money on milk and cheese, so they went ahead and slaughtered
                    their herds. They got paid by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and they
                    dumped all their meat on the open meat market. The center of independent beef
                    futures commodity traders is in Memphis, Tennessee. When the dumping took place,
                    I got a call from Senator Gore saying, “I'm down here in Memphis, Tennessee, and
                    my constituents are going bananas. The bottom has dropped out of the beef
                    futures commodity markets. You've got to prepare something for me. We got to
                    stop this.” So we did. We got hold of the Department of Agriculture and said,
                    “You really need to phase this program in so that you don't disrupt the
                    markets.” We gave Al a statement when he got back at noon from Memphis,
                    Tennessee; he went to the floor of the Senate and read his statement decrying
                    the attempt to put commodity futures traders into the tank through the ill
                    advised dumping of beef onto the market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you getting your information about agriculture?
                        Knowing you background, I can't see how you did it. Were you a quick study
                        or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WILSON: I wouldn't say I was a quick study, but when you're working in Congress
                    on legislation, you get the input from the constituents and from all the various
                    staffers and everybody's who is working on the legislation. You look through all
                    of this input and try to figure out what makes sense and what doesn't make
                    sense. Eventually you get everybody actually calling you. Going out and getting
                    the information isn't hard. Sifting fact from fiction from the various people
                    who have a view on the bill is probably more difficult. In the end the drafting
                    is done in committee. Our particular concern was the legislation address the
                    dairy buyout provision; after that, you know, life went on. But I would not say
                    that I was an architect of this particular piece of legislation at all. We were
                    just trying to defend the interests of our constituents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Al Gore?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think Al Gore is a very fine public servant. I thought he was terrific.
                    I traveled with him to Tennessee. In his town meetings in Tennessee, he was
                    great. I remember going to my first town meeting with him. We flew to Memphis
                    and stayed with his uncle in Jackson, Tennessee. When I got up the next morning,
                    I figured that since I was going to a town meeting with the U.S. Senator, I'd
                    better look good. So I brought out my very best double breasted suit and my best
                    tie and nice white shirt perfectly pressed and shined my shoes up real good and
                    I went to breakfast. Al comes in and he's in this blue suit that's kind of
                    threadbare and he's got kind of a frayed collar on his Arrow button down blue
                    shirt and a burgundy tie with sort of a stain on it. I looked at his shoes and
                    they were whatever Rockports of those ages wersort of scruffy and what not. I
                    thought, “Gee, this is a U.S. Senator. Shouldn't he be looking a little bit
                    better for this appearance?” We got to the first town meetinthis was about 6:30
                    or seven o'clock in the morninand the guys who were there were the people who
                    had grievances. The people who have grievances that they want to talk to their
                    Senator about are not typically the people who are going to dress up at seven
                    o'clock in the morning in their finest suit, even if they owned a suit. They
                    were basically in coveralls with either John Deere or Jack Daniels ballcaps and
                    sort of lace up hiking boots or tennis shoes or something, and their checked
                    plaid shirts basically, your farmer type thingsort of downtrodden farmers of
                    rural Tennessee. As I got out of the car and looked at Al and looked at these
                    guys, I realized who the odd man out was; it wasn't Al. So I went around to the
                    back of the car, popped the trunk, took off my coat and loosened my tie, and
                    kind of took my collar and bent it up a little bit. Then I found a bit of mud
                    and rubbed it across my shoetops so I looked a little bit more like the
                    constituents. Then we had a good time. We traveled through Tennessee. Gore was
                    very animated with his constituents. He would return to Tennessee three weekends
                    out of four. He would fly down on Friday night after the Senate session ended,
                    spend all day traveling crisscrossing the state and then fly back Sunday morning
                    in time to take his wife and kids to church. I found him very serious on the
                    subjects that he cared about, which happened to be subjects that mattered even
                    if they're not politically sexy. Arms control is not a politically sexy topic,
                    but he was a master of it. He was an absolute master of the science and
                    technology of peace, well before anybody else was ever thinking about it. When
                    he said he invented the Internet, to a large extent it was his support that
                    allowed the development of it to go forward. Even Newt Gingrich has given him
                    credit for that. Al's problem has always been that he doesn't appear very
                    comfortable in front of a camera, and because of that, he lost the election.
                    Everybody talks about Florida, but it wasn't Florida that cost him the election;
                    it was Tennessee.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The election of 2000. If he had spent a little more time a s Vice
                    President worrying about Tennessee, the election might have come out
                    differently. But Gore is not a natural politician. He's a natural policy guy; he
                    is a natural mover of issues governmental; he is a public administrator, but he
                    is not a natural politician. If he had spent a little bit more time in
                    Tennessee, if he had gotten another road built or if he had gotten a bridge
                    built or something like that, then the course of history might have been
                    changed; but it just wasn't in his character to do that. He was Vice President
                    of the United States; he had a larger set of issues to deal with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you stint in Gore's office, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I went over to the House side to work for the then majority whip as his
                    whip assistant; that was Tom Foley of Spokane, Washington. What I did for him
                    was to be basically his staff guy on those issues that he addressed in his
                    capacity as a leader of the Democratic Partthe majority Whip. If he was called
                    upon to meet the National Organization of Nuclear Power Plant Operators, which
                    he did, to speak to them at a luncheon, then I would prepare his talking points
                    and I would do the potential Q's and A's, and then I would travel with him. He
                    was wonderful. He would take me everywhere. He didn't have a desk in his office.
                    He had a sort of a living room type arrangement in the whip's office. Whenever
                    he was in there, I was welcomed. From a Congressional Fellowship perspective it
                    was great because I got a lot of one on one time with him. He would basically
                    spend all his days telling people stories of what it was like in the House of
                    Representatives from 1964 on; I learned a wonderful history of the House from
                    the time of Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>At that time Congressmen were constantly running for their leadership positions
                    in the House. Foley went on to be Speaker. He would spend a lot of time with his
                    colleagues; he would be over in their offices a lot talking to them. We would
                    have whip meetings every Tuesday attended by all the assistant whips. Tip
                    O'Neill was the Speaker then. Tip and Wright and Tom Foley would chair these
                    meetings and all the assistant whips would be there. Our offices were right in
                    the Capitol building, putting us right in the Rotunda. It was a great
                    experience, a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>Tom and Heather Foley are just about as nice people as one could hope for. From
                    that whole experience, I learned to have tremendous respect for how hard these
                    people work. You can disagree with them philosophically, you can disagree with
                    the interests that they represenand a with a lot of them I disagree passionately
                    about the interest that they represenbut you can't deny that they work really
                    hard for their constituents and for their interests. They're back in their
                    constituencies almost every weekend. For somebody like Tom, that meant flying
                    across country on Friday and flying back on Sunday night on the red eye from
                    Spokane. But those were the things that had to be done. There were always things
                    that you had to do back in the district and there was a lot of legislation that
                    had to be worked on in Congress.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Every time a Gore constituent had a probleand most of the time they
                    werLatin America type problemcouldn't get a visa or people were arrested therhe
                    or she would call their senator, who call me and I would then call the State
                    Department to try to get the problem resolved. That was most of our interface
                    with the Department. When I was working for the Tom Foley, the House passed a
                    bill that beefed up in a major waaround a billion dollarthe security funding for
                    the State Department, the first time that had happened. The rationale had been
                    provided by a commission that had studied the problem. Our then Assistant
                    Secretary for DiplomatiSecuritI think it was Bob Lamwas quoted afterwards in the
                    Washington Post as saying, “Well, this money is great and good, but at the end
                    of the day it is people who make the difference on security.” Foley had been a
                    big supporter of this bill; he was not real happy about that comment. He thought
                    that the State Department ought to be a little bit more grateful for this
                    billion dollar windfall. We called Bob to invite him to the whip's office to
                    have a little chat with him about his views on why this billion dollars wouldn't
                    enhance the security of our diplomatic missions overseas and whether we should
                    really be spending that money. He was appropriately chastened. It was kind of
                    fun to watch. He was an old time administrative officer. He'd been the
                    administrative counselor in Bonn. He was of one of the best of his generation.
                    He was well known. He'd come back from Bonn and had been appointed to be the
                    assistant secretary for administration; he later went on to be assistant
                    secretary for security, and then went to Cyprus as our ambassador. When he came
                    in to Foley's office, he was meek and mild mannered. Tom had a little chat with
                    him about his being “misquoted” in the Washington Post about the importance of
                    the billion dollar security program. That was kind of fun.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to return to one thing. You were saying that you
                        were part time trying to block efforts of Congress to get nasty with South
                        Africa.</hi>

                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WILSON: If I were to really think through what our mission was, it was to insure
                    that there would no mandate on the executive branch with respect to imposing
                    sanctions on South Africa. It was inimical to what Chet Crocker was trying to
                    accomplish through “constructive engagement.” He thought that it would tie his
                    hands and restrict his maneuverability, which was absolutely true. So the
                    administration wanted no part of that; just as a matter of policy it didn't want
                    it. If you recall, before Reagan came into office, he gave a press conference
                    and somebody asked him a question on South Africa, “What do you think about the
                    apartheid regime of South Africa,” or something to that effect. He said, “Well,
                    you know, South Africa has been an ally of ours in every war we've been in and
                    it's a country with enormous mineral resources, etc...” The South Africans took
                    that to mean that they would get a free pass on the issue of apartheid, which
                    wasn't in fact the case. In fact the administration, and Crocker in particular,
                    was going to work with the South Africans, encouraging them and pressuring
                    thefirst gentlto come to grips with issue of majority rule within their own
                    country as well as the issue of independence of Namibia and how we and they were
                    going to deal with the Angolan civil war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We put together talking points as to why the sanctions regime wouldn't
                    work. We devised together approaches to state and local government on why they
                    should not be meddling in foreign affairs by imposing restrictions on their own
                    pension funds and things like that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Massachusetts was one. Berkeley was another. We had set up a state and
                    local government office so that we communicate with them about sanctions. We
                    offered to send people out to speak publicly on these subjects. We were trying
                    to come up with ways to explain to Congress why this wasn't a good idea and to
                    take on those who thought it was a good idea.</p>

                        this was the right course, one that would maybe reach a proper outcome, or
                        was it sort of a compromising with the devil?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WILSON: I had just come from South Africa; I had seen apartheid in operation and
                    had on my staff a number of South Africans. I was not at the timand I say this
                    openlI was not a big supporter of “constructive engagement.” I thought we ought
                    to be taking a much harder line. I always thought that backing Jonas Savimbi in
                    Angola was a mistake. I sort of held your nose and defended the policy, but of
                    course that's what you're paid to do. It's like being a lawyer. You defend
                    unpopular cases. Having said that, I have to say that in retrospect you have to
                    give Crocker some credit, because at the end of the day, southern Africa evolved
                    without major civil wars.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in INR working on Africa much earlier. Then it was
                        accepted that there was going to be a night of long knivethe black South
                        Africans going after the white South Africans, and it was going to be
                        nasty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. The consensus in the early 1980s, when I was at a Security
                    Assistance conference in Germany, was that by the year 2000/2003, South Africa
                    would look a lot like Lebanoa lot of different ethnic groups and factions
                    fighting each other. There is a lesson in that for me: even if a policy is
                    unpopular, you have to take a look at the strategy and you have to take a look
                    at what your objectives are and then you have to figure out how best to get
                    there. At the time, the policy was clearly intellectual. It was not difficult to
                    defend, because the idea of evolution versus revolution is a pretty easy idea to
                    defend, but in retrospect I give Chet an awful lot of credit for his
                    steadfastness and for his ability, in the face of irrational opposition, to stay
                    the course and move the process forward.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were off in 1986 to the Congo, Brazzaville. Could you
                        describe the type of government. What was the political and economic
                        situation in Brazzaville, and how did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WILSON: I got the job because I had already been DCM in Burundi, so I had a track
                    record as DCM. A fellow that I had worked with in South Africa by the name of
                    Alan Lukenhe had been consul general in Cape Town and had been named ambassador
                    to Brazzavillasked me if I'd like to go and be his DCM. I said “Sure;” it
                    sounded like a lot of fun. The Congo, Brazzaville, is a former French colony as
                    opposed to the Congo, Kinshasa, which was a former Belgian colony. The Congo has
                    traditionally been one of the most politicized of all African countries. They
                    have had political movements and violent demonstrations in the streets for
                    virtually their entire modern history. When I was there, there were in the
                    throes of, I guess, the second or third Marxist Leninist socialist fascist
                    military dictatorship, which basically meant that the military was in control.
                    There was a military colonel, Denis Sassou Nguesso, who was in charge of the
                    government. He had overthrown his immediate predecessor, Joachim Yhombi Opango,
                    who had been made president after the assassination of the country's first
                    military leader and second president, Marion Ngouabi, who was a Communist to the
                    core. He had changed the flag so that it was a hammer and sickle on a red
                    background.</p>
                <p>The Congo in the mid 1980s still mouthed the Marxism Leninism rhetoric, and in
                    fact their best allies were the Soviets. The Soviets had a very large embassy
                    there. There were a lot of scholarships given to Congolese to study in the
                    Soviet Union. A fair number of them brought Soviet women back with them as
                    wives; so within the Brazzaville population you had a fair amount of Soviet
                    women married to Congolese. The Soviets occupied quarters right down by the port
                    where the ferry went back and forth to Kinshasa; it was a pretty interesting
                    location for them. They could pretty much see everything that was going back and
                    forth between Zaire and Congo, Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have relations with Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, there were relations. One could get back and forth. The ferries ran
                    every day. The two countries met periodically. Relations were not ever terribly
                    good, but I think that was a function of the various personalities. I think it
                    was a pretty much conscious attempt by Mobutu not to have very good relations
                    with any of his neighbors. The Congo's economy was driven principally by oil.
                    Despite the Marxist Leninist rhetoric, the principal trading partners remained
                    the French who basically ran the oil business to the extent that I think, if
                    anybody were to study it thoroughly, they would find that the French oil company
                    made an absolute fortune over the previous 40 or 60 years. American oil
                    companies, when I was there, were interested in some concessions and actually
                    got some concessions. Amoco and Conoco were present in the Congo, although
                    Conoco later backed out of most of its west African investments. Chevron was
                    down a little further south in Angola. There were some missionary groups who
                    were working in the north; they had been there for many years. That was the
                    extent of our American presence.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I first visited the Congo in late 1978 when we were just reopening our embassy
                    there. Our embassy had been closed at the time of the 1967 Arab Israeli war, and
                    we were just reopening it. We were hoping to have a Peace Corps program in the
                    Congo, but then came the coup that brought Sassou power, and all our efforts
                    stopped. We opened the embassy at a very low level. We had an ambassador and
                    maybe half a dozen people working there. The embassy grew slowly from that time,
                    from the late 1970s, till the time I went back in 1986. It was an interesting
                    time. Sassou was making overtures towards the West and was reducing, I think,
                    his dependence on the Soviets; he was openly interested in closer relations with
                    the United States. When I got there, he had just been named president of the
                    Organization of African Unitthe OAU. Historically the head of the OAU, when he
                    goes to New York for the UN General Assembly, has an opportunity to meet with
                    the American president; he comes on either a private visit or working visit as
                    the head of the OAU representing Africa. There was not a lot of interest in the
                    Reagan administration in meeting this avowedly Marxist Leninist military
                    dictator. We tried to make the case, as did the Bureau of African Affairs, that
                    Sassou was to be met not as the Congolese president but as the head of the OAU.
                    We had been reasonably successful in making this pitch in the first few weeks
                    that I was there in 1986. Then Sassou's foreign minister went to the UN General
                    Assembly. During the course of his remarks to the UN General Assembly, he
                    equated Zionism to racism, which was a whole new way of looking at Zionism. That
                    predictably really gave pause to the Israelis and their American friends in
                    Washington. I got a phone call from the deputy assistant secretary saying,
                    “Look, they have just queered any chance of a meeting with Reagan unless they do
                    something dramatic to basically denounce their foreign minister or otherwise
                    correct the record.” The ambassador asked me to go see the president's secretary
                    general to explain to him that something dramatic had to be done. The ambassador
                    suggested that I tell the secretary general that they ought to fire the foreign
                    minister.. In the car on the way to the presidential offices, I thought about it
                    for a while, and concluded that I really couldn't go so far as to tell them to
                    fire their foreign minister. I thought that they might take that rather badly. I
                    tried to finesse the issue by just saying that if they hoped to have a meeting
                    with our president, they were going to have to clarify the minister's statement
                    in a way that made it very, very clear that he had not been speaking on behalf
                    of the government. Then the secretary general asked me precisely what I had in
                    mind in terms of a dramatic way of making amends and I said, “Well, far be it
                    for me to suggest how you deal with issues that are really your own, but it has
                    been suggested in Washington that if the foreign minister were to lose his
                    position, that would be viewed positively by your friends in Washington.” Then I
                    left. I thought I had finessed it pretty well, but of course the secretary
                    general went right in to see the president and told him, “Wilson just came by
                    and said 'Fire the foreign minister.'" The secretary general then apparently
                    told Sassou, “The hell with that. We'll just get rid of Wilson. That'll show
                    them.” I've been told by a counselor close to the President, that a meeting was
                    held shortly thereafter which decided that I wasn't really a big enough fish to
                    be worthy of declaring persona non grata; so they didn't do anything. But for a
                    brief period of time, my credibility with the higher reaches of government was
                    pretty much compromised. Literally a few weeks later another counselor went to
                    see the president and said to him that “You know this story that Wilson said to
                    fire the foreign minister is just not true. You ought to take a look at the
                    minutes of the meeting, because there was a notetaker in that meeting.” So
                    Sassou called for the minutes, and the minutes of the meeting made it very clear
                    what I had said and what I hadn't said. Sassou was satisfied that I had not in
                    fact been interfering in the internal affairs of their country. My relationship
                    with him got better right after that.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>As for Sassou's visit to the United States, he went to Washington, but Reagan
                    wouldn't see him. They just wouldn't put him on Reagan's schedule. All we could
                    do was to get Reagan to call him. He was staying at the Willard Hotel. Reagan
                    gave him a call and said, “Welcome to Washington. I hope you're having a good
                    time, etc...,” after which Sassou hung up the phone and said, “That was very
                    nice of him to take the time to call me. Given that I'm literally only about 100
                    yards away, it would have been nice to have been able to go over there and shake
                    his hand.” He was quite right on that. It didn't stop the Congolese press,
                    however, from taking a picture of Reagan seated and picture of Sassou seated and
                    putting them together on the front page of their local government run newspaper,
                    suggesting that a meeting had taken place.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Substantively while I was in Brazzaville and during the time when Sassou was
                    president of the OAU, we worked very hard to do two things. One was to increase
                    the level of American investment in the Congo by supporting our petroleum
                    companies' efforts to expand their presence. And, two, in his capacity as
                    president of the OAU, Sassou had defined two Africa wide problems worthy of his
                    attention. One was debt relief, which was a nonstartejust not a major issue in
                    1986. It is now in 2001, but it wasn't then. The other one was the Angolan civil
                    war. There had been a hiatus in our discussions with the Angolans. There had
                    been no dialogue between the Americans and the Angolans or the Cubans or the
                    South Africans on the Angolan issue for the previous 18 months. Sassou wanted to
                    restart the dialogue. The Congolese were in a very good position to influence
                    the Angolan side because most of the leaders in the MPLA had been in Brazzaville
                    during the time that they were running their war against the Portuguese. Many of
                    them had occupied positions in the Congolese administration. Almost all of the
                    Angolan political leadership was friendly with the Congolese leadership; so
                    there was a good rapport. For 18 months, we worked with the Congolese to put
                    together a series of ideas to transmit to Washington. We found that the most
                    difficult part of putting the negotiating process back on track was convincing
                    our Assistant Secretary Chet Crocker that the Congolese were serious and could
                    deliver. Crocker held out; we finally sent somebody to Washington who was very
                    close to Sassoa very interesting character, a Malian author and politician, a
                    Maoist who had spent seven years in jail in the deserts of Mali in the 1970s
                    under Moussa Traore. This fellow had been a Modibo Keita guy, and when Traore
                    came to power he was thrown in jail. His name was Sadu Banian Penate, a well
                    known west African author and a well known west African Maoist at the time. He
                    left Mali and was in exile in the Congo serving as an adviser to Sassou. He and
                    I became very, very good friends. We sent him to Washington and he was actually
                    able to persuade Chet Crocker, who was not a Maoist, that Sassou was good for
                    his word and that he could deliver. Crocker described Sassou pretty much as I
                    have described him, but he also used terms like “Marxist Leninist lightweight
                    who enjoys his Pierre Cardin suits and reads Afrique Aziz as his weekly reading
                    material.” Afrique Aziz is a kind of socialist, left wing, lightweight news
                    magazine. We finally got Crocker to come out to test the waters. This was in the
                    middle or about the end of 1987 or just beginning of 1988. Crocker came to
                    Brazzaville. It was agreed that the Angolan minister of interior, who was
                    effectively the number two in that country would come from Rwanda to meet with
                    him. Crocker got out there, but the president of Angola had gone to India.
                    According to the Angolan rules of governance, the president and the minister of
                    interior could not both be out of the country at the same time. So Sassou sent
                    his airplane down to Rwanda with a very senior personal advisotheir ambassador
                    the UN, or somebody of that rank. They bundled up the Angolan minister of
                    interior and brought him to Brazzaville despite the fact that in leaving the
                    country the minister of interior was in violation of his country's rules of
                    governance. In any case, Sassou and the minister of interior met and that
                    relaunched the process. We went from that to having a quadripartite meeting with
                    the South Africans and the Cubans and the Angolans and ourselves, followed by a
                    series of negotiations that led to what is known as “the Brazzaville protocol to
                    the New York accords.” The New York accords effectively de internationalized the
                    civil war in Angola, got the Cuban the South African troops out of Angola. That
                    was a pretty significant piece of diplomacy; it was a lot of fun to work on it
                    and to watch. I think for Chet it was one of the big breakthroughs in the
                    management of the “constructive engagement” policy that he was trying to
                    implement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for the Congolese to work on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I think for Sassou it was a way of legitimizing himself in the eyes both
                    of Africa and of the United States, of the Western world. He was able to crown
                    his OAU presidency with a pretty significant success. I think that was part of
                    it. Also in retrospect the Angolans were coming under a lot of pressure, and
                    this was one way of the regime to ease some of the pressure on imilitary
                    pressure coming from the war against Savimbi by at least taking the South
                    Africans out of the equation and by moving forward on lessening the scope of the
                    conflict. But I think for Sassou it was principally a question of actually
                    accomplishing something during his tenure as president of the OAU. It was in our
                    interest to actually see that the Cubans go home. We didn't like the idea of
                    Cubans hanging around central Africa destabilizing governments or potentially
                    destabilizing governments or being in a position militarily to do that.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that the Malian intermediary was a committed Maoist and that
                    Sassou had Maoist tendencies. Where did this come from? Was it sort of a
                    homegrown thing, or where did this...</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>WILSON: I don't think Sassou was ever really a Maoist. I think Sassou was much
                    more steeped in Marxism and Leninism, principally as a political organizing
                    concept. Fundamentally the part of the concept that appealed to him was that he
                    and his cronies would control the levers of power in the name of “The Party”the
                    ruling party. I'll just talk first about the Conga lot of it came from a
                    vehement rejection by a highly politicized society of the yokes of colonialism
                    at the time of independence. As a consequence, they made a decision to go in
                    another direction from the direction under which they had labored for the 40,
                    50, 60 years being a colony of France. The people who in the early 1960s reached
                    out to the Congolese in a very successful way as the Cold War was being played
                    out in Africa, were the Soviets and their allies. They offered scholarships;
                    they offered military training; they offered political training. They had their
                    political people there helping to organize the party. The Congolese political
                    leaders, while they were military guys, operated through the party. I think that
                    was more than anything else that drove him. I don't think Sassou who is still
                    president now was motivated by a sense oMarxist Leninist principleall power to
                    the workerbut for him it was a question of providing controlling power to the
                    party, which was organized the same way the communist party was organized. Mali
                    was also a country that at the time of independence which rejected the French
                    pretty strongly and turned to those who would help them as they were being
                    isolated or ostracized by the French. At the same time they were ostracizing the
                    French. Keita was one of those who for some reason or another seemed to become
                    close friends with the Chinese. The Chinese were and are very, very active in
                    Africmajor commercial partners. All those things that the Africans need, whether
                    it is tin pots or silverware or the sorts of stuff you see in the open markets,
                    small trade type items, all are made in Chinnot unlike a lot of what we see. So
                    in both the Congo and Mali, I think it was a matter of turning to those who are
                    willing to extend the hand of friendship at a time that they were looking for
                    alternatives to the way that they had been governed by the colonial powers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned scholarships to the Soviet Union. My

                        Bulgariascholarships were really a two edged sword. They would invite
                        Africans to go to Moscow, Sophia or wherever, where they would be treated
                        like dirt. The Slavs don't take kindly to Africans. It's extremely apparent.
                        So this often backfired. Did you find any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think that's right in one sense. Most of the guys went to Leningrad.
                    That is where the big university ithe Patrice Lumumba University. They would go
                    there and they wouldn't be treated very well; so they would come back with not
                    fond memories of life in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it was higher
                    education; whether they liked the Soviet Union or not, their experience with
                    higher education was learning about life, whether it's politics or economics or
                    sociology, as it was taught by Soviet professors. As a consequence, whether you
                    liked the Soviets or not, the students' outlook on the world was going to be
                    somewhat slanted by the education that had gotten, which was considerably
                    different from the education that they would have gotten in Western Europe or
                    the United States. As I have said, I've always thought that the big mistake that
                    we made at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall was not doubling or tripling
                    our scholarship funds to these African countries and to other Third World
                    countries; this was the time when the Soviets and the East Germans and the
                    Cubans and others who had big scholarship funds were reducing theirs. I thought
                    so for two reasons: one, education has got to be the foundation for development
                    and for progress in these societies; and, two, there was just a wonderful
                    opportunity to step in there and bring a lot of people over to the States to
                    learn in our universities and to see our system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of the French, not only in intellectual
                        life but economic life and political life, in the Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You mentioned that studying in the Soviet Union or in Sophia, Bulgaria,
                    as being sort of a double edged sword. The relationship with the French is very
                    much the same in that there was a certain amount of resentment over the way that
                    the French continued to dominate the political and economic life of their former
                    colony. At the same time, the language in Brazzaville and Paris was the same;
                    there were historic ties; everybody had a relative who lived in France; people
                    went there on vacation. There were a lot of French in the city of Brazzaville;
                    that maintained a certain familiarity which to a certain extent overwhelmed the
                    contempt, not by much perhaps, but to some extent. It was very, very difficult
                    for these African countries to completely break their ties with the former
                    colonial power just because there was so much common history.</p>

                        relations with the Congolese, the French were in a way doing the same. Was
                        there a certain rivalry in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>WILSON: The rivalrwe're talking about 1986 to 1988 nowas on commercial matters.
                    The French government supported French commercial activities very aggressively
                    in their former colonies, and wherever they think they have an edge, they're
                    going to use. The French oil company, Elf Aquitaine, was and to a certain still
                    is a power unto itself. In Africa, Elf Aquitaine was the repository for French
                    intelligence operatives; it was used as a funneand this is now coming out now in
                    the French justice systefor money going to these former colonies and their
                    governments when it came time for elections. Some of the money came back when it
                    became time to fund French political parties at election time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're having big scandals going on now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Big scandals now. It'll take a number of people down. It'll be
                    interesting to watch. In a sense, there was always a rivalry. There was one case
                    where the French had developed a cloning process for eucalyptus trees in the
                    Congo. They were trying to produce stock for a paper mill plant, paper mill, but
                    they could never get the paper mill up and running very well. There were
                    literally hectare upon hectare upon hectare of eucalyptus trees, each of which
                    looked like the one next to it because they were all cloned, and each of which,
                    to an American eye, looked like telephone poles or electric poles that you would
                    use to string wires across countries. The French had been working on this
                    project for 20 years. They didn't have any idea as to what to do to
                    commercialize the product. An American came in and said, “Gee, these look like
                    telephone poles to me.” He worked a deal with the Congolese to take possession
                    of all these eucalyptus stands and was working hard on turning them into
                    telephone poles, shipping them out to Syria and to the Middle East and places
                    where they didn't have trees, but where there was a need to run a lot of power
                    lines. He was well on the road to commercialization of the tree stands. Then the
                    French stepped in and undercut him in a big way. They did it just as the French
                    can do everywhere, with a little money here or a little threat there and some
                    underhanded deal somewhere down the road. They managed to take that the stands
                    back, putting the American out of business. Those were the sorts of things that
                    we would occasionally come up against. By and large in the 1980s, there was a
                    tendency to allow the French to take the lead in areas that were not of
                    primordial importance to uand the Congo wasn't. “Constructive engagement” was
                    essentially a southern African policy, and that was the African focus at senior
                    levels of the American government at the time. When we had to deal with things
                    like Liberia, or if later on we had to deal with Mengistu in Ethiopia, we did so
                    on an emergency basis; “constructive engagement was where our continuing focus
                    was.</p>

                        that the real attention in the immediate area was on Zaire (Congo,
                        Kinshasa)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>WILSON: Very much so. Congo Kinshasa at the time had our largest single embassy
                    in Sub Saharan Africa. It was the largest, or the second largest, in terms of
                    personnel in the world if you include Foreign Service nationals. Everybody was
                    in Kinshasa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling or reflection you were getting from
                        the Congolese government towards Mobutu and what he was doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The sentiment towards Mobutu was that of all the neighboring countrieit
                    wasn't just in Brazzaville, but it was also in Burundi and to a certain extent,
                    although I wasn't up there very much, in Uganda. The sentiment amongst the
                    neighbors was that Mobutu was going to do everything he could to keep them weak
                    while making himself strong. That included efforts to destabilize his country.
                    The neighbors were always looking askance at Zaire and wondering what Mobutu
                    might be up to. They would go to the meetings in the region that Mobutu would
                    attend. Mobutu's was kind of the “big brother” or the potentially threatening
                    neighbor with whom you had to somehow make your peace with if you hoped to live
                    to fight another day. There was a lot of healthy concern about what Mobutu might
                    be up to and at the same time a recognition that they were relatively much
                    weaker than he and his ilk. This was in the 1980s before Mobutu's decline and
                    fall.</p>

                <p>WILSON: We had a Peace Corps staff in the Congo in the late 1970s and then
                    because there was a coup, that office closed. When I was there from 1986 to
                    1988, we had a lot of discussions about starting a Peace Corps program. We had
                    people coming in to make surveys, and we may have actually had an office open
                    towards the end of my tenure, but it was just getting barely off the ground at
                    that time. It's certainly obviously closed since then, in light of the renewed

                <p>WILSON: They had been there for a long time. There were not as many there as I've
                    seen elsewhere in Africa, but there were these odd familienot in the sense that
                    they were odd people but there were just a few families scattered here and there
                    in the north, principally working with the pygmy populations. We would see them
                    as they would come through Brazzaville but they pretty much kept to themselves.

                    reared its ugly head. That came about principally after I left when they got
                    involved in the liberalization of the political sector. They had their national
                    conference and brought all the political groups out of the woodwork. When they
                    began to develop political parties in the Congo, most of the parties then grew
                    up along tribal lines. That's not to say that there wasn't sort of tribalism; it
                    just wasn't on the surface visible to the untrained Western eye. The marriage
                    between Sassou and Antoinette, his wife, was essentially a marriage between the
                    north and the south. He was an M'bochi from Oyo, and she was a Vili from Pointe
                    Noire; so one was from the coast and one was from the north. The coastal
                    politics were the politics of oil and wealth, because they owned all the oil.
                    The M'bochi ran the military and the Vili had run commerce from the exterior
                    historically, which also happened to be where the oil fields were. So there was
                    a division there. This all got played out in Brazzaville which is Congo
                    territory I guess. Essentially there were the three different ethnic groups and
                    three political groupings that played out their rivalries in Brazzaville. Right
                    before I got there, there had been some problems between the south and the north
                    that had resulted in a couple of tribal leaders being thrown. The leader of the
                    southern grouthe mayor of Pointe Noirhad been convicted of terrorism in a real
                    public trial. It was on television everyday all day long. He was sentenced to 20
                    years in prison. He was later released and, as far as I know, is back in Pointe
                    Noire. The people in Brazzaville became more active as Sassou opened up the
                    political system.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that one of the jobs to get the Congo, Brazzaville off the “bad
                    countries” list maintained by Department of State because it had certainly been
                    there for some time?</p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, absolutely. We had had no relations with the Congo for a period of
                    10 or 12 yearsomething like that. Then we had had very modest relations with
                    them. They were not bad enough to be hostile because the Congo just wasn't
                    important enough to be hostile, but they were not friendly. We had a very small
                    mission in a country which hosted a very large Soviet mission and where the
                    Soviets really held sway. When I was there, it was at a time when the Congolese
                    were reaching out and trying to improve their relationship with the United
                    States; so one of our roles was to convey that desire to Washington and to
                    convey then to the Congolese what it is that they needed to do if in fact they
                    did want to get off our “bad countries” roster. Their involvement in the Angolan
                    peace process was clearly a way of doing it. Since we had initialed the
                    Brazzaville protocol in the fall shortly after I lefSeptember of 198and then we
                    signed the New York Accords in December of 1988 or January 1989, Sassou returned
                    to the United States and was able to meet with President Bush.. That was, I
                    think, in recognition of their efforts to play a positive role in the solution
                    of a regional problem. So to a certain extent we were successful in our
                    efforts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any diminution of Soviet efforts in that
                        part of Africa but particularly in the Congo? This was the time of the
                        Gorbachev reforms and perestroika and other things, so things were really
                        changing in the Soviet Union. I'm not sure if they're hit yet, but was there
                        any reflection of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: During the time that I was there, the DCM was the one who generally
                    represented the U.S. embassy at Soviet functions; that dates back really to the
                    invasion of Afghanistan. So both in Burundi and in the Congo I was the one who
                    basically went and hung out at the Soviet receptions when they had all their
                    military days or national days. I was the one who got to know the Soviets
                    diplomatically through this. In fact, from 1987 on, it was pretty clear that the
                    Soviet embassy was not getting the same sort of resources and the same sort of
                    support that it had been getting. The number of Soviet personnel was down.
                    Soviet activities in the country were down. Soviet interests in the Congo seemed
                    to be waning. I think towards the end of my tenure therthat would be the 1987
                    1988 time frame, we began to see some signs that the Soviets were lowering their
                    profile in that part of Africcertainly in the Congo. So, to a certain extent,
                    the answer to your question is “yes,” although it was not highly visible or
                    dramatic. It's certainly a far different Russian presence in Africa now than it
                    was when I was there; the change has been dramatic since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you view the Chinese influence there as benign,
                        hostile or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>WILSON: The Chinese influence has always been of a different nature. The Chinese
                    have a different way of looking at development assistance. They will offer you
                    development projects but the projects are designed to show what the Chinese can
                    do and generally involves a large Chinese worker presence. We would export
                    expertise. The Chinese would export workers who build roads or build stadiums or
                    build buildinge.g. National Assembly buildings. They were pretty good at that.
                    Then their development people would stay in the country and bid on international
                    projects. So if they had a development project to build a National Assembly,
                    then they would bring 600 or 700 people over to do thaworkers that would build
                    the National Assemblwho then they would stay on and bid on World Bank projects
                    or on other international opportunities. They would establish a worker presence
                    in the country, who pretty much stayed by themselves. They were autonomous. They
                    were self sufficient. You rarely saw them in town except when they came in to
                    sell vegetables or buy things at the store. Their diplomatic presence was
                    significant but not in any way hostile. They didn't fight the Cold War against
                    us the same way that the Soviets did. You could go to a Chinese reception and be
                    treated nicely. You go to a Soviet reception and you would have to fight the
                    “kitchen debate” with the Soviet Third Secretary who happened to be half smashed
                    on vodka just because he thought that he would have a good Congolese audience to
                    listen to him rant and rave. That happened to me several times. The Chinese were
                    more polite. I always thought that the Chinese offered a pretty good “south
                    south” type relationship to these African countries. They made products which
                    were very cheap and the Africans provided a ready market for a lot of them. I've
                    always thought that we ought to really worry more about the Chinese in Africa if
                    we really care to maintain some influence or not to lose some of our influence.
                    Today that might not be terribly important, but if you have a constellation of
                    powers supporting China, including all of Africa, someday that might be
                    important to protecting our interests in the international forum.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The Libyans had a very good relationship with the Congolese. There were
                    some Libyan officers operating there under cover of a Libyan timber company.
                    They were the ones who were the principal suspects in the planting of the bombs

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No; we had a pretty good little embassy. Allen was there for the first
                    year I was there, and theLen Shurtleff was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Len Shurtleff was there as ambassador the second year I was there.
                    Actually the Congo was an interesting period for me because I was the one who
                    was responsible for all the activities dealing with Angola; I'd be running back
                    and forth between Bodion, who was working for Sassou, and the ambassador. We
                    would meet two or three times a week, Sassou and Bodion and me. The ambassador
                    and I would get together maybe once a month or once every six weeks to go over
                    things and talk about what was happening on Angola. Then we would get the
                    principalis together a couple times, a couple or three times, to discuss the
                    situation. That was a lot of fun. Towards the end of that, Crocker's special
                    assistant flew out to Brazzaville to see me. He was a guy by the name of Robert
                    Cabelly. We went out to lunch, and he said, “Look, Crocker wants you to know
                    that he thinks you've done a great job on this, and he wants to reward you by
                    giving you any job you want. So what job would you like? I will carry back your
                    wish to Crocker, and we'll make it happen.” I said, “Well, the only thing I've
                    every really wanted in the Foreign Service was to be the “Africa watcher” in our
                    embassy in Paris. I've been in Africa now for the better part of 10 years, and
                    I'd really like to follow events here from Paris.” So Cabelly said, “All right,
                    you've got it. Not a problem.” He got on the airplane, and while he was flying
                    back from Brazzaville to Washington... Remember that even in the 1980s, if you
                    wanted to make a phone call to Washington, it often took three days; if you
                    wanted to call Kinshasa, you would have to call through Paris and Brussels and
                    back down to Kinshasa, which could take days as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Sometime before Cabelly returned to Washington, the wife of a good friend of
                    mine, who was serving in New York, got a job in Paris working for USIA. She used
                    to work for me in Pretoria. This friend calls up Crocker and says, “My wife just
                    got a job in Paris. What can you do for me?” Crocker, not knowing that I wanted
                    the job in Paris, said, “Not a problem. You can have the “Africa watch” job.”
                    When Cabelly got back to Washington, he told Crocker that I wanted that Paris
                    job. Crocker said, “Damn. I've already given it away.” So the booby prize for
                    not having gotten the Paris job was Baghdad as DCM in 1988. That was the next
                    job I had. Curiously, my friend, who was currently Deputy Chief of Mission in
                    The Hague, has never forgiven me for having gotten Baghdad while he got Paris.
                    He was slogging through the trenches in another Foreign Service job, a mid
                    career job, while I'm sitting out in Baghdad on CNN virtually every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, let's pick up on Baghdad then. In the first
                        place, how did this hit you when you got told this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I had had on a number of assignments; this was one of those times in my
                    career when I thought it was probably useful to get out of Africa. I'd been in
                    Africa for a long time, and I needed to do something elsput my foot in some
                    other bureau. I bid on Algiers, Kathmandu and maybe a half dozen other DCM jobs,
                    because by this time it was pretty clear that “conal” niche was the DCM world
                    more than the administrative world. I wasn't going to be “reconed” as a
                    political officer. I had good DCM experiences. I'd spent five years as a DCM, so
                    I bid on other DCM jobs. I didn't want to go back to Washington. I got a call,
                    or a message, from my career development officer saying, “Look, you're in the
                    running obviously for all these DCM jobs, but you ought to know that for
                    Kathmandu there's 142 people who want to be the DCM there. For Algiers the
                    ambassador hasn't yet been named, but the ambassador undoubtedly is going to
                    want to take his or her own person. These are not sure things. But would you be
                    interested in going to Baghdad?” Nobody's bidding on Baghdad. It was the middle
                    of the Iran Iraq War. “Would you like us to put your name forward?” I thought
                    about it, and concluded what the heck, why not. It might be very interesting. I
                    said, “Sure. Put my name forward.” I talked to the ambassador, and the match up
                    between what she wanted and what I had to offer was pretty good. She wanted
                    somebody with management experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>WILSON: The ambassador was April Glaspie. She wanted somebody with management
                    experience, somebody who'd help her take this embassy that had been sort of a
                    backwater operation during the Iran Iraq War and make it, in the aftermath of
                    the war, an embassy in an important Middle Eastern country at an important time.
                    The Faustian deal was that, in exchange, she would teach me all there was to
                    know about our role in the Middle East, in which I had no experience. She was,
                    and is, a real master of Middle East. She knows it very, very well. She knows
                    all the players. She knows all the issues backwards and forwards. So it was a
                    great opportunity. I said “yes,” not knowing that the Near East Bureau is an
                    entity unto itself, which even if nobody bids on a DCM job in a place like
                    Baghdad, resents the idea that an outsider would useful, particularly one who
                    was not an Arabist. I went ahead and took the job, and had a hell of a time. It
                    was a great job. But the day I received the official communication saying that I
                    had been approved also was the day that the Herald Tribune headlines boldly
                    stated that the missile war had resumed between Tehran and Baghdad. They were
                    lobbing these scud missiles back and forth between the two capitals. We had with
                    mixed feelings when we read the message assigning us to Baghdad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a wife and family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I had a wife. My kids were living in California, with their mother. They
                    would come out every summer either to France or to the Congwherever we were.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Baghdad on Labor Day of 1988 and left on January 12, 1991. I arrived
                    at a time when Iran and Iraq had signed their cease fire as called for by UN
                    Security Council Resolution 598 which was a step forward for negotiating their
                    differences. So the two countries were not at war when I arrived, but the Iraq
                    regime had just gassed its Kurdish population in the north and photos of that
                    were just beginning to seep out into the international media. Saddam was under a
                    fair amount of international criticism for gassing his own populatiocriticism
                    well merited. We arrived at a very, very interesting time in the history of US
                    Iraqi relations.</p>

                    had a commercial office, we had a defense attach�, we had a USIA office, and
                    then we had the usual State functions. We were pretty well staffed up. We were
                    located right along the river in a nice part of town. Our political focus was
                    basically how do we deal with a very bellicose, thuggish regime in the aftermath
                    of a 10 year war with Iran. Virtually everything that regime did was an affront
                    to our own value system; yet it was an important player in Gulf politics and, as
                    a consequence, in Arab politics, where its enormous wealth and power and
                    military might made it a force to be reckoned with. All of our Arab friends in
                    the region were telling us that Saddam was a changed man as a consequence of the
                    Iran Iraq War and that we should not isolate him, but rather that our policy
                    ought to embrace him and attempt to weave a cocoon of moderation around him,
                    both to reinforce his new maturity after 10 years of war and also to encourage a
                    continued move towards moderate and more expansive behavior. This was the Arab
                    take on the situation, which showed in their relationships with him by and
                    large, with the exception maybe of Kuwait which had a somewhat different slant
                    on the situation. So to the extent to which we could, we tried to develop a
                    relationship with was some substance to it.</p>
                <p>With Iraq we had gone from 1967 to 1972 without having any presence in Baghdad
                    whatsoever. From 1972, we'd had an interest section located in the Belgian
                    embassy. We'd had one person staffing the interest section whom we raised to be
                    charg� when we opened our embassy. Subsequently we elevated that position to the
                    ambassador level through a series of moves throughout the 1980s. By the time
                    April and I got there in 1988, we were looking at ways to actually put some meat
                    on the bones of this relationship. The theory was that if we had something to
                    lose and they had something to lose, there might be more incentives to try to
                    find ways of accommodating our concerns on human rights and other issues. One of
                    the tools in our diplomatic toolbag was agricultural credits, which was one of
                    our major programs with Iraq. At the height of this program, we had extended
                    about a billion dollars of commodity credits to Iraq which came under some
                    criticism for being the second largest program in the world after Mexico. In
                    fact, for one year, our Iraq program was larger than Mexico's.</p>
                <p>At the same time that people were becoming critical and concerned about the size
                    of the program, we were just then beginning to realize that we were actually
                    getting more of a return on our investment every year than we were actually
                    investing giving us a net advantage. The agricultural credits was one of the
                    most important programs we had in place.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>We also actively supported U.S. business efforts to help rebuild Iraq.
                    Westinghouse, General Electric, everybody was in there trying to build up the
                    infrastructurelectric grids, power plants, and things like that. Our
                    relationship with Iraq was always tough. Shortly after I got there, we had
                    people who wanted to travel around the country. To get permission to do that,
                    they had to give the Iraqis three weeks' advance notice if they wanted to go
                    beyond 25 miles outside of Baghdad; if permission was granted, then you had to
                    be escorted or followed. One's freedom to poke around was inhibited in any way
                    the Iraqis could do it. Iraq itself was probably one of the two most paranoid
                    countries in the world, vying with North Korea for the number one spot. Yet it
                    was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>The Iraqis were very interesting people. They have a finely honed sense of their
                    own history. They have an intellectual class that is the equal of any
                    intellectual class in any other society even at a time they lived under this
                    truly brutal dictatorship. The markets were great to visithe kilims and the rugs
                    and the copper and all the stuff that you could find in these places. Iraq is
                    the heart of the Old Testament, with its ruins of Mesopotamia and Babylonia. It
                    was interesting in that respect.</p>
                <p>We were of interest to the Iraqis during this time because of our position on the
                    UN Security Council. When I first got there, the Iraqis were embarked upon a
                    campaign to persuade the Council of their positions on the issues related to the
                    implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 598. To persuade us of their
                    position, we would be invited, or convoked, maybe once every couple of months to
                    what amounted to a seminar on Persian hegemonic ambitions and designs over the
                    previous 150 years. The Iraqis would get out their maps and show us how the
                    Persians have been encroaching on the Shatt al Arab over literally the last 150
                    years; where the border was in 1850; where it was in 1910 and where the Iranians
                    tried to redraw the bordehere, here and there. Much of the relationship between
                    Iran and Iraq was often played out through the Kurds. There were Iranian Kurdish
                    dissident groups supported in the northwest by the Iraqis. Some Iraqi Kurdish
                    dissident groups were in exile in Iran supported by the Iranians and operating
                    out of Iranian territory to try to undermine the Iraqi government. Politics
                    within Iraq were always very interesting. We had the Shia in the south and the
                    so called “Marsh Arabs” in southern Iraq. Of the three significant Shia shrines,
                    one is in Baghdad and the two are in southern Iraq. It was an interesting mix,
                    sort of conflicting alliance, with the Arab Shias, the Iranian Shias, the Kurds
                    in the nortboth Iranian and Iraqi Kurds. All of that got played out in countries
                    that were destabilized.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>When I first got there, right after the end of the Iran Iraq War, the Iraqis had
                    brought back to Baghdad war booty that they had captured at the front. In New
                    Baghdad, they had created a fairgrounmiles upon milefor Iranian war
                    booteverything from helmets with bullet holes in them to light weaponry to heavy
                    equipment, tanks and armored personnel carriers, trucks, bulldozers and things
                    like that. You could walk for miles up and down this field and see all this
                    equipment that they had captured. It gave you a real sense of the enormity of
                    the war. If you remember, between 1980 and 1990, we all got pretty numb to this
                    land war that was going on and on and on. But once you got to Iraq and you were
                    living in a country of 17 20 millionot counting the 1 million who had lost their
                    lives in the previous decade on the Iran Iraq front. As Tariq Aziz said in one
                    of the few truthful statements I ever heard him mutter, virtually every Iraqi
                    family had somebody in their family who had been lost in the Iran Iraq War. It
                    had been a terrible, terrible war for the Iraqi population, and you could see
                    that. Saddam attempted to run a guns and butter economy. He wanted to pay a
                    peace dividend to his country in terms of increased imports of products wanted
                    by the population, but at the same time he wanted to maintain a significant
                    military machine including 1 million soldiers at the front and another 1 million
                    who were basically guarding the oil pipelines. That's a very significant
                    military. He had already mortgaged a good part of his future prosecuting the
                    Iran Iraq War, and his post war program required an additional debt burdethe
                    money had to come from somewhere. Hence, as we approached 1990, tensions began
                    to emerge between Iraq and Kuwait. Kuwait had been a major financier of the war
                    effort; it had financed a lot of the war effort through loans rather than just
                    grant funds for development assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your Iraqi contacts about the
                        value of the war? Was anybody able to question it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Nobody would question the Saddam regime; it was not done in Irain polite
                    Iraqi society. Saddam came to the presidency through the security apparatus,
                    and, in his years of running the security apparatus, had created a number of
                    concentric and overlapping circles of intelligence services. Some people
                    estimated that perhaps there were as many as seven, some of which existed just
                    to spy on the other ones. We used to say that, if you wanted to do your Iraqi
                    friends a favor, the best thing you could do for them would be never to be seen
                    with them. I have been told that very senior Iraqi officials would be invited to
                    dinners by other Iraqis. The next day, the host Iraqis would have to go in and
                    explain to the intelligence people what the senior officials had said at the
                    dinneand these people were presumably close to the leadership. There was no open
                    dialogue, real candid dialogue, on what the Iran Iraq War meant other than what
                    the official word which was essentially that Iraq was defending the Arab worlin
                    the broadest sense of the teragainst Persian hegemonic ambitions along the Shatt
                    al Arab. Tariq used to say that, “We defended, with the blood of our sons, Arab
                    independence against the Persian onslaught.”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The Iraqis would take the spouses of ambassadors to some of the key battlefields
                    and show them exactly how the battle had played out along the coast, for
                    example. They went there and took pictures of what that battle was all about.
                    That was one of the really big battles in the Iran Iraq War. You'd go down to
                    Basra and see that along the waterfront of the Shatt al Arab there were statues
                    of Iraqi generals who had given their lives in the Iran Iraq War. There were
                    those who said that the Iraqi military pension policy was to give a general a
                    bullet in the head about the same time you gave him his third or fourth star to
                    prevent the development of a cadre of military officers who might form the
                    nucleus of a threat for Saddam autocratic power; that was probably pretty
                    accurate. There were a lot of generals who just disappeared or just died. It was
                    a very brutal regime.</p>
                <p>During the time that we were there, there were a number of interesting things
                    that we did. Chevrolet came in and basically displaced Volkswagen as the
                    automobile of choice in Iraq. The Iraqis all made it very clear that, despite
                    the fact that we hadn't had relations with them for so many years, they were
                    interested in having American products as opposed to those of other countries.
                    In the two and a half years that I was there, the vehicle fleet literally turned
                    over so that Chevrolets became the vehicle of choice in Iraqi society. These
                    were Chevrolets made in Canada, although it's hard to, even in Iraqi minds as
                    well as ours, to view a Chevrolet as a Canadian product. I used to say that if
                    you had only one time to be in the Middle East and one place to be, this was the
                    time and Iraq was the place, because it was involved in everything. They had
                    just emerged from the Iran Iraq War. They were asserting themselves as a leader
                    of the Arab League, and they were taking positions on the Arab Israeli conflict,
                    as they always had beepositions that some U.S. Senators initially thought that
                    might serve as a basis for moderation the position of the Arab states on
                    Palestinian issues.</p>
                <p>We had an inspection team look over our operation. Senator Larry Pressler came
                    out a couple times to talk to them about various issues. Yasser Arafat would
                    come to town all the time; he took refuge in Baghdad when he wasn't living
                    somewhere else. His relationship with Saddam later almost cost the Palestinians
                    any sort of power and authority in their quest.</p>
                <p>One other interesting issue that we worked on during the first year or year and a
                    half of my tour was Lebanon. The Iraqis saw Beirut and Lebanon as an opportunity
                    to get back at Syria for what they viewed as Assad's betrayal of the Arab cause
                    by the position he took on the Iran Iraq War. The Iraqis quite openly were
                    sending these frog surface to surface missiles from Baghdad to Beirut through
                    Aqaba. We actually intercepted a ship to keep it from landing in Beirut; it
                    turned back. As April Glaspie pointed out to Tariq Aziz, the Iraqis found
                    themselves in a very odd position as a tacit ally of Israel by supporting
                    General Aoun in his efforts to keep Beirut free of Syrian interference. For the
                    Iraqis it had nothing to do with Israel; it had much more to do with giving
                    Assad a bloody nose and using Beirut as a way to do it. The road to Damascus
                    from Baghdad went through Beirut.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting a reading on what Saddam was up to? There
                        was a quite a debate, as I recall it, over what his purpose was. He was
                        going after major weapons systems, long range artillery and everything. Were
                        we looking hard at that to try to figure out what this was all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, sure; we watched it very carefullas carefully as we could given the
                    sort of meager resources at our disposal. We had an aggressive program to try
                    and find out everything we could about his nuclear, chemical and biological
                    weapons development programs. If he in fact had used chemical weapons, that was
                    something of great concern. So we watched with great interest every time that
                    they would come up with some reverse engineered type program. They came up with
                    a cannon at one point; they had this long gun, which didn't work very well. It
                    was fascinating to watch. We were not the most effective and we were certainly
                    not the most aggressive in subverting what they were doing. I think the
                    Israelis' intelligence services was ahead of us on that score. There were people
                    who developed the big gun working with the Iraqis; they were found dead in odd
                    places around Europe as they got closer to sort of realizing their goals. The
                    Israelis, who had already blown up the Iraqi's nuclear reactor once, were
                    watching developments very closely as well. We did everything we could, given
                    our resources, to try and make sure that we had a handle on those programs. I'm
                    not sure even to this day that we had a perfect understanding of what's going
                    on, but we were certainly concerned about it and we followed it. We ran a lot of
                    stuff at the time to keep tabs on what the Iraqis were doing
                    internationally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there concerns about our relations with Irawe were
                        too close or not. Was that an issue that was being played out in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Clearly, when the Iraqis gassed the Kurds, that was a real problem for a
                    lot of people including people up on the Hill. Claiborne Pell was Chairman of
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at that time. He had a guy on his staff,
                    Peter Galbraith, who later went on Zagreb as ambassador in the Clinton
                    Administration, who was very concerned about what was happening in Iraq and what
                    Saddam was doing. He and Pell brought a lot of pressure to bear, and they forced
                    us to really think about the sort of relationship we were having with the
                    Iraqis. We shared their concerns. We were under no illusions that this was
                    anything other than a very brutal regime. The question was always which was the
                    better approach. Was it to isolate them like we treated Libya and Cuba, or would
                    it be better to develop a network of relations with them to encouraged moderate
                    behavior because moderate behavior might lead to better relations? The aim was
                    to discourage extremist behavior because those circumstances could potentially
                    lose what we already achieved in terms of improving substantive relations,
                    whether in the commercial or political areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>We felt that a better approacand it was not just us; all our friends in the Arab
                    world were counseling us the same wato an Iraq that was emerging from a terrible
                    war with Iran, was to encourage moderation by developing a whole network of
                    relationships that would benefit both parties. Those relationships would provide
                    the anchor which would stabilize the relations as the political wind blew back
                    and fortpolitical winds being generated principally by Iraq and Saddam. When he
                    would arrest generals and shoot them, if we had a relationship that basically
                    established constraints on Iraqi temptation to do something more outrageous, we
                    would then be able to moderate their behavior over the long term; that was
                    something that was just generally believed by the Arab world as well. I wouldn't
                    say it was forced upon us, but I would say that to a large extent, the Arab
                    counsel was to do that, and that counsel was accepted at the highest reaches of
                    our government. So, even as we would produce these human rights report which
                    were, I think, accurate in their depiction of Iraq as a brutal totalitarian
                    regime, at the same time were we attempting to put into place policies and
                    programs that would provide some substance to our relationship in the hopes that
                    that would then moderate Iraqi behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Baghdad, how did April Glaspie use you?
                        Could you all communicate with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: First and foremost, April used me basically to be the chief operating
                    officer in the embassy, although she was very much a hands on person herself.
                    But I managed the operation in the sense of directly supervising all the
                    elements and serving as the go between her and the staff. We put into place a
                    large scale program designed to turn our embassy, in the aftermath of the Iraq
                    Iran war, into a real embassy rather than an outpost on the front line of a
                    major war. That involved coming up with new staffing patterns, coming up with a
                    new budget, making significant equipment buys. We had the undersecretary for
                    management come out and take a look at the sort of space we needed. We were
                    negotiating a settlement with the Iraqi government on property that they had
                    taken from uour old embassy of 20 years earlier worth about $35 40 million. We
                    were looking to buy new property. We were going through all the classic stuff
                    that one does when one is establishing a significant organization, including
                    spending a fair amount of money to do so. That is what I spent much of my time
                    on.</p>
                <p>The other thing I did as DCM was to serve as counselor to the ambassador and to
                    be her alter ego; she was very good about making us about as interchangeable as
                    we could be. So I spent a lot of time with her learning about the Gulthe issues,
                    the players, the position of the United States on issues, where the strength and
                    weaknesses were in various positions, the role of the Arab League in politics,
                    etc. This was material that I had to learn since I was in a region with which I
                    was not been terribly familiar. In that respect it was a great learning
                    experience. As I said earlier, the Iraqis helped on that because they had made
                    it a goal of their policy to try and persuade us of their position on UN
                    Security Council Resolution 590; we had a lot of exchanges with the Iraqis on
                    those issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That resolution dealt with what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That was the resolution that dealt with the aftermath of the Iran Iraq
                    War. It provided the framework for the two parties to negotiate a peaceful
                    settlement. So we had a lot of exchanges with the Iraqis literally from day one.
                    I used to see everybody from Tariq Aziz on down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that we had been helpful during the
                        Iran Iraq War by supplying satellite information and things like that. Was
                        there any residue of good will?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. The Iraqis always took the position that we never did anything that
                    wasn't in our national interest and, therefore, we earned no brownie points with
                    them for having done something that was totally in our own interest. On the
                    other hand, we did earn a fair amount of criticism from the Iraqis whenever it
                    was suggested that we had done something to benefit the Iranians. For example,
                    at one point we were accused of having given the Iranians the Iraqi order of
                    battlwhether done deliberately or through some loose talk that got into the
                    newspapers. The Iraqis used to always accuse us of having favored the Iranians
                    because of that. One of the early negotiations that we were involved had to do
                    with a resolution of an Iraqi attack on a US destroyer cruiser, the Stark,
                    during which 34 sailors had been killed or injured and which caused a
                    significant amount of damage to the ship. We actually were able to negotiate the
                    first payment of that. We negotiated with them and received some
                    compensation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Shah had had a hell a lot of American equipment, and
                        Iraq had a lot of Soviet equipment. Were there any comparison made and
                        lessons learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: To the extent to which the Iraqis learned any lessons, they learned the
                    wrong ones. If they thought that by having held the Iranian military to a
                    stalemate, they might somehow concluded that their equipment was as good as the
                    Iranian American equipment. They were dead wrong. As we moved into the Gulf War,
                    that was one of the things that we, the embassy in Baghdad, wanted to make sure
                    that they understoothat this was not going to be a military action along the
                    lines of the one that they had just fought against Irathis would be an entirely
                    different war.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The Iran Iraq War?</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>WILSON: Having gotten there after the last battle was fought, there wasn't a lot
                    of sort of post mortems to be done. I guess principally the most sort of
                    shocking and surprising result of the was the level of casualties and how a
                    population of 17 million could take as many casualties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the Battle of the Verdun played over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In fact, that's exactly right. I think that we really saw in the Iran
                    Iraq War, a replay oWorld War I complete with mustard gas and rudimentary
                    chemical weapons, and with trench warfare and sort of slogging it out on a front
                    line forever and ever and ever with very little forward movemenno more than five
                    kilometers one way or the other, during the course of the 10 years of the war.
                    One thing became very clear. As we extrapolate the Iran Iraq conflict into the
                    Gulf War, one of the real weaknesses of the Iraqi military tactics and strategy
                    was their ability to have effective logistics. They could move their troops, but
                    they couldn't get the logistic support to them. This became again very clear
                    when they invaded Kuwait. They just couldn't go any further because they had
                    outrun their supply lines. If you look at the Iran Iraq War, you can see that.
                    They could get troops five miles down the road, but then they couldn't support
                    their forward position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with the government, you mentioned Tariq Aziz. He
                        had a whole series of positions while you were there. Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Tariq was Foreign Minister at that time. Tariq is a very interesting
                    character. He speaks very good English, although, as far as I know, he has never
                    been educated outside Iraq. All his education was in Iraqi schools. As a
                    Christian, Tariq had no independent political base whatsoever; he owed
                    everything to Saddam; so he was kind of a loyal flunkiI used to tell people that
                    Tariq Aziz is somebody who is very bright and very articulatfar brighter and far
                    more articulate than I will ever be - and very powerful through the authority
                    that he got from Saddam. He used articulate the position of his government, his
                    country, with great authority. Yet the bottom line on Tariq is what you say to
                    yourself when you go to a used car locan you trust the salesman? In Tariq's
                    case, you couldn't. I would never trust him particularly when we are talking
                    about the Gulf War. I had some experiences with him that proved that I couldn't
                    trust him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Tariq the person the embassy went through? Was there
                        any direct contact with Saddam Hussein?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>WILSON: Saddam almost never met an ambassador. When one presented his or her
                    letters of accreditation, the letters were always taken by Izzat Ibrahim or by
                    Yassin Ramadan, who were Saddam's two chief lieutenants. Saddam would meet
                    ambassadors only when they were escorting distinguished visitors from their own
                    country to a meeting that had been granted with Saddam. So the only times that
                    we met Saddam during the two and a half years that I was there were either when
                    people like Arlen Specter and other Senators came to Baghdad. John Kelly met one
                    time with Saddam when he was assistant secretary of State. There were the two
                    occasions for meetings with Saddam as events were leading up to the Gulf War :
                    April Glaspie saw him on July 26th and then when I saw him 10 or 11 days later
                    on August 6th. Those were the only two times that anybody can remember our
                    meeting with him when we weren't escorting a VIP or a part of a Congressional
                    delegation. Those two were the only one on one meetings. April might have met
                    with him one other time, but I just don't remember.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where we able to tap into the mafia in the town of
                        Tikrit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Most of our with Iraqis were in very formal channels, and most of our
                    relations with the Iraqi government went through Nezar Hamdun. He was the
                    undersecretary. He had been in Washington as the head of the Iraqi Interests
                    section, then as ambassador, had returned to Baghdad to become the
                    undersecretary. He was basically the guy that handled U.S. relations. So
                    virtually everything that we had to do went through him first. We could then
                    have a series of other relationships within the foreign ministry depending on
                    the nature of the business. Our contacts would be with the protocol office or
                    the desk officer or with Tariq occasionally or with the office director
                    depending on the issue. Relations beyond that with the broader Iraqi community
                    were very rare. We had some of it with Hussein Kamel, who was the minister of
                    industry and military industrialization. He was Saddam's son in law who later
                    fled to Jordan and then decided he could come back because he was told all was
                    forgiven, only to return to be shot. We had some relationship with the minister
                    of commerce and the minister of agriculture because of the specific programs
                    that we were funding. But those relationships were very perfunctory, very
                    formalistic and were not terribly authentic. As I said earlier, we had a saying
                    at the embassy that the best thing that you could do for your Iraqi friends is
                    never be seen with them. Normally, Iraqis could not come to our houses; only on
                    very rare occasions did they show uprimarily those very few who had this
                    permission to circulate in the broader international community. There were
                    really only about a half a dozen of them, and you sort of had to wonder what
                    their role in all of this was. But, by and large, there were really very, very
                    fein fact, virtually nonmeaningful relationships that allowed us to actually sit
                    with an Iraqi and talk about issues and get something other than the party
                    line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of other embassies? Was it sort of
                        like Moscow in the bad old days when everybody went to other embassies and
                        asked what's going on and trying to share this information maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>WILSON: Because the contacts with Iraqis were so few and far between, the main
                    avenue for gathering of information came by attending all National Day
                    celebrations. There were 110 embassies, so there were 110 National Days. Because
                    the Iraqis were a significant military power and had just fought a significant
                    war, there were military attach�s attached to all embassies. So depending on
                    whether a country had one military day or whether each service had its own day,
                    you would have another 110 odd military days. That meant than on 250 days of the
                    year you were out at one reception or another. That was the way we figured out
                    who was seeing whom and who was saying what to whom; there was a lot of gossip
                    that went on in these receptions. Now we, as I mentioned earlier, because of the
                    nature of our relationship with the Iraqis, were often the ones who were the
                    providers of information on contacts with the Iraqis because we had lots of
                    them. On the other hand, the Soviets had some very experienced hands assigned to
                    Baghdad. As we moved to the Gulf War, this became increasingly the case
                    especially with the emergence of Primakov, who was a close personal friend of
                    Saddam. Their DCM, my counterpart, was a guy by the name of Sasha Kalugin, who
                    was the son of Kalugin, the KGB guy who's written a couple books. Some other
                    embassies that were particularly gooe.g the Egyptian embassy was very good
                    because there were 4 million Egyptians in the country; so they had lots of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were rebuilding Babylon; they were doing a lot of manual labor that
                    the Iraqis didn't do anymore. They basically filled a void. As all Iraqis men
                    became soldiers, Egyptians came in and did the road work. And the Turks were
                    also active. The Turks had an ambassador there who's currently their ambassador
                    in Paris. He went from Iraq to be the Turkish ambassador to the European Union
                    in Strasbourg, and then he went to be the head of Turkish Central Intelligence
                    organization and then to Paris. He was a very distinguished Turkish diplomat and
                    a very savvy guy; they had a good embassy there. Because of the nature of their
                    relationship with Iraqis, i.e., big trade back and forth across the border, they
                    had lots of good information and lots of good insights into what was happening
                    in Iraq.</p>
                <p>Q: This was prior to the build up of the Gulf War. How about the Kurd situation?
                    Were you following that?</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, we followed it a lot. One of our key employees was a Kurd. His clan
                    had been pretty much coopted by the Iraqi regime, but he was still able to give
                    us a fair amount of insight into what was going on. The head of the Kurdish
                    Democratic Party, KDP, was a good friend of ours. He was based in the mountains
                    outside of Sulaymaniyah in Iraq; he used to come in fairly often and give us
                    some good insight into what was going on up there. So we had pretty good Kurdish
                    contacts. We couldn't get to their area as often as we wanted because of travel
                    restrictions. I actually got up to the Iranian border during the second year of
                    my tour when restrictions were loosening up; I got up to Ronya, Rawanduz and
                    Sulaymaniyah and up to Mosul and Irbil, which are primarily Kurdish and Iraqi
                    Christian towns in the north. We were able to follow Iraqi efforts to move the
                    Kurds out of sensitive areas to other towns and historic villages. We would
                    build other villages for them and things like that. So we followed that and we
                    followed the various discussions that were going on between Kurdish groups and
                    then between the Kurds and the Iraqi government as they were working through all
                    their political issues. The Kurds, when they weren't fighting the Iraqis and the
                    Arabs, were fighting each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the classic problem of trying to establish
                        relations with a brutal regime like Saddam's, while some junior officers
                        were saying, “This is terrible?” I was just wondering whether you had
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I suppose to a certain extent we did. We didn't have that many junior
                    officers who were qualified to be “bomb throwers.” They were mostly first tour
                    officers who didn't have enough experience to really be that. Baghdad was a
                    tough post to fill; we had some people who may have been disgruntled for other
                    reasons other than that. During my confirmation hearings for Gabon, I got
                    nothing but questions on Iraq; all the questions related to how we approached
                    the human rights issue. I could truthfully say that we were very clear eyed in
                    our criticism of the brutality of the Iraqi regime, as stated in our annual
                    human rights reports. I don't think that we were under any illusions that this
                    was a good regime and that it was worthy of our magnanimity. On the other hand,
                    we made a conscious decision that the best way to encourage future moderated
                    behavior was to develop a network of relations based on our own interests and
                    the commonly perceived interests both with Iraq and with the region. This
                    position, I think, enabled us to a certain extent to ward off whatever criticism
                    of the brutality of the regime there might have been. Now, there were instances
                    when people were absolutely disgusted with what the Iraqis were doinwhether it
                    was “PNGing” one of our employees or whether it was killing an Iranian
                    journalist whose girlfriend happened also to be the girlfriend of one of our
                    employees. There were incidents like that. Certainly there was general revulsion
                    at the Iraqi regime but not a lot of opposition to what we were trying to
                    accomplish with our approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>So the basic tenets of our policy in the aftermath of the Iran Iraq War were to
                    encourage Iraqi moderation through a series of incentives including the
                    Agricultural Commodity Credit Program, commercial relations, etc. This policy
                    was not developed unilaterally, but it was conceived with the support and advice
                    of our Arab friends in the region who told us that Saddam had been through this
                    bloody war and had moderated his approach. Even if he hadn't moderated, they
                    thought that this was the best way to deal with this tiger in their midsto weave
                    a commercial and trading and investment cocoon around him that created
                    disincentives to lash out as he had done in the past. So that was what we
                    did.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, we did not hide or under report the really gross human
                    rights violations. We were very clear about the travesties and excesses of the
                    Iraqi regime. But the agreed upon approach was to try and moderate his behavior
                    by encouraging him to behave correctly. Obviously it didn't work. Had it worked,
                    we would have been hugely successful and we wouldn't have had the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Lets turn to the run up to the war with Kuwait, which started when the Iraqis
                    began beating the war drums against Israel. There was a lot of talk in March
                    April 1990. Saddam said in a speech that Iraq was prepared to set fire to half
                    of Israel and burn it to the ground. That raised a lot of alarm bells in
                    Washington as well as elsewhere. Nobody really quite understood what was causing
                    him to act this way. The United States at that point decided that it wanted to
                    calm down the rhetoric. It didn't want this escalating beyond control. We had
                    been through a number of exercises with the Iraqis including, as I mentioned
                    earlier, interdicting them from shipping frog surface to surface missiles to
                    downtown Beirut. The Iraqis were increasingly aggressive in the region and they
                    were being very bellicose in their rhetoric against Israel. They were beginning
                    to put soldiers on maneuvers in the south. The word that was that this was
                    preparatory to a sweep into Israel. That was apparently the word that Saddam was
                    giving to his soldiers; i.e. that they were exercising in anticipation of an
                    operation against Israel. On our recommendation, President Bush sent a
                    delegation of American Senators including Bob Dole, Frank Murkowski of Alaska,
                    McClure of Idaho, Metzenbaum of Ohio, and Allen Simpson of Wyoming. They came
                    out during their Easter break. They went to Egypt and other countries. They came
                    to Baghdad bearing a message to Saddam from the president which was, “Knock off
                    the rhetoric. Israel is not planning to do anything against you, and all you're
                    doing is escalating tensions in the region.” The message wasn't delivered very
                    well. They were very disappointed. I'll just cite you two examples. After Bob
                    Dole had gone through his piece, Saddam repliein which he said, “I didn't really
                    say I was going to set fire to half of Israel. What I said was that if they
                    attacked me, then I will set fire to half of Israel.” After his reply, Senator
                    Metzenbaum leaned forward in his chair and he said “Mr. President, I can tell
                    you're an honorable man.” I remember this very distinctly because I was the
                    notetaker at this meeting. Then Allen Simpson, who is about 6'7” or something
                    like that, leaned forward in one of these low chairwhen he leaned forward it
                    gave the impression he was getting on bended knee before this potentatsaid, “Mr.
                    President, I can see that what you have here isn't really a policy problem. What
                    you have is a public relations problem. You've got a problem with the press. I
                    know all about that, because I've got problems with the press back home. What
                    you need is you need a good press guy to insure that the message is as you want
                    it to be.” So you can imagine, Saddam is listening to these Senators say this,
                    “You're an honorable man,” and “Gee, you really don't have a policy problem.”
                    What he took away from that meeting was quite fair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point why was Saddam doing this? You said he'd
                        done it before. Was this just a general keeping his people on boil?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WILSON: A number of things were happening. Saddam at the end of the Iran Iraq War
                    did not demobilize; he was keeping his key troops under arms and he was keeping
                    another million as a home guard to basically guard the pipeline. That was 2
                    million men out of a population of 17 million. You can assume that another
                    million or so had either been killed or injured in the Iran Iraq War, so there
                    was a very high percentage of the population under arms or involved in national
                    defense, all of which is pretty costly. He was running a rearmament campaign on
                    a “guns and butter” budget. He was attempting to provide all the goods that his
                    country needed, and he was basically chronically short on cash and credit. He
                    had mortgaged the future of his country for several years forward. We all
                    realized that; so, I think in retrospect, that the rhetoric against Israel was
                    largely camouflage to what his real intentions were, which was to get the Arabs
                    to underwrite his “guns and butter budget.” In terms of the maneuvers, that was
                    also a deception: saying that they were maneuvering in anticipation of an
                    invasion of Israel was a deception because they were maneuvering in the south
                    obviously preparing for some sort of action on the Kuwaiti border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there any dissension in Iraq on this stance ? The
                        Israelis were not exactly a target that you wanted to overemphasize that you
                        were going to do something about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: But they were a natural target for the Iraqis because of the Israelis
                    attack on the Iraqi nuclear plant several years earlier. They were, in light of
                    their situation in the region, a natural external enemy in the absence of other
                    external enemies. I think the idea was to keep the tension level high in order
                    try to get other Arabs to underwrite the “gunand butter” budgekeep people
                    thinking about Iraq as a threat, so that there would be concessions made to it.
                    The Iraqis were hoping to keep people outside of the region thinking of it as a
                    threat to Israel in the hopes that they would react in a diplomatic way as
                    opposed to a military way. Of course, all the Arabs were telling us through all
                    this, “Don't do anything to provoke him, because all this is bluster.” This
                    became even more apparent when Saddam turned his sights on Kuwait. In the March
                    April time frame, there was a lot of movement of material to the south. The
                    Turks in particular, who had the best information in the country because they
                    had so many trading relationships, were beginning to sense that there would be
                    another war in the region and they were anticipating that it might be against
                    Kuwait. The IraqKuwait was relationships was beset by a number of issues:
                    forgiveness of Iraqi debt to Kuwait, increases in Kuwaiti aid to Iraq, Kuwaiti
                    adherence to the OPEC imposed quotas to maintain the price of petroleum at a
                    high leveallowing Iraq to realize more benefit from the export of its own
                    petroleum. Kuwait had stopped slant drilling in one of the southern oil fields
                    along the border between Kuwait and Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain why slant drilling was a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WILSON: They were drilling from Kuwait territory into oil that Iraq thought
                    belonged to iacross the border basically. Iraq was looking at its southern
                    frontier. It realized that it was going to be a long time, if ever, before it
                    could ever use Basra again as its principal outlet to the Gulf despite the fact
                    that it had built a huge port facility in a place called Um Kasr which was maybe
                    20 or 25 miles to the west of Basra situated on a very narrow part of the Gulf.
                    At the other side of this narrow strip of Iraq was Kuwaiti territory. At the
                    opening to the Gulf stood two islandBubiyan and Warba. The Iraqis wanted Kuwait
                    to give the Iraqis the right to garrison troops on that side of the outlet to
                    enhance their security of the port and access to the Gulf.</p>
                <p>This all came to a head in July when the Iraqis sent a delegation either Jeddah
                    or Riyadh to meet a Kuwaiti delegation to negotiate an agreement on all
                    outstanding issues. The Iraqis sent down Ali Hassan Al-Tikriti, who was known
                    for overseeing the gassing of the Kurds in the northe was called “the butcher of
                    Kurdistan.” Later he became known, when he was the temporary governor of the
                    19th Province, i.e., Kuwait, when it was annexed to Iraq, as “the butcher of
                    Kuwait.” What a terrible man. He was one of the members of the delegation. The
                    other members were Izzat Ibrahim, who was number two or number three in the
                    regime. He is kind of titular head, under Saddam, of the Baath Party apparatus.
                    They also sent Yassin Ramadan, who also was quite a thug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these all more or less from this one town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They've all were tied to Saddam from the very beginning. Ali Hassan
                    Al-Tikriti is from Tikrit. I am not sure where the others came from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still it was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: This was the “A” team. If the Kuwaitis had understood the situation
                    properly, they would have realized that the Iraqis were giving them an
                    ultimatum; they were not coming to negotiate. During this period we noticed
                    troop movements and the movement of tanks on rail cars to the south. Everybody
                    was getting very nervous. There was a lot of back and forth with Washington
                    about what actions we should take. The Arab League met in late July. Preparatory
                    to that meeting, Arab leaders told us not to do anything because they would
                    solve the problem; they insisted that Saddam was bluffing, and that if we made
                    any moves, we ran the risk of provoking Saddam into taking those actions which
                    we wanted to avoid. The Arab states wanted us to let them take the lead on
                    dealing with Saddam's activities.</p>
                <p>Q: Were relations such that you were meeting Iraqis to say, “Hey, you'd better
                    watch out,” or give them some warning?</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>WILSON: As I mentioned, we met with Saddam in April with when Dole and his
                    delegation came to Baghdad. Dole went in and delivered a message. We met with
                    Iraqi officials on a regular basis at the foreign ministry and particularly we'd
                    meet Nezar Hamdun, who was then the undersecretary. At all those meetings we
                    were basically briefed on the issues I just outlined and were told that the
                    Iraqis were going to continue negotiating.</p>
                <p>On July 25th or 26th, April Glaspie was scheduled to go talk to the foreign
                    minister. She went over to the foreign ministry, but was then put into a car and
                    taken over to the president's office to meet Saddam. During the course of that
                    meeting, Saddam said to her, “We will not take any action military so long as
                    there is a negotiation process ongoing.” Just before the meeting began, Saddam
                    was called out of his office to take a phone call from President Mubarak. He
                    took the phone call from Mubarak, and then came out and told ApriI wasn't there;
                    this is how it was reported back to mthat he had just told Mubarak that there
                    would be no military action as long as the diplomatic process was ongoing. That
                    was July 25th or 26th. As I said, all the Arabs were telling us this was a
                    bluff. Saddam had told both us and Mubarak on the same day at essentially the
                    same time that he wasn't going to take military action. The Arabs were telling
                    us not to do anything.</p>
                <p>We were getting nervous. We went cabled Washington to ask for another
                    presidential letter to Saddam requesting him to lower the tension level. During
                    the course of the meeting I just mentioned, of course, April Glaspie told Saddam
                    what American policy had been vis � vis the Arab borders since the beginning of
                    the division of the Arab region into the nation states; i.e. that the United
                    States doesn't take a position on the merits of a particular border dispute but
                    wants only that such disputes be resolved diplomatically or through
                    international arbitration. That had been the U.S. position; it had been the
                    Western position, and it had been most everybody's position since the beginning.
                    Glaspie has often been criticized afterwards for not having given Saddam the
                    “stop sign.” The Iraqis, in the person of Tariq Aziz, would tell you, and have
                    done so publicly, that they didn't call April Glaspie in to ask for a green,
                    yellow or red light; they were not looking for that and that they understood
                    perfectly what she was saying because that had been American policy. They took
                    their decision based upon the failure of negotiations and not on the U.S.
                    position. At the same time, we received President Bush's letter to give to
                    Saddam which she delivered. The next day or a couple of days later, John Kelly,
                    the assistant secretary of State for the Near East, appears before the House
                    International Relations Committee. I think it was the whole Committenot a
                    subcommittebecause the session was chaired by Lee Hamiltoand it was a public
                    session. During the course of the that session Lee Hamilton asked a question to
                    which he obviously already knew the answeor he could have found the answer by
                    asking the Congressional Research Service. The question was: “Do we have a
                    mutual defense pact with Kuwait that would obligate us to come to their defense
                    in the event they were invaded by Iraq?” John Kelly gave the correct answer,
                    which was: “No, we don't.”</p>

                <p>WILSON: I doubt that that was his intent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the wrong question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was the wrong question to ask in public session, very clearly. For
                    those who point fingers at who lost Kuwait, to me that was the defining moment
                    because the U.S. Congress forced the U.S. Executive Branch to say that we have
                    no legal obligation to come to the defense of Kuwait in the event of an invasion
                    by Iraq. That was far more than anything that April Glaspie might said in her
                    meeting with Saddam Hussein. As I have told people in the Bush I administration
                    later, “What would you have had her say? We're going to bring the B52s over and
                    bomb you back to the stone age if you invade Kuwait.” That clearly would have
                    exceeded her instructions if she had gone any further than she actually
                    went.</p>
                <p>Then Kelly testifies. His testimony goes all over the world at sort of lickety
                    split speed. April by this time has left Baghdad. She left the day after she met
                    with Saddam on a long planned leave which included home leave, medical leave for
                    both her and her aged mother who was living with her at the time as well as
                    consultations in Washington. This was consistent with what other diplomatic
                    missions were doing. Most ambassadors were out of town during the months of July
                    and August, and indeed at the time of the invasion of Kuwait almost all of them
                    were out of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any discussion about whether this was a good
                        time to leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Certainly, yes. There was a lot of discussion; there was lots of back and
                    forth between the embassy and the State Department. At the end this assessment,
                    everybody was convinced that Saddam was bluffing and therefore April should do
                    what she had to planned to do, which included consultations in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were essentially an “African hand.” This was what you
                        had been doing. Did you feel yourself trying to figure out what the Arab
                        mind was and what they might be thinking? Did you kind of wonder what were
                        these people thinking about, or did our Arab experts give you getting a
                        pretty good reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>WILSON: First of all, the Iraqi is not like any other Arab. He is not Levantine
                    and he is not Gulf dweller. The Turks in one of their old dictionaries used to
                    define arrogance as in to 'walk like a Baghdadi.' They are very direct. They are
                    not circumspect in the same way that Gulf Arabs are, nor are they deceptively
                    friendly as the Levantines are. Secondly, by this time, I had already been
                    dealing with the Iraqis for a couple years on issues ranging from the Iran Iraq
                    War to Arab Israelis issues to their activities in Lebanon. We had had some
                    considerable success in stopping the shipment of the “frogs” to downtown
                    Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Frogs” being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Being the surface to surface missiles that they hoped the Lebanese would
                    use to inflict some damage on Syria by using Beirut as the battleground. So in
                    some respects, the Iraqis were in this odd, tacit alliance with Israel. They
                    were both supporting a Christian faction which was hunkered down in downtown
                    Beirut, against the various forces. Aoun, being a Mennonite Christian, was
                    fighting against the Syrian forces and the various other Lebanese groups. They
                    were involved in the latter phases of the Lebanese civil war. The Iraqis wanted
                    to seize this opportunity to ship some from surface to surface missiles that
                    then could be used to attack Syrian interests in Beirut. We stopped that, and by
                    stopping that we allowed the Lebanese presidential succession to go forward.
                    Unfortunately, the President Mowad was blown up in a car bomb during his
                    inaugural parade.</p>
                <p>To answer your previous question, I felt that, while understanding the Iraqis was
                    a huge problem, it was not one where I felt disadvantaged because I hadn't spent
                    20 years in the Arab world. It was one where we all were at a relative
                    disadvantage because nobody had been down this road before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the other Arabs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>WILSON: The Iraqis had been through their war with Iran, and so the Iraqis had an
                    advantage; they knew exactly where they were goinat least Saddam did. So I
                    didn't feel terribly disadvantaged in this. At the end of the day, I actually
                    think the African experience held me in better stead than most other if, by
                    comparison, one looked at some of my European colleagues or at some of my
                    colleagues who had spent most of their careers in Europe. The reason is that in
                    Africa, as in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, relationships are largely
                    personal. European and American relationships are largely bureaucratic and
                    institutional. So if you've accustomed to managing aspects of an institutional
                    relationship, the experience that you bring to an intensely personal type
                    negotiation are far different from those that would come from having worked in a
                    series of countries where the personal relationships were really very important.
                    I had already worked on pretty significant issues, in Central Africi.e. the
                    Angolan peace process which was diplomacy at the highest level, with presidents
                    of various countries on a regular basis. I think that that particular experience
                    actually served me well in Iraq and more than made up for the relative lack of
                    experience in the Arab world. Again, by the time of the Gulf War, I had spent
                    two years in the Arab world working with one of our most highly respected
                    ArabistApril Glaspie</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other question: Somehow or another there was talk
                        about us having an air refueling exercise. Could you mention what that
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. At the time that John Kelly testified, the decision was finally
                    made that we needed to do something to “show the flag” in the regiowe needed to
                    express our concerns in a way that went beyond the Glaspie meeting with Saddam
                    Hussein. So the decision was made with the Bahrainians to conduct a refueling
                    exercise. We launched into the air a couple of our tankers in the region and we
                    flew them around the Gulf off the coast of Bahrain to refuel aircraft for a
                    couple days. That was a widely publicized joint military exercise that we were
                    undertaking with the Bahrainian armed forces designed really to signal that we
                    were present in the Gulf and that we were concerned. At the same time, it was
                    designed not to be provocative in the sense that we were not seen to be moving
                    troops into the region in anticipation of an Iraqi move.</p>
                <p>Q: At this point were you talking to Chas Freeman or was there any talk,
                    particularly with the Saudis, about problems?</p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. Chas will have his own take on this because he was in Riyadh
                    talking to the Saudis. We were pretty busy just dealing with the Iraqis, but
                    clearly all the Arabs, all the key Arab leaders, were indicating to us through
                    every channel available that we should do nothing provocative. That message was
                    coming through loud and clear.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I think the lesson in that should not be lost on anybody. Fundamentally in a
                    situation like that, you're put in a position where a non Iraqi state would have
                    to absorb the first blow. Somebody has to absorb the first blow before we could
                    react. As I have said, the advice from other Arab and other states was that
                    Saddam was bluffing; our own intelligence assessments up until about 18 hours
                    before the actual invasion of Kuwait, were inconclusive. We saw the massing of
                    the troops; we saw the logistical support moving south; we saw the establishment
                    of supply lines, etc., but none of the various indicators that would lead an
                    analyst to determine conclusively that the Iraqis were going to invade Kuwait
                    turned positive until very shortly before the invasioso shortly, in fact, that
                    it was really only a matter of hours before information that caused the analysts
                    to reach the conclusion that Iraqis were going to invade became known to policy
                    makers like Bob Kimmit and people in the office of the undersecretary for
                    political affairs.</p>
                <p>Now, the night before the invasion, which would have been the night of August 1st
                    or August 2nd, I was having dinner with an Arab who served as Saddam's principal
                    arms purchaser in Paris. He was the one who arranged all the purchase of French
                    arms that the Iraqis had bought including, I'm sure, the missile system used to
                    hit a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Stark, several years earlier before during the
                    Iran Iraq War.</p>
                <p>This dinner was a significant event, so I will describe it to you. It took place
                    in the middle of the Arabian summeit must have been 120 degrees outsidlate in an
                    afternoo5:30 or six o'clock. When we walked into his houswhich felt freezing to
                    45/50 degrees. It probably was warmer than that. It was probably 65% or 70%, but
                    it was about cool as you could possibly get a house in that time of day. Our
                    host had a fireplace in the house which had roaring fire blazing in it. There
                    was a white baby grand piano in the corner, sheer white, and somebody was
                    playing classical music on it. At the dinner there was just my wife and myself
                    and our host and his wife and his four bodyguards. The dinner went from about
                    six o'clock to when we finally got up from the tablprobably about 9:30 p.m or 10
                    p.m o'clock. It was a classic Arab meal during which you end up eating forever
                    and then, as soon as the meal is over, you get up and leave, if you can still
                    walk. During the course of the evening, we discussed virtually every problem on
                    the global scene. It was one of the those wide ranging discussions. We touched
                    on the Arab world, we touched on the Baath Party, we touched on alliances, we
                    touched on Arab relations with the West, we did Arab Israeli affairs. The only
                    issue we didn't touch was Kuwait. At this time down in Tayib the negotiations
                    had already broken down and the Iraqi team had returned.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>WILSON: In Saudi Arabia, where the negotiations had taken place. We left about
                    and got home and went to bed. At about 2:30 a.m. the phone rings. My house was
                    not chilled to 55 degrees, so generally I slept naked. I jump out of bethe
                    phone's on the other side of the roostumble across the room, trip over my dog
                    who was sleeping at the foot of the bed. The dog starts barking, I'm grappling
                    for the phone. I finally picked up the phone, and listened to the voice on the
                    other enone of the security guards at the embasssaying: “Sir, I have the White
                    House on the line.” I was at that time the charge'Glaspie having left for leave.
                    My immediate reaction was, “My God, the president of the United States is
                    calling.” I did what any patriotic American would do. I stood at attention and
                    saluted and waited for the president, my president, to come on the phone. You
                    can just have the image of me standing stark naked at 2:30 in the morning
                    saluting this phone, while my dog was barking in the background, waiting for the
                    president of the United States to come on the line; it is a picture that I will
                    not soon forget. Then, of course, the line went dead and nobody came on. By that
                    time I had kind of gathered my wits about me and I realized that, one, it
                    probably wasn't really the president of the United States calling me and, two, I
                    wasn't going to call the White House in the absence of knowing precisely who had
                    called. I called the National Security Council staffer, Sandy Charles; she told
                    me that the Iraqis had just invaded Kuwait and that our ambassador in Kuwait
                    City was reporting that there was gunfire there and that they were seeing troops
                    which, in fact, had circled the embassy. So I said, “Fine.” I called Nat down in
                    Kuwait, got him on the phone, and we had just started chatting when they cut the
                    lines.</p>
                <p>After that point I could not get an international line to call out. The Iraqis,
                    who were very good at this and had done this during the Iran Iraq War, had
                    basically unplugged one of the most modern telecommunications systems at the
                    time and forced all people then to go through operators to get international
                    calls. I took a shower and got dressed, and went to the office. By about 7:30 or
                    eight o'clock in the morning, I was over at the foreign ministry with Tariq Aziz
                    as soon as he got in. I had no instructions at that time; I was relying
                    principally on what I assumed the American message in this instance would
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>WILSON: The message to Iraq was that, “What you have done is inconsistent with
                    commitments that your president made to April Glaspie. It's inconsistent with
                    the Charter of the United Nations; it's inconsistent with the Arab League
                    Charter, and it's inconsistent with the draft Iraqi Constitution, all of which
                    said in one degree or another that “thou shall not invade thy neighbor to
                    resolve border disputes.” Tariq, who for perhaps the only time during the whole
                    time I knew him, was less than fully eloquent; he seemed a bit confused and
                    appeared to me to be improvising He replied that Saddam's commitment to April
                    Glaspie was that the Iraqis would not take military action so long as there was
                    a negotiating process ongoing, and that, since, the negotiations had failed in
                    Tayib, the military option was open to the Iraqis. I replied to Tariq that he
                    knew better than I that one failed negotiating session does not a failed process
                    make. He knew that very well because there had been in a series of failed
                    negotiating sessions since the conclusion of the Iran Iraq War and the
                    implementation of Security Council Resolution 598, which was the governing
                    resolution to bring about the cease fire in the Iran Iraq War. They should not
                    have concluded from a failed session in Tayib that the process itself had
                    failed. Then I said to him that, insofar as we now had Iraqi troops surrounding
                    our embassy in Kuwait City and throughout Kuwait and we had the U.S. Navy, which
                    was still patrolling the Persian Gulf guaranteeing some sort of security in the
                    Gulf for tankers navigating those waters, that it behooved us both to insure
                    that we did everything in our power to minimize the potential for accidents
                    between our forces in the region. I suggested that one of the ways we could do
                    that would be to have direct contact between our respective embassies and our
                    respective capitals. I asked him to restore my direct line from the embassy
                    compound to Washington. Much to surprise, in about three hours they had done it.
                    In life one takes the minor victories when one can get them. So within three
                    hours we had our telephones up and running again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Thing were happening very fasso fast that when I went to see Tariq, it
                    was before I had received any instructions from Washington. When I went to see
                    Tariq about eight o'clock in the morning, it would have been about midnight
                    Washington time. When the Iraqis invaded Kuwait and I heard about it, it was
                    about two o'clock in the morning, which would have been about six, I guess, in
                    the evening Washington timeight hours earlier. So very little time had passed.
                    We were able to test our satellite phone. We had a radio telephone that allowed
                    us to communicate, but had to go to the communications center and they were to
                    go up to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of brand new technology, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WILSON: Actually this was old technology. This was before the satellite phone
                    that we see now. This was a radio phonessentially a ham radio type operation. We
                    also had our communications hook up for cable traffic. This was before the age
                    of e mail. I was flying pretty much on my own when I went to see Tariq. I came
                    back and reported that conversation. We then got the telephone connection re
                    established tying us in on a 24 hour a day department's operations center, which
                    housed an emergency task force on the Middle East crisis.</p>
                <p>In the first hours after the invasion, the president, as one of his first
                    decisions, issued an executive order basically stopping all commercial trade and
                    imposing sanctions on all transactions between Iraq and the United States. In
                    order to get a waiver from these sanctions, one had to go to the Office of
                    Foreign Asset Control, an office that is part of the Treasury Department. That
                    resulted for example in every time there was a shift change aAT&amp;and to a
                    certain extent I have to imagine this, because I was sitting out in Baghdaour
                    telephone connection with the Department of State would go down. That mean that
                    every eight hourthe length of the shifwe would have to send off a flurry of
                    cables asking for these telephone lines the be reinstituted. After a couple
                    hours the lines would come back up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an American company responding the presidential
                        mandate by cutting its service off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: This was an American company. My sense of how this would have happened,
                    if you want to try and visualize the process, you would have a shift change,
                    which meant that a new person would come in to control commercial transactions;
                    he or she would look at the clipboard and notice that the line between Iraq and
                    Washington was operational. As he or she understood the executive order, that
                    was prohibited and so they would then instruct that the line be cut. It took
                    three days to sort this out. The Department of State then had to go to the
                    Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control, to get a waiver which
                    could be taken to AT&amp;T which finally allowed the line to be re established
                    and not be cut every time there was a shift change. That was one of the little
                    hiccups early on with which we had to deal.</p>
                <p>The other thinand I think that this sort of set the tone for our relationship
                    with Washingtowas that we understood from early on was that if we didn't control
                    the action in Baghdad, Washington would control it from Washington. We did
                    everything we could do to be proactive. For example, I went to see Tariq Aziz
                    and I laid a lot of our concerns. After that we sent in a number of
                    recommendations and took a number of security related actions. We painted the
                    windows white; we enhanced our security; we moved people into various compounds
                    so that they weren't spread all over the citthings like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when I was in Saudi Arabia in 1958, an Iraqi
                        mob had almost literally torn a few innocent Americans apart. Was that sort

                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>WILSON: We got to that point but not quite then. We were initially doing
                    everything that we could to get everybody together in the event that we had to
                    evacuate. We hadn't scoped out the mob scenario just yet because we didn't have
                    timwe didn't have the luxury of sitting down and doing that, although we did
                    that on the third day, and I'll get to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing: When you were talking to Tariq Aziz, was
                        there still a doubt in your mind of what the Iraqis were after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. In the early days there was a sense that the Iraqis were intent on
                    punishing Kuwait and to take what they needed from Kuwait, after which we
                    thought that they would probably withdraw. The evolution of the 19th Province
                    strategy and the transferring of the border to the hills just north of Kuwait
                    didn't occur until the ensuing days. We're talking about August 2nd now, and all
                    that didn't really come to pass until August 6th.</p>
                <p>In addition to enhancing our security posture, we did the” burn down” we burned
                    down to about five minutes. We did everything we could. We had a number of
                    Americans who were hiding in Kuwait. There was a little 13 year old girl who had
                    been on an airplane that had been stuck in the Kuwait City airport at the time
                    of the invasion and was captured by the Iraqis. She was traveling alone going
                    from father or mother to father or mother in India from San Francisco. We were
                    trying to account for all the missing American citizens. We were trying to find
                    her particularly because she had disappeared somewhere in the midst of all this.
                    We were trying to locate Americans everywhere; we did a very comprehensive early
                    report on steps that we had taken and what we intended to do, and we sent that
                    back to Washington the first day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't mean to over interrupt, but I think in your desire
                        to be pro activahead of the gamWashington will generally agree with you.
                        Otherwise the concern is that Washington might be telling you things to do
                        which might not make sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's absolute right. If you have the pen in hand and you draft what you
                    think is the right thing to do, Washington will essentially edit from your piece
                    of paper. They will sing from your music or they will change your music, but
                    essentially it's your music that they're playing.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, and this became very clear in the first National Security
                    Council meeting. I was told that by John Kelly, who was then the assistant
                    secretary of State for NEA. The first National Security CounciSecretaries of
                    State, Defense, Treasury, CIA director and a few othermeeting was chaired by
                    President Bush himself. Kelly was there. Kelly said that in this first meeting
                    the president was kind of brainstorming with the principals. The president was
                    sitting up there being presidential and ruminating about what to do. He has made
                    his line in the sand argumenI guess it was 'line in the sand' or 'this will not
                    stand,' whatever it waand somebody leans forwarKelly claims it was him and it
                    probably waand says to the president of the United States, “Mr. President, if
                    you look at your executive summary here, you'll see that a lot of these things
                    you're suggesting we do Joe Wilson has already done. It's right there in front
                    of you.” And that, according to Kelly, gave me enormous credibility, and gave
                    the embassy enormous credibility in Washington as a functioning operation which
                    could be counted on. That made us sort of insiders for all of what went on
                    afterwards. I was told by David Welch, who is soon to be our ambassador to Egypt
                    but was at the time on the National Security Council staff in charge of Near
                    Eastern and South Asian affairs, that in subsequent meetings, the next three or
                    four meetings while they were still doing the planning and thinking about next
                    steps, every time somebody would come up with an idea, President Bush would say,
                    “What does Joe Wilson think about this?” Now, that's a two edged sword. In
                    Washington nobody really cares what they think about in the field, and to be
                    reminded by the president every time someone comes up with an idea it has to be
                    run it by Joe Wilson, is not something that appeals to a lot of power players in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>That gets us up to the first days of the invasion. As I said, early on we
                    actually were able to move people into a few locations. We were able to make
                    plans for evacuation and drawdown of American citizens. We found the little 13
                    year old girl and were able to get her evacuated in the first group.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you do that? You went to the Iraqis...</p>
                <p>WILSON: I went to the Iraqis and said, “You just have to give her to us,” and
                    they did. The Iraqis had closed all borders. We made our plans to evacuate
                    people by land to Jordan; that required us give the Iraqis ten days' advance
                    notice, which was what we normally had to do anyway to get permission to move
                    outside of a 25 mile area around Baghdad. In the midst of all this, one of my
                    communicators died of a brain hemorrhage. He was a TCU [Technical Communications
                    unit]. He was a guy who was very, very popular in the community. So at a time
                    when everybody's emotions were running very high anyway, somebody who had meant
                    a lot to many people in the embassy died of a brain hemorrhage, and we couldn't
                    get the body out.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>We were able to get the body moved over to a storage area. It wasn't a morgue
                    because in the Arab world you bury the dead within 24 hours and you don't
                    embalm. They don't have the same sort of facilities that we have in our
                    worlfundamentally it was an ice chest in some downtown establishment. I went
                    over and checked the body. We made arrangements to keep it housed there. We got
                    everything ready to put it in a coffin that met international standards, which
                    is something that I've always insisted at every embassy I've gone ti.e. that
                    there be the necessary equipment to use when an American dies overseas, because
                    I had spent most of my career in Third World countries and at every one of my
                    posts somebody has died. You have to have body bags; you have to have
                    internationally approved coffins so that you can ship the bodies home and stuff
                    like that. We had done that, so we were prepared for this eventuality. But there
                    were no planes flying in and out.</p>
                <p>At the same time we also had an American who had been picked up by the Iraqis. He
                    had also died of a heart attack. Those were our only two casualties during the
                    whole crisis. We had these two bodies and we were able to make arrangements for
                    them to be transported out of the country. I can't remember exactly what we did.
                    It must have been a flight. Either we chartered a flight or there was a flight
                    going to Jordan or something. But in the midst of all this, we had to come to
                    grips with the community's grief. There was no English speaking priest in
                    Baghdad. There was an Anglican Church, and the person who ran it was sort of a
                    lay pastor; he was a wonderful. I contacted him, and we brought him over to the
                    embassy, and we invited everybody for a memorial service in our courtyard. We
                    had a memorial service and the pastor struck just the right tone. We took a half
                    hour; we got all our nationals and we got all the Americans who wanted to come,
                    and I said a few words and then turned it over to the pastor who conducted a
                    service. We all took a half hour to grieve our colleague who had passed away and
                    then went back to work.</p>
                <p>At this time we were working literally 20/22 hours a day trying to get all our
                    plans ready and to contact everyone. Every night I was getting calls at one
                    o'clock in the morning saying that Nat Howell had just reported to the
                    Department of State that Iraqi troops had amassed around the embassy compound
                    and that they were in a formation that suggested that they were going to come
                    over the walls and take the embassy. I would go over to the foreign ministry,
                    flag flying on my car, go in the back door, go see Nezar Hamdun and report this
                    to him and tell him, “Don't do it.” A couple of hours later I'd get a call at
                    home waking me up, and it would be Nezar telling me that a higher authority had
                    just told hithat higher authority being Saddathat I should not worry; they
                    weren't going to invade. I would relay that back to Washington, and an hour
                    later or so Washington would report back to me that in fact the Iraqi troops had
                    backed off from the embassy compound. This went on every night for several
                    nights. We were not getting any sleep.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>We had all our dependents still in Baghdad, so that we were having to deal with a
                    lot the family issues. We had people stuck Kuwait, and it was pretty hectic.
                    Iraqi courts were rounding up American citizens and making them hostages. On the
                    fourth of August, I guess it was, they brought up a bunch of Americans out of
                    Kuwaithey had been captured there during the invasion; they put them in one of
                    the hotels in Baghdad. I went over to try to see them. They wouldn't let me see
                    any of them. I was prepared to call a hostage a hostage and I called Washington.
                    By that time we also had a few of the press people coming in. I called
                    Washington and talked to Bob Kimmit about it. Kimmit was very reluctant at the
                    time to...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was the undersecretary for political affairs at the time. He was
                    reluctanand I think that he reflected accurately the administration's positioto
                    refer to them as hostages until the situation became clearer. I think there was
                    a sense that, if we started referring to them as hostages, Saddam might get the
                    idea that he ought to really take them hostage; on the other hand, the situation
                    was still in such a state of flux that perhaps they would released at an
                    appropriate time. The only one they did release was the young girl. Most of the
                    rest of them were roughnecks. They were guys who worked for a Santa Fe oil
                    company and a couple of the other oil companies who were working in the Kuwait
                    oil fields. Then there were some Americans that they had pulled in off the
                    streets and some that they had gotten off of airplanes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's exactly right. In fact, we had always used the number 2,000 as an
                    estimate of how many Americans were in Kuwait; it turned out to be far
                    fewer.</p>
                <p>It is now about the fifth of August. We've had a lot of back and forth with
                    Washington. The phone service had been restored. Dan Rather came into town. So
                    did Ted Koppel and Forrest Sawyer.</p>
                <p>Q: You might explain who they were.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>WILSON: Forrest Sawyer was a correspondent with CBS. Ted Koppel was the host
                    oABC's “Nightline” and one of their key newsman. Dan Rather at that time was the
                    anchor for the CBS “Evening News.” Forrest Sawyer was in first in, followed by
                    Koppel, followed by Rather. When the first one came in, we put them up in our
                    executive suitan office that was often empty. When we were inundated by the
                    press corps, they all came to us and said, “We need to file our stories, and we
                    can't file from any of the hotels because you can't get a direct line.” Even
                    then the technology was such that you could file directly from your computer
                    through a telephone line to your home office if you could get a direct line. We
                    were the only ones who had a direct line. So we converted our USIS Cultural
                    Center into a press office and allowed the American press in particular but the
                    international press also to set up shop there to file from there. We tried to
                    set up a way to account for it, although I don't think that was ever run
                    terribly well. It was important to us, we thought, that the story be covered
                    fully from Iraq from the beginning. The more information that got out from
                    Baghdad, the better off we all were, and as a consequence, I made myself
                    available to the press on a regular basis. As I said, we housed the press
                    initially in our executive office. After a few days, we decided that perhaps it
                    was not so smart to have them quite that close where they could observe all of
                    our inner workings.</p>
                <p>The next big day in all of this was August 6th. When I arrived at the office, I
                    was told to be at the foreign ministry at 10 o'clock or 10:30. I went with my
                    political officer, Nancy Johnson. We went to Tariq Aziz's office and, lo and
                    behold, were told that we would meet Saddam. As I may have mentioned earlier,
                    Saddam never met chiefs of mission alone. He would meet them in the context of
                    the foreign representative escorting an exalted political visitor, but he would
                    not meet to discuss substance. He would not meet them to receive their
                    credentials. Those chores were all delegated. So for him to have met with April
                    Glaspie on the 25th or 26th of July and me on the sixth of August was
                    unprecedented.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I conclude that the reason he gave the United States so much
                    personal attention was because in his own calculations he did not fear not an
                    international reaction to the Kuwait invasion, but he did fear a unilateral
                    American reaction; he feared that the United States might react unilaterally.
                    That was quite clear from my meeting with him that day. The meeting was attended
                    by Nancy and myself, and Saddam, his translator, Zuveral Zubeti, Nezar Hamdun,
                    Tariq Aziz, and a few others. We saw Mouza Houwi, who was the other under
                    secretary for political affairs, and Ryad Al Casey, who was their chief lawyer
                    twice and he actually may be at the United Nations. It was really the A team of
                    the Iraqi foreign ministra very intelligent, bright bunch of fellows, very
                    experienced, very tough. We walk in and Saddam's standing there and the cameras
                    are going and he's wearing his gun. I walk up to him and we shake hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>There were a couple things that I had learned over the years on how to deal with
                    Saddam and I had seen some of the things come out since the invasion of Kuwait.
                    One, it was clear to me that I was not going to be caught on camera smiling. If
                    you look at the trailers and the clips that show of April Glaspie at the time of
                    the invasion, they show her shaking hands with Saddam and smiling as if they
                    were sharing a joke. That was not going to happen to mTwo, in all the pictures
                    showing Saddam greeting people, the people would be caught on camera sort of
                    bowing to Saddam. I had noticed this when I first got there. My first meeting
                    with Saddam, as I mentioned, was when I escorted Arlen Specter and Dick Shelby.
                    Arlen Specter was the senior senator from Pennsylvania, and Dick Shelby was the
                    senator from Alabama. At that time he was a Democrat. I had noticed the
                    phenomenon of people bowing to Saddam Hussein. This was about the time that
                    Nancy Reagan had gotten in a lot of trouble when she'd gone to England and had
                    been caught curtseying to the Queen of England. The American press corps had
                    reacted in horror; after all we had fought a war 200 and some odd years ago
                    against the monarchy to be republicans and here we were still curtseying to the
                    Queen of England. I figured that if you can't curtsey to the Queen of England,
                    you sure as hell shouldn't be bowing to this potentate in Iraq. I'd gone to the
                    meeting with Shelby and Specter; afterwards I went home and turned on the TV and
                    watched it and, of course, there we were. The opening news item was Shelby,
                    Specter and Joe Wilson going up to shake hands with Saddam Hussein, and there's
                    Joe Wilson bowing to Saddam Hussein. I said, “I can't quite figure that out.”
                    After a while of watching that tape, I figured that Saddam used a number of
                    psychological tricks. For one, he broke that social space with the visitor, so
                    that he actually got closer to you before shaking your hands; the handshake was
                    the last of the introduction rituals. First, you stood face to face, and he
                    stared at you unblinkingly with these very deep brown eyes; he might engage in
                    some idle chit chat, “How's the day?” “What's the news?”the sort of stuff that
                    one says when one greets somebody. Then after an appropriate amount of timwhile
                    the chit chat was being translated by the translatohe stuck out his hand, but he
                    didn't stick his hand out at a normal level. He stuck his hand out very low,
                    about crotch level for want of a description; so if you were standing staring at
                    him from a distance of about 12 inches and the time came to shake hands, his
                    hand was real low, forcing you to look down to make sure that you grabbed his
                    hand and not another piece of his anatomy. And that's when the camera caught you
                    bowing to him. When I saw him, on August 6th, the time came to shake hands; I
                    was prepared and I actually did just reach out and grab. That I'm here to tell
                    you the story will suggest to you that I did get his hand and not that other
                    part of the anatomy.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>When I came back, I told that story to Tom Foley, who then was the Speaker of the
                    House but who, as I said earlier, had been my boss when I was a Congressional
                    Fellow and he was Majority Whip. I'm sitting in the Speaker's office in the
                    Capitol building, which is quite an ornate office right in the heart of the
                    Capitol, and Tom and Heather, his wife, were sitting there. I told the story,
                    and Tom leans forward in his chaihe's got this big overstuffed Speaker's chaiand
                    he says to me, “You mean to tell me that you were this close to having Saddam
                    Hussein by the short hairs and you didn't go for it, and as a consequence we had
                    to send Norm Schwarzkopf and 500,000 of America's finest to finish the job?” He
                    also served at the time as head of the PIFIAthe presidential intelligence
                    oversight board. He called me a couple days later and said, “You know, I have to
                    tell you that I couldn't resist, even though you told me that story in the
                    confines of our office, opening up the meeting of the president's intelligence
                    oversight board today by telling that story. Now everybody in Washington knows.
                    It'll be all around Washington by the time you sit down to dinner tonight.”</p>
                <p>Back to the meeting. Saddam and I sat down. He was still wearing his gun, and the
                    cameras were still on as we're sitting there. I'll show you the picture
                    afterwards. I still have the picture in my offica souvenir from the time when I
                    did serious diplomacy for a living. Saddam says, “Well, what's the news?” By
                    this time, we're four days into the crisis. I'm angry. I haven't slept a wink.
                    I've got people who are being held hostage in Iraq and in Kuwait. I've got an
                    ambassador down in Kuwait who calls me every night saying he's about to be
                    overrun. I'm not a happy camper. So I figure I'll make a little joke here. I
                    tell Saddam, “Look, if you want to know what's new, you really ought to address
                    that question to your foreign minister and not me, because your foreign minister
                    has a satellite dish which allows him to get American news stations such as CNN.
                    I've been fighting with him for two years now to try to get a satellite dish for
                    our embassy. I can't get one for our embassy. So if you want to know what's new,
                    ask him. Don't ask me.” Saddam laughed at that. I said it in a sort of jocular
                    way. Saddam laughs, and I, as one who always likes to laugh at his own jokes,
                    sat back up and started to smile to share the laugh with him. Then I remembered
                    that the cameras were still there. I just stopped right in mid smile and leaned
                    back forward as stern as I could be, which was a good move because you never see
                    me on American television smiling to Saddam Hussein. You never see April Glaspie
                    not smiling to Saddam Hussein. If there was one mistake that was madand of
                    course it wasn't really a mistake because Saddam hadn't invaded Kuwait at the
                    time, and it was normal to smile with a chief of state if you were in a meeting
                    with hiit was to have the image of April Glaspie smiling in the American psyche.
                    We spent almost two hours together, listening mostly to Saddam telling me the
                    history of the demarcation of Arab borders and why the Al Sabah family was
                    'history'and this was his term.</p>

                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>WILSON: Being the rulers of Kuwait. I remember distinctly this was the one time
                    when Tariq Aziz got into the conversation. Mostly it was Saddam speaking through
                    his translator to me and then me back to Saddam; the first 45 minutes to an hour
                    were a Saddam monologue. At one point he said, “Whatever we decide to do with
                    Kuwait, the one thing you need to understand is that the Al Sabah family is
                    history.” The translator had trouble translating that, and so Tariq Aziz jumped
                    in and said, “The Al Sabah family is history.” That for me was a very
                    interesting phrase because at that time, when you said somebody is history, that
                    was American slang. It was very popular to say that somebody is historas
                    i“You're history, man.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means you're finished.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Which means you're finished. One didn't heard that often in formal
                    conversation; so for them, Tariq in particular, to have this much knowledge of
                    not just the English language but American slang English really struck me. The
                    crux of the Iraqi position was: “We keep Kuwait; you let us keep Kuwait; don't
                    react, and we will become the guarantors for the Persian Gulf”much the same role
                    that had been attributed to the Iranians under the Sha“and we will guarantee you
                    a steady supply of petroleum at a reasonable price. We will not do anything
                    against Saudi Arabia unless the Saudi rulers allow their country to be used as a
                    platform from which efforts to destabilize my regime, the Iraqi regime, are
                    launched.” That was the crux of the deal. I had no talking points, since the
                    meeting had been set up on such short notice. So I had nothing to give back to
                    him. I essentially took the same line that I had used with Tariq. I mentioned
                    the instability in world oil markets that this invasion had caused. Saddam
                    interrupted me to digress for 20 minutes on oil prices. Then I got back to the
                    points that I had thought of raising with him, which were the three that I had
                    raised with Tariq Aziz: “It's inconsistent with the Arab League; it's
                    inconsistent with your draft Constitution; and it's inconsistent with the United
                    Nations for you to be invading a neighbor; in addition to that, there are three
                    specific issues. One, you've got to quit looting American diplomatic properties.
                    Two, you've got to open the border so that Americans and other foreigners can
                    leave.” The third point must have been something on human rights. When I said,
                    “You ought to open your border so that Americans can leave consistent with the
                    Geneva and Vienna Conventions,” he said, “Are you talking about just Americans?”
                    and I said, “Well, I'm only empowered to speak on behalf of Americans, but I
                    would think that more broadly you ought to open your border so that all
                    foreigners can leave.” At that point he said, “Why? Do you know something that I
                    don't know about a potential American response?” I said, “Well, Mr. President, I
                    can assure you that if I knew something about American intentions, I would not
                    share it with you, but what I will tell you is that I intend to be here so long
                    as there is a role for diplomats to play in resolving this peacefully.”</p>

                        realized that we just could not let this guy sit on all that oil. This is
                        not something that really can...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was not the Gambian peanut crop we're talking about. Two things were
                    clear to me pretty much from the very beginning: one, that we were not going to
                    allow this to stand; and, two, that if we were going to get Iraq out, we had to
                    do it by being very bellicose. Either we were going to have to go to war or our
                    threats of going to war had to be very credible. That was clear to me, and I
                    told that to President Bush. When I went to the Oval Office to meet him, the
                    first thing I said to the president was just that. We hadn't spoken directly
                    during the early August days, but we'd had some telegraphic exchanges;
                    nevertheless I felt from the very beginning that we were on the same wave length
                    on this issue. In any case, President Bush said, “You're absolutely right,” and
                    then he turned and introduced me to everybody else.</p>
                <p>In this meeting on August 6th Saddam laid out the deal. I laid out our concerns.
                    He asked me if I knew something about U.S. intentions. I told him if I did, I
                    wouldn't share it with him anyway but I intended to be in Baghdad as long as
                    there was any diplomacy to be conducted. It was a tough meeting. I gave as good
                    as I got. About halfway through the meetinjust another little atmospheriSaddam
                    goes for his gun, and I'm going, “Hmmmm. Was it something I said? Did I forget
                    to brush my teeth this morning or what?” But he really was just going for his
                    gun belt because he wanted to take it off. He said, “It is really uncomfortable
                    with my bad back and everything, to wear this gun sitting in this seat.” So
                    after the cameras were gone, he took off the gun and put it on the table. After
                    the meeting's over, we're walking out shaking hands with everybody. Saddam, as
                    we're walking out, put his arm on my shoulder and said, “That was a good
                    meeting.” I'm thinking to myself,” hmmm, if it was a good meeting for him,
                    shit.” I think I had been plenty tough with him. I went back to the office and
                    we did three cables. My political note taker wrote the...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>WILSON: Nancy Johnson wrote the formal memorandum of conversation. I wrote a real
                    quick and dirty “This is the deal” cable. Then I wrote a shorter version of the
                    memorandum of conversation basically encapsulating the main points and some of
                    my thoughts about it. About at the time that I returned to the office, which
                    would have been about 12:30 or one o'clock in the afternoon, Washington was
                    about to convene another National Security Council meeting to be chaired by the
                    President. About every 10 minutes we're drafting this up and there was a lot to
                    go through. At that time we didn't have a computer screen on which you could
                    make corrections. We had to correct the text on green cable paper with sort of
                    inserts. It was a rudimentary communications system relative to what we have
                    now. I got my cable off, and about every 10 minutes I'm getting a call from
                    National Security Council saying, “Where's your cable? The president wants to
                    convene this National Security Council meeting and we need your cables.” I'm
                    saying to them, “We're getting it out as fast as we can. If you keep calling me,
                    you're keeping me away from doing the writing and editing.” We did get them all
                    out in time for the National Security Council meeting. I guess the president's
                    calendar must have been such that he wanted to have this meeting on that morning
                    because he then was going off to Colorado, or maybe he was teleconferencing the
                    meeting or something, shortly thereafter with Maggie Thatcher. We got this all
                    out; by this time we had instituted, to insure the secrecy of the cable traffic,
                    a special code word encryptiocode word designator. We sent these cables out
                    marked “Secret.” For all intents and purposes, the only top secret material that
                    you ever send out has to do with a nuclear holocaust or, nuclear weapons. Our
                    cables were marked “Secret NODIS,” which means no distribution beyond a select
                    few. There was a further restriction on distribution by using the code word
                    “Babylon,” which was the word we used to describe the Gulf crisiDesert Shielat
                    the time. So these cable went out 'Secret NODIS Babylon.'</p>
                <p>The next day the long cable, the cable that was effectively the memorandum of
                    conversation, showed up on the front page of the New York Times word for word,
                    including some material that we might have edited out if we had had more time to
                    send the cable. That was a sentence that should have part of a previous
                    paragraph, but got dropped to a new paragraph, or vice verssomething like that.
                    I noticed it in the original draft, but said, “Let it go. Let's just get this
                    out. They will understand it in Washington.” The next day when the New York
                    Times carried the text of the cable, it included this editorial error that we
                    had allowed to go out. Not only had the correspondents been briefed on the
                    contents of the cable, but they actually had sen a copy of the “Secret NODIS
                    Babylon” cable.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Of course, the Iraqis were furious. This happened two days after the meetintime
                    devoted to drafting the cables and sending them out and then time to fall into
                    the hands of the New York Times and its publication. I get called from the
                    undersecretary, Nezar Hamdun. I am also furious because I believed in the
                    integrity of the system that says when you send it 'Secret NODIS Babylon' it's
                    not going to find its way into the press. Nezar says to me, “Look, what sort of
                    operation are you guys running? One, you take a confidential message from my
                    president to your president and you put it on the front page of the New York
                    Times; and, two, your president is asked whether he has received a message from
                    my president as he's walking down a stone walkway with the prime minister of the
                    United Kingdom.” Somebody from the press had asked, “Mr. Bush, did you receive a
                    message from Saddam Hussein?” and President Bush says, “No.” So Nezar said, “You
                    put it on the front page of the New York Times but you don't give it to the
                    president of the United States. What's wrong with you guys? Okay, be that as it
                    may, we're still waiting for the reply from the president of the United States
                    to Saddam's message.” I said, “Okay, got it. I'll get back to you.” I called the
                    Washington the task force, and the guy on the other end was Skip Gnehm. I told
                    him what Nezar has told me and I said, “Look, you guys need to understand that
                    my credibility here right now is pretty low because you guys have managed to
                    publish this cable.” In retrospect, I suspect it was probably the secretary of
                    State himself who gave it to the New York Times writer for domestic reasons,
                    because we were beginning to beat the war drums at home. I said, “But anyway, be
                    that as it may, how am I supposed to reply to Nezar?” Skip says, “You can tell
                    the Iraqis, one, the president of the United States received the message and,
                    two, if he wants to know what the American response is, he needs only to turn on
                    CNN.” I said, “Got it,” and went back to Nezar Hamdun and told him just that. I
                    was in his office, which by that time was wired up to CNN; CNN was on the
                    television set in the corner. I told him that, “The president got the message
                    and, two, if you want to know what the U.S. response is, look at CNN.” As I said
                    that, I turned to look at the TV monitor which was showing these big C5As taking
                    off from American bases every 10 seconds beginning to ferry American material
                    and equipment to the Arabian Gulf from all over. The deployment had begun. Then
                    the program cut away from the airfields to ports where American tanks were being
                    taken to be shipped across the ocean. This was just three days after I had met
                    with Saddam. Three days after that, at the same time that I was meeting with
                    Saddam, Dick Cheney was down in the Gulf meeting with the Saudis and showing
                    them the satellite overhead pictures which indicated that the Iraqis had
                    deployed all the way to the southern Kuwaiti border and that their logistic
                    supply lines indicated that they could potentially hit the eastern Saudi oil
                    fields, directly threatening Saudi economic interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you gotten any instructions from Washington up to this
                        point saying you should tell them that if they didn't get out, war would
                        come, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>WILSON: No; to this point the message was just to get out. The message was pretty
                    clear to get out; it was a message that they had not sent to me necessarily, but
                    one that they had given quite publicly. The drawing the line in the sand was the
                    initial reaction. It wasn't until November 6th or November 7th that the
                    President came out and said, “We will roll this back.” So in August September,
                    liberating Kuwait was not the objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the time period of “Desert Shield,”
                        which was for the protection of Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. The line in the sand was the Saudi Kuwait border, not the
                    Kuwait Iraq border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other embassies at that point, including what
                        would still be the Soviet embassy and obviously the British and French? Were
                        they looking to you to find out what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: As the situation evolved, that became the case. Our relations in the
                    first three days of the crisis with these other embassies were not as intense as
                    they were later. We were preoccupied with the welfare of our citizens and
                    getting our own policy right and getting our own communications right with
                    Washington. But as we went forward, we would have meetings. I would have
                    meetings every evening. We had a quartet that we would meet: the Turks, either
                    ambassador or DCM depending on who was in the country; the French charg�; the
                    Soviet, again either ambassador or more often the DCM; and myself. We would
                    meet, and discuss a number of different issues. I also would attend the EU
                    meetings and would share with them what we were doing. Because of the nature of
                    our relationship with Washington, we were much quicker than the Europeans in
                    acting; we basically would act and start our cables to Washington with,
                    “Assuming that this is what you would have done if you were in our place, this
                    is what we did.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in a way doing political analysis of both sides?
                        Obviously you were looking at Iraq to figure out what the hell they're up
                        to, but were you listening to the Voice of America, the BBC and other media
                        trying to figure out what was going on in the United States? Were you having
                        to sort of reach out to try to get the feel of what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>WILSON: Once we got past the first few days, after my meeting with Saddam, we saw
                    that the troops were moving and the Iraqis by this time had essentially annexed
                    Kuwait. They said that Kuwait was now the 19th province of Iraq. It became
                    pretty clear that we were in for the long haul. We were preoccupied again with
                    the welfare and whereabouts of our citizens. We were preoccupied with the
                    evacuation of embassy employees. By this time the Iraqis were rounding up
                    American citizens in Iraq, in Baghdad; we were one step ahead of them. We were
                    able to get out and pull most American citizens into our diplomatic quarters. We
                    got 150 people whom we lodged and fed in various diplomatic compounds. There
                    were another 115/120 that were identified as human shields; they had been caught
                    up in all of this and were unaccounted for. There were what we estimated to be a
                    couple thousand Americans in hiding in Kuwait; our people in Kuwait were running
                    a little operation to try to bring everybody safely into the embassy compound.
                    So we didn't have a whole lot of time to think about much more than how we were
                    just going to get everybody out in anticipation of a military action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody going around the streets of Baghdad trying to
                        get the mood of the people or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes; we were on the streets all the time, but during the initial days as
                    we set up our operation, we were focused on that. I was out all the time, but
                    most of our people were hunkered down. I was going back and forth to the foreign
                    ministry. I had everybody on the embassy side of the river, except for myself;
                    they would be able to get into the embassy compound quickly without having to
                    cross any bridges in the event the bridges were blocked or the bridges were
                    blown up in an attack. The only reason I stayed on the other side of the river
                    was because, one, my house was there but, two, more importantly, because the
                    foreign ministry was there. In the event of a crisis somebody had to be able to
                    go over and deal with the foreign ministry, and that was me. I had the armored
                    car and I had the flag, and as a consequence that's what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting anything from the Arab embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, but again this was after the first few days. The other thing that
                    happened during the first few days was we had the influx of the American media,
                    as I mentioned earlier. By this time Rather was in. Koppel had left. He had left
                    on the desk that he knew that Rather was going to be occupying, a little note
                    which he had written: “10:30 a.m., meeting with SH.” He left that casually on
                    the desk so that, when Rather came in, he would take a look at it and he would
                    think that he had been scooped by Ted Koppethat Koppel had gotten the first
                    meeting with Saddam, which he hadn't. Koppel still remembers it whenever I talk
                    to him, which hasn't been for several years now, but he always remembers that
                    little joke he played on Dan Rather.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>We're now, say, about the eighth or ninth of August; we held a meeting in my
                    office. We'd set up my office, the DCM's office, as the operations center; we
                    put the telephone therthe one that was hooked up to the operations center in
                    Washington 24 hours a day. We had a meeting that started late in the evening,
                    9:30 or 10 o'clock; it went until about three o'clock in the morning. At that
                    meeting was myself, the station chief who was the head of our CIA operation
                    there, the defense attach�, the political officer and the consular officeabout
                    five or six. During the course of these several hours, we gamed out all the
                    possible scenarios. Drawing upon our collective knowledge of Iraqi history
                    dating back to the time of the revolution in 1958 with the drawing and
                    quartering of several American employees of Bechtel, and the Iraqi reaction to
                    the outbreak of the Iran Iraq War, and what happened to an Iranian delegation
                    that was in Baghdad at that time, we concluded that the chances were really very
                    good that some of us sitting in that room then would not survive this particular
                    crisis. Some of might, but others might not. Therefore we concluded very early
                    on that some of us were probably going to die; that everything that we knew
                    about the way the Iraqis reacted indicated to us that some of us probably would
                    not survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out that there's always been talk of the
                        Arab mob taking violent action, but that there had really been only two
                        instances of a real Arab mob going after people and that was in Baghdad in
                        1958 and the other was in 1979 in Islamabad. When our embassy was burned, we
                        almost lost 130 people; we lost four or five. But the possibility has always
                        been thrown out there, as again it is today, but Baghdad particularly has
                        always stood out as being the exception.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We didn't fear the Arab mob because the Iraqi government controlled
                    everything from A to Z. We feared that the Iraqi government would give
                    instructions that the Arab mob should mobilize to take some of us out. The
                    Iraqis had been involved in running a defense attach� off the road when they had
                    not been pleased with some of the stories about U.S. sharing of intelligence
                    with Iranians or because of concerns about the U.S. willingness to sell arms to
                    the Iranians in exchange for the freeing of hostages in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Iran Contra operation run bOllie North and
                        company.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>WILSON: There was a long Iraqi history of intimidation of Americana long history
                    of not respecting diplomatic immunities and of actually killing people. So we
                    worked on that assumption; that was good because to a certain extent that
                    allowed us to come to grips with this whole question of “are you going to die or
                    not” early on; we became rather fatalistic about it. We basically concluded at
                    this meeting with the question that if we were all going to die, how did we want
                    to go down, how did we want to go out. Did we want to go out like sheep being
                    led to slaughter, or did we want to get out being very defiant to the bitter
                    end? We concluded that we were going to be defiant, and that set the tone of the
                    embassy from that time on. We saw this much less as a diplomatic nicety and much
                    more as standing up for what was right, and we comported ourselves in that way
                    from then on.</p>
                <p>Let me just add one thing to this. When I came out of Baghdad, I went over to
                    CIA, to talk to a psychologist who studies foreign leaders and their character
                    and their mental make up. During the course of discussing Saddam Hussein with
                    him, I asked, “What is the most effective way to deal with somebody with these
                    sort of character defects or this mental illness?” His response was, “The only
                    way that you can really deal with him is to stand up to him, to be defiant and
                    to be very much antagonistic and threatening.” That, in fact, is basically what
                    our strategy had been from the very beginning. Unfortunately the Agency had not
                    bothered to share with us their assessment of how we should deal with this
                    leader. We were sitting in Baghdad, without the benefit of their wisdom as we
                    developed our strategy. As it turned out, several weeks later the Iraqis
                    expelled a number of our employees. As I was taking them out to the airport to
                    put them on the airplane, they walked through customs to get on one of these
                    charter flights leaving the country. I realized that everybody who had been
                    expelled and was leaving the country were people who had been at this meeting
                    with me at which we had concluded that some of us were likely going to die
                    during this crisis. Everybody except for me was getting on that damn airplane. I
                    had not really thought much about it until then, but at that time as they were
                    getting on the airplane, I thought to myself, “Boy, you really did draw the
                    short straw this time.”</p>
                <p>You had asked earlier about dealing with other diplomats. It is a good time to
                    tell you the story about Dan Rather and the Egyptian ambassador and how we
                    planted a story that led to the release of women and children who were being
                    held hostage from Baghdad. In the first few dayfirst few weeks anywaafter the
                    invasion of Kuwait, the elitof American news broadcasting came through Baghdad.
                    As I mentioned earlier, the first one was Forrest Sawyer, the second one was Ted
                    Koppel, and the third one was Dan Rather. As I said, we had been thinking
                    through our strategy on what we were going to do. We had made the embassy about
                    as safe as we could. We hunkered down. We were working real hard to get the
                    human shields released. Saddam was attempting to paint a picture of himself as
                    the benevolent “Uncle Saddam.” He appeared on international TV with a 14 year
                    old hostage in a very eery photo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a British boy. I'll never forget that footage.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>WILSON: The footage was of Saddam standing with the boy in front of him; the
                    young man looked absolutely petrified. Saddam pats him on the shoulder, on the
                    head, and makes like he's just invited this guy over to spend a few weeks with
                    him in Iraq. Of course, the kid was there against his will; the kid's mother was
                    there against her will. It was very chilling, and I don't believe that it
                    achieve his propaganda aim. The propaganda aim was to convince viewers that
                    these people were not in fact hostages; that they were just being held
                    temporarily against their will, but they were being treated very well, as guests
                    as opposed to as hostages. We were looking for ways to counteract that. We
                    didn't want any piece of his propaganda to go out over the airwaves without its
                    being contradicted by truth on the ground as we saw it. So we were looking
                    actively for ways to make the point that what he was doing was in fact not
                    benevolent, but it was malevolent and it was really inappropriate not to mention
                    a violation of various international conventions that governed conduct in such a
                    situation. About this time, the Egyptian ambassador called me and invited me
                    over for tea that the afternoon; I went. He was a very good guy. The Egyptians
                    had several millions citizens in Iraq. They were doing a lot of construction
                    work; they basically backstopped the Iraqi industry while Iraq's boys and young
                    men were at the front or in the guard units, either in the army or in a sort of
                    national guard guarding the pipelines and oil facilities. The Iraqis had the
                    Egyptians coming in to do the menial worbricklaying. painting and building and
                    stuff like that. I went to see the Egyptian ambassador; we were sitting there
                    talking and he said, “You know, Saddam has just built this big statue to himself
                    at the Arab Conquerors SquarArab Heroes Squarand he's taken down the statue of
                    an Arab on horseback to be replaced with a 40 foot high statue of himself. At
                    the same time he's done that, his people have gone around and instructed all the
                    various business establishments in Iraq that might have the Arab Hero in their
                    business title, or Arab Conqueror in their business title, to change their names
                    of their businesses because there is only one Arab hero in Iraq and they were
                    not it. So, for example, if you were in Baghdad and you had the Arab Hero
                    Drycleaner, somebody would knock on your door and say that you had to change the
                    name of the business because there's only one Arab hero and they were not it.
                    “So,” the Egyptian ambassador went on, “what we ought to do is to turn this Arab
                    Hero stuff on its head. We ought to make the point that Saddam Hussein, who is a
                    self styled Arab conquering hero, is really nothing more than a coward because
                    true Arab heroes do not hide behind little children or the skirts of women.” I
                    thought that was a pretty clever idea. I went back to my officand this was
                    literally a couple nights before Rather was supposed to leavas we did on most
                    nights, to smoke cigars and talk about what had gone on during the day. My
                    relationship with the press was such that I would give them a background
                    briefing in the morning and usually one in the evening. They would come to brief
                    me on their activities during the day. Rather and I were sitting around talking
                    and I told him this story, and he said, “That's a great one. I think maybe I'll
                    use that.” I suggested that he not use it in Baghdad because, even though he was
                    the great Dan Rather of the American airwaves, they might not appreciate the
                    story in Iraq, and they did have a tendency to kill journalists. They had just
                    killed this Iranian born British journalist a couple of months earlier. So he
                    didn't. He left the next night, and when he got to Amman, JordaI was told this;
                    I didn't hear ihe used this story in one of his broadcasts; that was maybe on a
                    Thursday or Friday night. On the next Monday or Tuesdaagain I was told this; I
                    wasn't able to pick up this information directlMaggie Thatcher went to the floor
                    of the House of Commons and pretty much used the same language in denouncing
                    Saddam: “True Arab heroes do not hide behind the skirts of women and behind
                    little children.” Within about four or five days, Saddam announced that women
                    and children would be permitted to leave Iraq, which basically opened up that
                    floodgate, so we almost at once were able to have the hostages that we had in
                    our custody released from the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a great relief. Did you think that the
                        United States was going to attack at any point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I thought from the very beginning that the United States was going to
                    steel itself for an attack. I never doubted for a second that the president and
                    his War Cabinet had the political will to roll back the invasion of Kuwait by
                    military means if necessary. I felt that really from day one. That was an
                    operating assumption in everything that I dithat I was backed by the military
                    might of the United State. I believed that really starting with my first meeting
                    with Tariq Aziz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Iraqi military might? You
                        know, there was a tendency in the United States to play these people as if
                        they were 10 feet tall; they turned out to be considerably shorter pygmies
                        as far as military prowess, but then they had just finished defeating Iran
                        in a huge war. What was your impression of Iraqi military power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: First of all, they hadn't defeated Iran; they had fought Iran to a
                    standstill. Not much territory changed hands by the time of the cease fire. The
                    first question to negotiate in the aftermath of the Iran Iraq War was where the
                    border between the two countries was going to be, whether it was going to be on
                    one of the banks of the Shatt al Arab or whether it was going to be in the
                    middle of the Shatt al Arab. So there really wasn't a clear victor in that war.
                    Secondly, and perhaps more to the point, we fully understood that Saddam had a
                    large and experienced military ground force; we fully understood that he had
                    exotic weaponri.e. chemical and biological weaponand that he had already
                    demonstrated a will to use chemical and biological weapons in artillery shells
                    against Iran and in gas attacks against the restive Kurdish population in the
                    northeast of the country in the aftermath of the cease fire. So we understood
                    that he had a large and experienced ground force. We also understood that there
                    were some gaping holes in Iraqi capabilities. This came out really in the
                    invasion of Kuwait. We knew that the Iraqi military forces lacked a good
                    logistical support base, so while the tip of the spear was experienced and
                    bloody and it knew how to kill and how to wage war, supporting those troops once
                    they moved forward was a challenge for the Iraqi military forces. In fact, when
                    we went bacwe did this in our review of the military capabilitieto look at the
                    Iran Iraq War, we noticed that every time the Iraqis would get five kilometers
                    beyond their logistical support bases, they would get bogged down. They could
                    never move their support bases up to where their troops were when they got too
                    far ahead. When they got to Kuwait City, there was some evidence that they were
                    prepared to go all the way to the eastern oil fields of Saudi Arabia around
                    Dhahrahad they done that, it would have changed the nature of our reaction
                    considerably. But it was clear that even by getting to the southern Kuwait
                    border, which is as far as they got, they had outrun their logistical support
                    capacity, so they themselves bogged down in Kuwait. Even if they had made a
                    political decision, it's not clear whether or not they had the military capacity
                    to go into Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Q: Even before the invasion started or up to it or particularly in the early days
                    of the invasion, was anybody from Washington asking you for an appraisal of the
                    Iraqi military?</p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. We had periodically done appraisals. We had a military attach� who
                    was doing readiness and order of battle reports on the Iraqi military all the
                    time. In addition to the logistical support issue, we also understood early on
                    in the war that they lacked a lot of M&amp;R capabilitmaintenance and repaifor
                    their material. As the sanctions that we imposed and then the United Nations
                    later imposed began to bite, we started a project to take a look at the impact
                    of the sanctioninitially on the economy as a whole. As we refined the goals of
                    the project, we determined that looking at the economy as a whole wasn't going
                    to give us the information we needed; so we narrowed the target to what the
                    sanctions were doing to the military infrastructure. For example, we would test
                    fuelwe had some guys who knew how to do thifor the additives, because while Iraq
                    had a lot of gasoline and refining capability, they didn't have some of the
                    additives to make the fuel really good for their engines. They lacked the
                    additives which meant that their engines were going to wear down requiring a
                    higher maintenance program. We also projected tire utilization for their trucks,
                    because they couldn't get spare tires in to replace the old ones. We went out
                    and we looked at certain hardware, particularly trucks along the side of the
                    road and things like that, and extrapolated from that that, while the sanctions
                    in and of themselves would not in the short term bring down the Iraqi economy,
                    they did have an impact in specific sectors. We said that one could reach the
                    conclusion that the Iraqi economy was like a house of cards or one of these
                    little stick structures, and that if you kept pulling the card or stick out,
                    eventually it was going to collapse. We said however that that was not the right
                    analogy, but that rather what would happen would be that the economy would just
                    grind down. Those who were driving Cadillacs today would be driving Volkswagens
                    tomorrow and riding donkey carts 10 years from now, but the economy itself would
                    not collapse. On the other hand, in terms of the executing our military
                    strategy, which is where we thought we ought to really be taking this analysis,
                    you would be able to detect rather quickly the difficulties that would crop in
                    the logistical support that the war machine in Kuwait needei.e. getting tanks
                    and trucks up and running and keeping them up and running. That's what we began
                    to focus on. And I think that our analysis was accurate. I think history has
                    shown that the economy did grind down. We basically concluded that the way to
                    look at sanctions was not as a strategy but rather as a tactic that allowed you
                    to weaken your enemy before you ever fired the first bullet, and that's in fact
                    what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our generals including Colin Powell and Admiral William
                        Crowe, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were saying at that time was
                        to let sanctions run their course on the assumption that that would cause
                        the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was never going to happen. It was particularly Crowe and David Jones,
                    who went up on the Hill...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Jones being an Air Force General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He'd been the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He'd been an Air Force
                    General. They went up on the Hill and testified during the debate on the “Use of
                    Force” resolution. Admiral Crowe's testimony was particularly troubling because
                    he had been the chairman who had been appointed and reappointed by George Bush.
                    For him to testify while apparently not privy to the same information that we
                    hawhich we had shared with the Agency and with relevant American authoritieand
                    making the argument that we shouldn't use military force, was the wrong argument
                    and sent absolutely the wrong signal to the Iraqis. The lesson for Saddam
                    Hussein from Crowe's testimony was that the American military would not stand
                    behind their president; that was very disconcerting for us because we were right
                    in the throes at that time of making great progress on the release of the 115
                    human shields and the rest of the people that we had in hiding in Iraq as well
                    as Americans who might have been in hiding in Kuwait. As soon as Crowe and Jones
                    gave that testimony, all our efforts came to a stand still; it took us about a
                    month to get things back on track and to leverage the release of these hostages,
                    because a lot of our strategy was predicated on our assumption that in the grand
                    scheme of things the U.S. was prepared to sacrifice the hostages in order to
                    achieve its military aims and, that therefore, it was not in Saddam's interest
                    to keep the hostages, because the anger, if something were to happen to the
                    hostages, in the United States would have been such that that in and of itself
                    might have forced the president's hand. We were telling the Iraqis, “You have to
                    decide what you want to fight the war over. If you want to fight the war over
                    mistreatment of some Americans who are being held hostage, that's one thing. If
                    that's not what you want to fight the war on, then you ought to get this off the
                    table and then we can go back to the core issues.” To this day, by the way, I
                    have not forgiven Admiral Crowe for that testimony. I talked to President Bush
                    when the book he wrote with Brent Scowcroft was in the galley proof stage and I
                    recounted to him just what I told you. He went back and edited his book and
                    added a gentle barb in it about the effects of Crowe's testimony. But to this
                    day I find it very difficult to be in the same room with Admiral Crowe.</p>

                <p>WILSON: When Saddam was moving his troops into Kuwait, we were talking about war.
                    In my own case, during my first conversation with Tariq Aziz on August 2nd, I
                    said that with his troops in Kuwait City and our naval ships in the Persian
                    Gulf, it behooved us at this tense time to avoid miscalculations. I used that to
                    leverage 24 hour a day telephone contacts between the embassy compound and
                    Washington. The embassy compound included USIA's Cultural Center. After we got
                    through the cycle of Rather and Ted Koppel and the other heavyweights, we
                    decided, as I mentioned earlier, that we needed to preserve the integrity of the
                    front office and keep the press out of there except when specifically invited.
                    So we moved the press over to the Cultural Center across the street, which was
                    fine. It still gave them the opportunity to file directly, because it was the
                    only place in town that could get direct connectivity with their home
                    offices.</p>
                <p>With respect to talking about war the rest of the time, the only person after the
                    first evacuation, after the 11th or 12th of August, left at the embassy who was
                    in a position to talk to the Iraqis was me. I had a political officer who would
                    accompany me when I went to see Taziz or other high ranking officials.</p>
                <p>But in terms of dealing with the Iraqis, I was the focal point. That became an
                    issue when we offered our views on whether April Glaspie should return. We said
                    that we thought that she should and that the political heat of having her come
                    back and having this played out in the American press as the United States
                    returns an ambassador to Irathe symbol of American respect for this potentate
                    who's just invaded his neighbocould be offset by having her come back in a
                    convoy with all the other European ambassadors who had been out on vacation at
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>The Department decided not to send her back. About three weeks later, because my
                    wife was really very emotionally upset, I argued that one of the actions that
                    might be takeso I could deal with this issue while at the same time maintaining
                    a core of credibilitwould be to leave Iraq to accompany Jim Baker on his trip to
                    Jordan and then to Russia and the European capitals, which would have given me
                    maybe four or five days away from Baghdad during which I could have managed to
                    calm my wife down before coming back. But the Department wouldn't let me come
                    out because they were afraid that the Iraqis wouldn't let me get back, and then
                    there wouldn't be anybody who could talk to them. That's about as close as you
                    can be to being indispensable. When I put my finger in the water, there was in
                    fact a whole a left after I took my finger out.</p>
                <p>Q: All of us who have gone through times of crises find that, unlike the military
                    who often leave their wives behind with a support system, we usually arrive with
                    wives unless things really get tough and the wives are taken out with not much
                    of a support system. This is a great strain on the wives, on the family, and on
                    the officer. Could you talk just a touch about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>WILSON: In our case it was particularly difficult. After the Iraqi invasion of
                    Kuwait, we imposed the Presidential Executive Order which was followed by a UN
                    embargo on trade with Iraq. That meant that everything from initiallI think I
                    told this stortelephone communication, for which we had to get a waiver, to
                    regularly scheduled airliners and other flights became very limited. We obtained
                    waivers for humanitarian evacuations of the people who were being held against
                    their will or were stuck in Kuwait and Iraq, but otherwise we couldn't get
                    people on airplanes. So the only way that we could get people out was to drive
                    them across the desert, which was about a 12 hour drive, to Jordan or to drive
                    them through Iraq to Turkey. We began organizing these evacuations literally on
                    the second day. We went to a complete drawdown posture. We negotiated with the
                    Department how far down we were going to get and we ended up getting down to
                    about seven or eight in the first evacuation. The timing of the evacuation was
                    further complicated by an Iraqi requirement that they be given a 10 days'
                    advance notice before left an area more than 25 miles outside of Baghdad; they
                    were pretty inflexible about that. In addition, ordinary citizens had stopped
                    traveling, so that it was very difficult for people without diplomatic passports
                    to leave the country. Then, of course, the Iraqis were taking these people
                    hostage; we couldn't risk exposing our citizens to the Iraqi street for fear
                    that they would get picked up and turned into hostages. In fact, some of the
                    Americans that we took in and put in our diplomatic quarterthat's why we were
                    housing them all in diplomatic quarters, because these were sacrosanct, they
                    were inviolatwe couldn't keep there. We weren't going to force them to stay
                    there; they would get antsy and they would go out to go do some shopping or
                    something like that and would get picked up. We had a half a dozen guys who were
                    staying with us who just decided they were going to go shopping or go back to
                    the house and pick up their stuff; they got picked up and were made hostages.
                    For our own people we managed a number of evacuations. The first one was to
                    Jordan. The invasion was on the second and we were able to get them out on about
                    10th or 11th or 12th. The first group included the young girl that I had
                    mentioned earlier that we had managed to get the Iraqis to give to us. They got
                    all the way across to the Jordanian border, but were stopped because the
                    coordination between the Iraqis in Baghdad and at the border was not very
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were stopped by the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: By the Iraqis. They had to turn around and come back. If you've ever run
                    a convoy, you understand that there's sort of a mathematic formula related to
                    how many cars in the convoy and how fast that convoy is going to move
                    across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I led a convoy once, and it's the damnedest thing. You go
                        fast and then slow.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>WILSON: You ultimately end up going as slow as the slowest car in the convoy. I,
                    of course, didn't know what was happening to any of the convoys. It was only in
                    the aftermath that I realized that I would have to be more patient about their
                    progress; we didn't have any communication with them, so we would just worry
                    about whether they'd made it across to Jordan. It took them 20 hours to drive to
                    the border and back. Maybe it took them a little bit longer. They came back.
                    Organizing the convoy involved a certain amount of deception because we did not
                    want the Iraqi authorities to know precisely when the convoy was leaving or from
                    where it was leaving; we didn't want to run the risk that they would pick up
                    everybody on the way out of town. The convoy left a few hours before we said we
                    were going to leave. It left about sunrise. They drove all day through the
                    desert. This was in August and it was very, very hot. Some people took their
                    animals. There were two or three people to a car. We had our Marine security
                    detachment accompany the convoy because we had already shredded all of our
                    documents; therefore, their mission in Baghdad had been accomplished. We sent
                    out all of the spouses and most of the nonessential employees. As I said, they
                    got all the way to the border, but were not allowed to cross the border. They
                    called me through the public telephone system. I was in constant communication
                    with the foreign ministry. I told the people in the convoy to stay where they
                    were. They didn't stay, but turned around and came back. On about one third of
                    the way back, I got word from the foreign ministry that the borders were open
                    and that the convoy could cross into Jordan. But we couldn't get in touch with
                    them so they drove all the way back to Baghdad. We put the people in the convoy
                    to bed and sent them back to the broader the next day, at which time they
                    finally got out. It was extraordinarily stressful for them, for us and for
                    everybody involved, but we did get them out.</p>
                <p>There was a second group that we had to evacuatand this was a good thing frankly.
                    There was so much stress within the families that it was impacting on our
                    employees' ability to do their work. Among our staff there were some employees
                    who had drawn the same conclusions as we had drawn in our meetinnamely that some
                    of us were likely not to survive. They had concluded that they did not want to
                    be among those who wouldn't survive. So as almost a sideline, I would have
                    people that we considered to be essential employees, because of the roles that
                    they had in our embassy, coming to me and saying that I had to find a way for
                    them to leave because they were afraid they were going to die in Iraq. That was
                    another issue that we had to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chas Freeman talked about this when he was in Saudi Arabia
                        at the time. He said he was surprised. There were some people who just
                        couldn't take it. He just had to get them out because they just couldn't
                        take it. Some of these were rather key people. He said that he was a little
                        bit unhappy because this attitude didn't seem to affect their careers later
                        on. He felt that they'd let their side down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>WILSON: I take a somewhat different view of that. Everything that I did with my
                    employees, any confidences that they may have shared with me about their
                    personal fears and concerns and their desires to leave, stayed with me. We found
                    other reasons for them to go. In a way, the fact that their careers weren't
                    impacted suggests to me that either this attitude was uniqua once in a lifetime
                    deaor else the system isn't set up in such a way that it can weed out people who
                    are selected for leadership positions but who don't exhibit the sort of
                    leadership qualities under fire that one would need in any particular
                    servicwhether it's ours or the military. We did have one case where a guy came
                    to me with his wife, who was our FLO, our Family Liaison Officer; he made the
                    case, because he wanted her to be with him, that she ought to stay. There was
                    some grounds for that because we had a lot of hostages and people for whom she
                    could serve as a counselor. Then two days later he came to me and told me she
                    was pregnant and therefore she had to go. These were the little things that one
                    deals with as management.</p>
                <p>In time we got ourselves down to about seven in this evacuation, but we still had
                    all these people in Kuwait. They were estimating that there were over 100
                    Americans in Kuwait, all stuck inside the embassy compound. In addition, there
                    may have been some Americans who were in hiding. In fact, we estimated that
                    there were about 2,000 Americans in Kuwait, but we could never verify that. Our
                    focus then became to try to get these people out of Kuwait. By this time the
                    Iraqis had annexed Kuwait and they were continually moving in a threatening
                    fashion around the embassy compound. They were looting embassy houses around
                    town. I would get calls saying they were going to take over the embassy tonight
                    and that I needed to do something to stop them. These calls would come to us via
                    the State Department. But it had become sort of a stalemate. Nat and his staff
                    had decided that they had adequate supplies, they were conserving their energy,
                    they had the famous swimming pool, their water supply...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain the swimming pool.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>WILSON: They had their water supply and they had the swimming pool there in the
                    compound. When the swimming pool started getting a little dirty, they dug a
                    well. They demonstrated how self sufficient they were; they were going to get
                    their own water, which they did. I think they actually did find water in one of
                    the wells they dug. About this time we started talking about what would the
                    Iraqi reaction be if we were to draw down our diplomatic presence in Kuwait. I
                    broached this subject with the Iraqis and got my knuckles wrapped by the
                    Department because it was premature and they hadn't thought their way through
                    that. Ten days later they asked me to go in and make the exact same
                    representation I had made. Go figure. In my meeting with Tariq Aziz on this
                    particular subject, I asked them how they would react if we were to reduce the
                    size of our diplomatic presence in Kuwait City by bringing the nonessential
                    diplomats and their families not just out of Kuwait, but out of the region. His
                    response to me was that Iraq would abide by all of the relevant conventions,
                    meaning the Vienna Convention, concerning the movement of diplomats from one
                    country to another in times of conflict. As a consequence, I made a case that we
                    ought to go ahead and withdraw nonessential diplomats out of Kuwait, perhaps
                    first to Baghdad, and then prepare to move them out of the region. There were
                    going to be about 100 people leaving, maybe about 20 from the embassy
                    compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say nonessential diplomats, were you including
                        other people who had taken refuge in the compound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, family members and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean also private citizens such as oil people or
                        financial people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>WILSON: The oil people were somewhat different, but we were going to try to move
                    them as well. Actually we thought that we were going to be able to get all of
                    them out. In light of the Vienna Convention and then the Geneva Convention, if
                    Americans were in our custody when they came to Baghdad, we thought that we
                    would be able to get them exit visas so that they could then leave Baghdad. When
                    Tariq said that to me that the Iraqis would abide by the conventions, I went
                    ahead and said, “Yes, this is what I recommend.” Nat Howell sent off a cable
                    saying, “Tariq Aziz is a low life doublcrosser, and he's no doubt going to
                    double cross us on this. They'll get up to Baghdad and they'll get stuck in
                    Baghdad.” I sent off a cable in response to Nat's saying, “I agree fully with
                    the distinguished ambassador's assessment of the Iraqi foreign minister. That
                    said, however, our experience has been that the Americans in Baghdad are, by and
                    large, safer and better taken care of than those who are stuck in the embassy
                    compound in Kuwait. The diplomats who are already here are allowed to move
                    around. They have access to food in the market. They don't have to worry about
                    Iraqi troops coming over the walls every night. So in my judgment, even if Tariq
                    does what Nat suggests he's going to di.e., double cross uit is still a net plus
                    for these people to be in Baghdaone country closer to freedothan to be stuck
                    inside the embassy compound in Kuwait.” I'm told that this cable debate went to
                    the president of the United States, which is not unusual in a situation like
                    this involving American citizens. Nobody wants to have their fingerprints on
                    these decisions if they can get somebody else's fingerprint on them; so they go
                    all the way up to the big enchilada. I'm sure the file went up to him with a
                    little note saying, “I think that we ought to do this.” The president checks the
                    action he wants taken, and they do it. I'm told anyway that it went to the
                    president and the president decided that he would go with the recommendation
                    made by Joe Wilson. What does Joe Wilson think out there in Baghdad? The
                    president approved my recommendation and we sent a guy to Kuwait to lead a
                    convoy to Baghdad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>WILSON: Charlie Sibel was his name. He was a political officer. Charlie went to
                    Kuwait. He was an experienced Arabist; he could speak Arabic, and he helped the
                    people in Kuwait to organize. We got everybody together, we got cars and we
                    moved well over 100 people to Baghdad. The convoy left Kuwait about eight
                    o'clock in the morning for about an eight hour drive. We figured that we would
                    see them about four o'clock in the afternoon. Once again, we lost contact with
                    them, and we did not see them until three o'clock in the morning. When you are
                    responsible for American lives, you tend to worry. We spent a lot of time
                    between when we thought they should arrive, which would have been around 4:30
                    p.m; we had not yet figured out that the longer the convoy, the slower it moves.
                    We had not internalized that lesson. So when it became about four o'clock in the
                    afternoon, we began to worry and did not stop until three o'clock in the morning
                    when they finally showed up. For some reason, I had a clipboard with me. All day
                    long we had been working on preparing for the evacuees. We'd gotten food because
                    we were going to have a big barbecue. How do you feed 120 refugees? We had set
                    up beds and mattresses. We had taken over the Marine house and made it basically
                    a flop house for everybody. We put a lot of water there as well as beer; we put
                    everything there to make the evacuees as comfortable as we could. As I said, the
                    convoy arrived at about four o'clock in the morning. I went downstairs, still
                    with the clipboard in my hand. I was walking around saying, “Welcome. This is
                    what we're going to do.” Some man who was about 6'4” and looked like an old pro
                    football defensive en6'4” and about 300 poundcame up to me and starts berating
                    me, asking me a lot of logistical questions. I finally said, “Take this up with
                    the GSO,” and he said, “Well, who the hell am I talking to?” I said, “Well, I'm
                    in charge of the embassy.” That didn't stop him. He was plenty pissed off after
                    having spent 15 or 16 hours in the car. But he and I later became the best of
                    friends. We finally got everybody bedded down at four o'clock in the morning,
                    and we said, “This is what we're going to do. We're going to take all your
                    passports”we collected everybody's passport“ and we're going to get the exit
                    visas”the Iraqis promised us that they were going to open up their office at six
                    o'clock in the mornin“and we'll get you back on the road. We'll get you up to
                    Turkey. It's going to be a long night and a long day, but you're going to be out
                    of here.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were taking them to Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>WILSON: We were going to Turkey. This convoy we were going to run to Turkey. We
                    had everybody set on the Turkish side. So we took the passports to the
                    authorities, only to find that nobody was there. Then the Iraqis decided that
                    they were not going to issue exit visas, and by about nine o'clock in the
                    morning it was pretty clear we had been double crossed. I went to talk to Nezar,
                    and the answer I got from the Iraqis was, “What the foreign minister told you
                    was that when you closed your embassy in Kuwait, all the diplomats and members
                    of the mission would be permitted to leave. Your embassy is not closed. The
                    American flag is still up there. Therefore, these people will not be permitted
                    to leave.” I said, “Well, that's no excuse,” and he said, “You know, Kuwait no
                    longer exists. It is no longer a sovereign country. Therefore, these people no
                    longer have diplomatic immunity. Therefore, the Vienna Convention does not apply
                    to them; so they're not going to be permitted to leave. They're subject to all
                    the same travel restrictions as everybody else right now. I then made the case
                    that at a minimum they had an obligation under Saddam's own edicts to allow the
                    women and children in the convoy to leave, because they had already allowed
                    women and children to leave. There were about 60 women and children. I think the
                    whole convoy was about 127 peoplsomething like that. We were able to negotiate
                    the departure of the women and children.. We sent all their passports to the
                    Iraqi authorities and got the exit visas for them. In this group of women and
                    children were about, I think, four kids who were 1just right over on the adult
                    side of the line. They could not leave. Their mothers could leave, but these
                    kids had to stay. That was a real trying time for the mothers. We also had a few
                    interns, kids who had come out to do their internship in Kuwait and they had
                    just a wonderful time. We had them manning our telephone 24 hours a day. But,
                    you know, these were just kidyoung adults.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might interject right here that we have intern here,
                        Danielle Kerline, who's monitoring this as an intern working for the

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Wee like to believe that it's a little safer in downtown Washington.
                    Twenty four hours after we had initially anticipated, we finally got women and
                    children on the road. In those intervening 24 hours, while we were working full
                    steam to get the visas, we also organized an event at the Marine house. We
                    organized a barbecue; we had volleyball; we had beer and soft drinks, and we
                    invited everybody from all the embassies just to relax a little bipeople from
                    our embassy and from the U.S. embassy in Kuwait. We got people bedded down. Then
                    we got the ones who had to leave the next morning into the convoy's cars with
                    Charlie leading the way again. He drove them to the Turkish border, got them
                    across, and then turned around and came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with the Kurds at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, there was no problem, no problems getting to the Turkish border.
                    There was no Kurdish rebellion at the time, as least no more than usual.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The endemic Kurdish rebellion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The northern provinces were pacified at that time. They were under
                    control. We then ended up at my embassy with seven Americans who were accredited
                    to Iraone consular officer, a couple of military officers, and a couple of
                    administrative and secretarial stafplus approximately 63 Americans who were
                    accredited to our embassy in Kuwait. The management question became how do you
                    integrate these people whose loyalty is to their colleagues in Kuwait City and
                    whose experience with Iraqis consisted of being on the wrong side of Iraqi guns
                    for three weeks. How do you integrate them to make a functioning mission? And at
                    the same time how do you deal with all the morale issues attendant with the
                    experience that they'd gone through?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that you're talking about concern that the people
                        who had come out of Kuwait had no feel for the Iraqi situation and might
                        have a certain amount of hostility towards the Iraqi and, being ironic about
                        this, might almost screw things up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>WILSON: There were a couple of things we were worried about. One, we figured
                    that, if we couldn't keep them busy, they would be even more unhappy than they
                    were. Then, we had to overcome their hostility towards the Iraqi regime. We
                    didn't think that they would do something that would screw up our efforts,
                    because they weren't accredited in any way, so that they could not have any
                    official interaction with the Iraqis. What we worried about was that they would
                    become bored and very, very demoralized, which would be counterproductive to our
                    own efforts, to our own management. We wanted to channel the hostility. We
                    wanted to make them productive within the embassy. Their team leader, the guy
                    who led them to Baghdad was a guy by the name of Emil Skodon. He was the
                    economic commercial counselojust as solid as the day is long. We had a number of
                    really long talks about what to do, and we did some things that I think were
                    really very creative. We reactivated the Marine security guard detachment,
                    because the Kuwait Marines had come out with the convoy. One of the things that
                    we had found is that oftentimes the morale of the Marine security guard
                    detachment is directly reflective and impacts on, one way or another, the morale
                    of a whole embassy staff. So we did not want these Marines, who were young and
                    impressionable, in a less than disciplined structure; so we put some discipline
                    in their structure almost immediately. We reactivated the battalion. We made
                    them our Marines. We did it over their initial objections, but we did it and we
                    did fast. Once they started taking orders, they did a good job. The other thing
                    we did is was to make the American citizens, either in hiding or being held as
                    hostages, our principal point of focus at the mission level below me and we
                    organized a support system. We established a pen pal system. For every one of
                    our hostages being held, we had one of our people responsible for communicating
                    with them, sending them letters every week. I don't know if the letters ever got
                    there, but it gave these people something to do. We produced a weekly news
                    bulletin which we would tried to send to the foreign ministries of the hostages
                    which would include such things as football scores, recipes, anodyne stories
                    that had no political implication whatsoever, so that they would at least have
                    some sense of connectivity with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>We developed a scavenger group, which is one of the best things we did. We sent
                    these out to, one, get moneyou could exchange money on the black market at
                    incredibly favorable rates to uso that they would have enough dinar to purchase
                    supplies. With the embargo in place, we couldn't get a ready source of imported
                    food products anymore, so we sent people out with instructions to stock the
                    embassy in such a way that we would be able to feed 150 people for six to nine
                    months. That meant that they would go out, find sources for frozen food and for
                    dry food and canned food. The would go to the markets. The Iraqis were looting
                    everything that they could in Kuwait City, which they would bring back to
                    Baghdad. Open air markets where they were hocking all this stuff that they had
                    looted from Kuwait were growing up around Baghdad and other areas of Iraq. We
                    would have a group of our “guests” go out to buy stuff. In fact, we became so
                    well stocked in food and booze and everything else we needed that some of our
                    people actually started going out looking for some of the stuff that might have
                    been looted from their houses. That kept a bunch of them occupied. The Iraqis
                    were kind enough, to use the term loosely, not to pick up Americans who were
                    carrying diplomatic passports even if they were not accredited to our embassy in
                    Iraq; so our people were pretty safe looking around and shopping.</p>
                <p>We also set up a group to plot the movement of the human shields, and this was
                    particularly important. What happened was that, as time went by, Saddam would
                    release hostages periodically. He released French citizens because he thought
                    that that would cause the French to drop out of the coalition that had already
                    been marshaled against him. When these hostages were released, they would often
                    come to the embassy to bring us letters from American hostages. Through these
                    letters we were able to plot about 55/56 points on the map where they were being
                    held. Saddam did move the hostages every 10 to 14 days. We were able to plot the
                    movement of the hostages from one place to the next. The net result was that at
                    the end of a couple months we had a pretty good picture of the 56 places that
                    Saddam deemed to be of sufficient strategic value to put hostages in.</p>
                <p>Q: Was he doing this with British, too?</p>
                <p>WILSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You almost have a picture of people staked out in the
                        middle of an ammunition factory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. That is a pretty good image. I don't think they were
                    actually staked out there, but it is a pretty good image. Wee had and
                    international committee because the hostages came many countries. We had the
                    Japanese, ourselves, the Brits, Germans and the Frencwhen they were involved. We
                    would exchange information so that we had a pretty good picture of the hostage
                    situation which we would give to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>If you take a look at a map to pin point the first night's bombing raid of Iraq,
                    you'll notice that we'd sent the bombers over the places that Saddam considered
                    to be of strategic importance to him; you will find that they match up pretty
                    nicely with our analysis of where the hostage were, thank you. Saddam, by
                    keeping these hostages in a finite number of places and by moving them around to
                    a finite number of places, gave us a blueprint of what he considered to be of
                    strategic importance to him, and we used that. That was pretty useful to us. So
                    that was another group that we had.</p>
                <p>Then we had Americans who were being held in diplomatic quarters, as they were
                    called. They were American citizens who had not been picked up by the Iraqis,
                    but who had sought refuge with us, and we housed them. We put them all at the
                    ambassador's residence. There were anywhere from 35 to 50 on any given day. We
                    would essentially assume responsibility for their care and welfare. We had a
                    couple of cases of people who had to take antidepressant medications for various
                    problems., they ran out of their medication; that raised issues with people who
                    were off their medication and therefore not terribly well adjusted; we had to
                    deal with that. We had the usual issues of anybody in less than optimum
                    conditions, people doing things that they probably shouldn't be doing, drinking
                    too much too oftethings like that. And we had, of course, sort of the general
                    restiveness. We had a liaison office, and people would spend a lot of time
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any medical or quasi medical personneembassy
                        nurse or embassy doctor or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No permanent doctor. I don't know if we had a nurse. We had a doctor who
                    came in at one point and then flew back out, but that was it. So that was
                    basically the structure we had for these 60 to 67 Americans that we hosted. Then
                    we would have these Americans who would fly in thinking that they could make a
                    differencsome of them very notable. I made a policy of receiving them if they
                    came to the embassy, with the exception of former Cabinet members or very
                    distinguished Americans. When Jesse Jackson came, I went over to his hotel and
                    sat with him for a while. When Mohammed Ali came, I invited him to the embassy,
                    but also offered to go and see him. He declined the offer, but I sent my guy
                    Vern, a guy who was about 300 pounds. He became Mohammed Ali's escort officer.
                    For that assignment, Vern is eternally grateful because he got to spend a couple
                    days with the champ. When Ramsey Clark came, I put no restrictions on his
                    movement; that was true for all VIPs. I asked people in the compound if any
                    cared to meet with him because he had expressed an interest in meeting with the
                    Americans who were being held there in diplomatic quarters. They allowed that
                    they would be happy to see him. He came, and they jeered him, which was good. He
                    decided he did not want to meet with me; he didn't want to come to the embassy,
                    so I did not go to see hieven though he was a former Cabinet officesince he
                    didn't want to meet with me.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>I should note that one of the things that we tried to instill amongst the
                    Americans who were in diplomatic quarters was the same sense of defiance that we
                    were attempting to exude. I think we were pretty successful in doing that. I
                    used to go out to see them frequentlonce a week or something like that; I had
                    people from my staff out there every day. One of their representatives would
                    come to our daily staff meeting; so we had this liaison relationship with them.
                    I made a point anytime they asked me to come out, I would go out. We also
                    allowed them to set their own rules. They determined that they wanted to have
                    somebody who would serve as their spokesman with the press if the press wanted
                    any sort of feedback from them. We made some rules on where the press could film
                    within the ambassador's residence compound, which they accepted. The spokesman
                    that they selected was a guy who was a man of considerable experience. We did a
                    press barrage over the Thanksgiving Day weekend when I held a news conference
                    and then they interviewed him. They took pictures at my house. We were cooking
                    the turkey for some of the hostages. The press asked him what he thought as a
                    spokesman of the Americans being held in diplomatic quarters, and he said,
                    “Well, I've had a good long life, and I speak for everybody when I say this. We
                    would certainly like to live a lot longer, but damn it all, some things are more
                    important than us, and it is really very important that we roll back this
                    invasion of Kuwait. If it means that B52s have to come over Baghdad, bring them
                    on.” That was exactly the sort of reaction we wanted out of everybody. The
                    theory was that the only way to deal with the Iraqis was to be as tough or
                    tougher than them. Any sign of weakness would be pocketed by them and they would
                    be looking through.</p>

                        basically these have been sort of anti establishment figures, as has Jesse
                        Jackson to a certain extent. Did you consider them to be in a way sending
                        the wrong message? How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>WILSON: Our position at the embassy was one of studied ambivalence. We would
                    argue that they were violating the U.S. government's prohibition on travel to
                    Iraq, but having done that, they were still American citizens and therefore
                    still had the right to see the senior American representative if they wanted. We
                    were not going to deny them that. We welcomed any release of any hostages that
                    might occur as a consequence of their visits. But we made it very clear that we
                    thought that they were allowing themselves to be used by Saddam Hussein in his
                    cynical game of trying to divide Americans and to deflect attention from his
                    brutal invasion of Kuwait. We crafted this message through trial and error and
                    finally tuned the message to about where we wanted it and it was pretty much
                    broadly accepted as that. I mentioned earlier we had a symbiotic relationship
                    with the press corps. Because there were only really seven of us who were
                    accredited to Iraq and there were really only one or two who were going out to
                    see what was going on, we depended on the press quite a bit. We wanted the press
                    to be focused. We learned early on that the press needed to have a focus and
                    then they would all write the story. If you give them the headline, they will
                    write the story; so the trick was to give them the story right. Every morning I
                    would have an intelligence briefing, including information on Iraqi troop
                    movements in the Gulf or our own troops movements and how the situation was
                    shaping up. As I mentioned, the staff meeting would include the liaison officer
                    from the Americans, and during that staff meeting we would settle on the message
                    of the day. Then the staff would leave, and I would invite the press in with the
                    acting public affairs officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the acting public affairs director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: His name was Thibault. His first name escapes me. We would them answer
                    questions, but at the same time we would try and steer the press to the message
                    of the day. It was typically about what Saddam was doing, what had his cynical
                    behavior led to that day. We established a few ground rules for events that
                    occurred day after day. For example, we would have demonstrators in front of the
                    embassy every day. They were bussed in by the Iraqis, and they would stand in
                    front of the embassy and chant, “Down, down, Bush. Down, down, Bush,” and those
                    kinds of sentiments. They would show up about 10:15 or 10:30; that was always a
                    good time for me to take a coffee break and go out and smoke a cigar. My
                    agreement with the press was that if they wanted to film the demonstrators, that
                    was fine, and that if they would agree not to film me, then I would be happy to
                    be out there with them and answer any questions and chat with them and have an
                    exchange of information; that is what we would generally do.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Outside the embassy we would have these demonstrators. Behind them, because there
                    was an alley that was closed off, were a bunch of benches where people used to
                    sit to get their visawhen they were waiting to get their visas. I would go
                    around behind the demonstrators and sit on these benches and talk to whoever the
                    reporter of the day was, whether it was Jim Blystone from CNN or Dennis
                    Trouwhoever. They would film the demonstrators and I'd be sitting back there
                    smoking my cigar and talking to the press about what they were doing. That
                    worked out pretty well. Then in the evening when the press would come back from
                    their various forayoftentimes the Iraqis would send them on a field trip
                    somewhere to give them their side of the story. When they returned, I would go
                    over to their filing center, and we would talk and I would give them a “not
                    foattribution” quote if they wanted one or a “for attribution” quote if it
                    seemed to be appropriate at the time. At this time the State Department was even
                    more nervous than usual about too many people speaking to the press. The State
                    Department has always wanted just the secretary and the press spokesman to speak
                    on behalf of...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a very tight group around Jim BakeMargaret

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. Their edict to the Foreign Service had been that nobody can
                    speak to the press without Margaret Tutwiler's personal approval. That just
                    wasn't going to work in the Iraqi context; so we made an agreement that I could
                    speak to the press. For all intents and purposes Margaret and Marlin and I would
                    try and feed off each other...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marlin being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. That worked pretty well. One of the
                    first things I would do every morning would be review the White House and State
                    Department press briefings, so that I could see what Margaret and Marlin were
                    saying. Then I would try and figure out how to make that relevant to what we
                    were doing on the ground, and vice versa. We tried to coordinate our message to
                    give the press corps a coherent view. That worked pretty well except for one
                    occasion when somebody came up to ask me a question. I can't remember what the
                    question was, but it was something like “What would happen if Saddam were to do
                    something nefarious and execute a hostage or do something like that?” I
                    responded off the cuff using some glib phrasI think it was casus bella little
                    Latin from the California surfer. A couple of hours later, I got a phone call
                    from Washington. The voice on the other ensomeone from the task forcsaid, “We
                    just want you to know that Marlin Fitzwater and Margaret Tutwiler think the
                    world of you. They think you're doing a terrific job. They just want you to know
                    that. But we just got a call from the White House press officjust a gentle
                    reminder that, generally speaking, the president reserves unto himself the
                    ability and the right to declare war.” I said, “Okay, got it.” Other than that,
                    we were in pretty close sync.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>When Thanksgiving came, the president decided to go to the Saudi Arabia desert to
                    have Thanksgiving supper with our soldiers there. We for a few weeks had been
                    arguing that we ought to take advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday to do an
                    expos� on what the embassies were doing for American citizens in difficulty. We
                    thought we ought to do it because we were concerned that people might be losing
                    a little bit of focus on the plight of American citizens in the Gulf. We thought
                    it also would be good to burnish the image not just of our embassy in Iraq but
                    of U.S. embassies in generai.e. what an embassy does. We pitched this idea. This
                    was the only time in the whole crisis that I actually pitched something ahead of
                    time to Washington on a sort of public relations level. We didn't get a
                    response. So I called up and said, “We need a response.” They said, “We'll get
                    back to you,” but they didn't. So I called up again and said, “What do you
                    think? Do you want to do this over the Thanksgiving weekend? We want to have
                    them take pictures of us cooking our turkeys. I want to do a press conference
                    talking about the plight of the hostages. We want to have the hostage spokesman
                    speak to them. We wanted to be sure that our message was coordinated with any
                    other public relations efforts to be made around the world.” Finally they said,
                    “Look, nobody wants to tell you “no,” but what everybody's worried about is
                    that, if you do this, you will step on the president's story with his meal in
                    the desert with the troops. But the decision is yours.” That's always what they
                    say when they're going to fire you if you screw up. So I thought about it and
                    came to two conclusions. One, it was hard for me to imagine how our story was
                    going to step on a story about the president of the United States being in Saudi
                    Arabia. I thought that that was just not going to happen. Secondly, even if we
                    did step on the story and I got fired, that was not necessarily a bad thing. So
                    I concluded that we should go ahead and do it. It would have been good for the
                    embassy; it would be good for the U.S. to get the story, and I don't see any
                    particular down side to having it published. So we did it. I started out with a
                    press conference on Thanksgiving morning. I went over to the foreign ministry
                    with about 50 diplomatic notes related to individuals who were being held
                    against their will, insisting on their release. I was pretty fired up; I went in
                    to see the guy in the foreign office and I dropped all these notes on him and I
                    berated him. As I mentioned before. Then I went to a press conference where I
                    spoke for an hour responding to questions about why these hostages were being
                    held against their will. The press then went to see the spokesman for the
                    American citizens being held in diplomatic quarters, who said “bring on the
                    B52s. “ The press filmed in my kitchen and in the kitchen of these people the
                    food being served, and they filmed people sitting around having their
                    Thanksgiving supper. The Iraqis, perhaps anticipating what I was doing, invited
                    a bunch of Americans to give them a Thanksgiving in a house that was literally
                    just about a mile from mine; they had CNN over there filming that Thanksgiving
                    dinner. I don't know what they were thinking, but CNN rushed over to my place
                    after they had filmed the Iraqi dinner and asked for my reaction. I was standing
                    in my door with the cameras going and I said, “It was cynical and, in fact,
                    sadistic on the part of Saddam Hussein to do this to American citizens; having
                    them at a place less than a mile away from here and not even permitting an
                    American consular official to see them.” That was really the icing on the cakto
                    make the point that this was just inhumane treatment of American citizens. It
                    worked out great. Two days later I get a cable, addressed to Joe Wilson from
                    President Bush. “Dear Joe, I saw you recently on CNN talking about what you
                    thought of Saddam's despicable behavior,” something like that, and it went on
                    and said, “I could not have said it better.” Then there was another paragraph,
                    “It's relatively easy for us here in Washington to speak out, but what you guys
                    are going out there day in and day out is truly remarkable.” After that, I
                    figured that, we won our gamble. Aside from the fact that I didn't get fired and
                    therefore had to stay for another six weeks, we were successful in our
                    effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to sort of interject here. One of the things you
                        were doing was bypassing the spinners who think only in terms of their
                        principals, George Bush and Jim Baker. They're not even consulting their
                        principals particularly. They only think in one dimension. You have to
                        almost understand the topography of the Washington scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's exactly right. I think from our perspective, one of the reasons
                    that we were pretty successful in this is that we did understand that syndrome
                    and did nothing that detracted from their ownership of the Washington part of
                    it. Everything that we did was supportive of not just them but of their efforts.
                    There were some things that needed to be said. We needed to project an image of
                    strength and of 'devil may care' both to our own citizens and to the Iraqis. One
                    of the lessons that we have internalized from the Lebanese the hostages event,
                    for example, was that the rather plaintive wailing of the individual hostage and
                    his or her family made a largely a political story into a human interest story.
                    When you have a human interest story, it's very difficult for some in the
                    political world to do what needs to be done in the larger interest. Therefore,
                    we were insistent on creating an ambiance in our mission which made the larger
                    interests most important, far more important than our own personal situation,
                    and we got a lot of support from everybody involved in this. It was heartfelt.
                    First of all, we didn't have a lot of crybabies, and secondly, in our approach
                    to the issue, in our discussions, in our town meetings, in everything that we
                    did, we tried to project the national interest above and beyond our own narrow
                    personal interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into the problem that developed in Lebanon and
                        in Iran when the hostages' wives, sisters and all in the United States
                        became a power unto themselves saying “Get our people out,” and turned it
                        into a personal story. You understand what I'm talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. In fact, the wives came out a couple times on Iraqi organized trips
                    to see their husbands. I met with them and talked with them, and we attempted to
                    be very sympathetic to what they were doing, but perhaps because these hostages
                    were held only for three months as opposed to 18 months, the relatives were
                    unable to organize themselves into a power base. The second time they came, it
                    was to pick up their husbands. The first time they came, it was to see them. I
                    saw them as well. We went through a litany of what we were doing for their
                    family members, and we were doing a lot. We had this weekly broad sheet that we
                    were sending out to them. We had this pen pal system. We had stacks and stacks
                    of diplomatic notes. We encouraged people, if they had any sort of medical
                    ailment, to alert us to that so that we could make the case on their behalf. We
                    managed to spring a half a dozen hostages. Every time there was a visitor we
                    would have some input into which hostages got released, or we found loopholes in
                    the management of the hostage program so that we were able to go in and say,
                    “This person doesn't fit this category of hostage. Therefore, you should release
                    him.” We had some allies within the Iraqi foreign ministry that would allow that
                    to happen. We would get a couple out that way, and then they would close the
                    loophole and we'd have to go and find another loophole. We had a several pronged
                    strategy. One was that we just papered them with diplomatic notes to get these
                    hostages out. We would send notes like, “He suffers from hangnails. Therefore,
                    he really needs to be home. You need to do this,” anything would do. We tried to
                    be very positively responsive to any family concern about their loved ones. We
                    would go ahead and act upon it. We tried to find these loopholes, where we could
                    find them. We were able, during the evacuations of various groups, to make the
                    case that mothers and children should not be separated; it didn't make any
                    difference whether the mother was Kuwaiti or American. So long as the child was
                    an American, the mother should go with him or her. We were successful in that.
                    We were successful in getting one or two hostages out every time, and we would
                    try to load up hostages onto every American who came out. It didn't make any
                    difference to us. The more, the merrier. If we could get 10 out with Mohammed
                    Ali, if they promised us 10 we'd go for 12. So we tried to be very
                    responsive.</p>

                <p>The other thing that we tried to do diplomaticallI made this case starting in
                    Novembewas to say that Saddam should be under no illusion that by holding
                    hostages it was going to prevent war; on the contrary. I made that case in a
                    four hour lunch with a Palestinian journalist, a female Palestinian journalist,
                    who was firmly convinced that every insult ever visited upon the Palestinian
                    people for the last 2,000 years had been the fault of the United States. She was
                    no great friend of American policy, but she was a damn good journalist. She was
                    well connected in North Africa and in Jordan, so I thought I would try this line
                    on her, because it seemed to me that the frontal attack on the Iraqis was not
                    going to necessarily be a successful attack; we had to try and come at them from
                    another direction. I made the case directly, and I convinced her that the thesis
                    that I was advancing was a legitimate oni.e the thesis being that holding onto
                    the American hostages was not an asset; it was not going to prevent the war.
                    “Given a military action of the size contemplated by Pentagon military
                    planners”and you could see with 500,000 American soldiers in the desert what
                    we're talking aboubig Army, 7th Corps, and everything in the desert that the
                    planners, political and militar“ they have basically determined that the United
                    States could absorb the loss of 2,000 civilians, 150 hostages and 2,000
                    civilians and the 150 of us here in Baghdad. The Iraqis shouldn't delude
                    themselves into thinking that keeping hostages would prevent the American
                    military from throwing them out of Kuwait. On the other hand, what they really
                    need to take into consideration is the impact on American public opinion and on
                    the president's own maneuver flexibility if something happens to one of these
                    hostages and it becomes public knowledge. Imagine, if you will, an American
                    hostage dying either at the hands of some brutal Iraqi mob or even in a refinery
                    fire in which he happens to be caught in just because he's a hostage at that
                    site. American anger might be so great at that time that the president of the
                    United States would have no choice but to go to war to avenge the death of an
                    American citizen being held hostage. Therefore, it seems to me, quite to the
                    contrary of considering American hostages as assets, they ought to be viewed as
                    liabilities. They're not going to prevent war, but something happening to them
                    might in fact bring the war...”</p>

                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, but this was in private. I wouldn't have said it in public,
                    so it was okay. “Therefore, the Iraqis need to think about what it is they are
                    going to war for. Are they going to war over the hostages, or are you going to
                    war over territory which they have tried to conquer? They should not confuse the
                    two. If in fact in their deliberations they decide that it's over territory,
                    which of course it is, then they ought to just get the hostages off the table.
                    It's just one extraneous issue that's a complicating factor both for them and
                    for everybody else.” I spent four hours with her at lunch going over this with a
                    couple of hours devoted to trying to overcome her sense of angst because the
                    Palestinians were one of the most affected communities in Kuwait. They were the
                    ones who basically ran the Kuwait bureaucracy. To try and justify what he had
                    done, Saddam made the case that he invaded Kuwait to liberate Palestine, and
                    somehow he had gotten Yasser Arafat to go along with that fiction. There had
                    been massive upheavals in the Palestinian community in Kuwait. She herself had
                    an uncle in Kuwait who had gone a little bit off his rocker. She said she had
                    gone to see him. She said, “It was so sad. It was like he was on LSD, because he
                    would tell me, 'We're so glad they invaded Kuwait to liberate Palestine, but my
                    God, why did they do this to me?' looking at the wreckage of his home life and
                    his home.” We discussed all that. I laid this hostage thesis on her and she kind
                    of bought into it. I said, “Look, I don't care whether you write about it or
                    not, but I just think it's something that you ought to be aware of. Feel free to
                    share it if you think it's valid.” She was on her way off to north Africa; she
                    was to be in the north Africa scene, the riots in Algiers and Morocco and
                    everywhere else. About 10 days later I get a cable from Chris Ross, who was our
                    ambassador in Algiers at the time, which said, “I've just spent some time with
                    the Algerian Foreign Minister Hozalen, and he laid out a thesis as to why Saddam
                    is holding onto the hostages when they are really a liability rather than an
                    asset.” Then he went repeating the A, B and Cs of the thesis that I had laid
                    out. I thought “great, I'm starting to get some feedback. This is how we're
                    going to apply some pressure.” My point in doing this was to make the thesis as
                    the conventional wisdom around the region. During all of this, we're having the
                    “use of force” debate in the U.S. Senate, with Bill Crowe testifying to give
                    sanctions a chance. All our efforts to develop this thesis that the hostages are
                    a liability got sidetracked because Saddam began to think that the president was
                    not going to have the military supporting him. That stopped our strategy dead in
                    its tracks, but that's okay because our view of the hostages was becoming sort
                    of conventional wisdom. A couple weeks after that King Hussein and Arafat both
                    come to Baghdad. According to the Jordanian king's director of cabinet, in a
                    meeting with our ambassador in Jordan to review a meeting the king had with
                    Saddam, His Majesty and Arafat told Saddam that, “You ought to get rid of the
                    hostages. It's not an asset to you. It's a liability,” and went through
                    basically the talking points that I had put out to the Palestinian journalist.
                    About a week later the Iraqis announced that their defenses were then
                    sufficiently strong that they no longer needed human shields and, therefore,
                    they could go home. So it worked. I can't tell you that it was my interview that
                    actually did it, but I can tell you that we had sufficient amount of empirical
                    evidence to know that we could get under Saddam's skin and that we could get
                    things done, whether it was the release of women and children or other things,
                    by making him look bad or by just having other people talk to him in a way that
                    we perhaps couldn't do directly. Given that diplomats are always blamed for
                    everything that goes wrong in international relations, I'm fully prepared for
                    our embassy and our mission to take full credit for this little activity having
                    gone right, since we were the ones who were promoting the thesis and since
                    ultimately all of the hostages got released. That's why nobody every talks now
                    about the Iraqi hostages. It's because they weren't hanged. It's because they
                    weren't paraded around blindfolded and cause the U.S. government to react
                    instinctively; we got the thing solved in a reasonable period of time. We got
                    everybody out safely with the exception of one guy who had a heart attack after
                    they picked him ubefore he was ever made hostage, in fact before he even knew he
                    was a hostage.</p>

                        to use it, but were the Iraqis aware of what they'd stirred up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The Iraqi fundamental miscalculatioand it was explained to me by Saddam
                    in our meeting of August 6twas that the United States was unwilling to spill the
                    blood of 10,000 of its youth in the sands of Saudi Arabia, or the Arabian
                    Desert. He thought that we didn't have the staying power for the sort of war
                    that he contemplated. He was basing his view on a couple of things: one, his
                    ability to have stalemated Iran for 10 years; two, his understanding of our
                    experience in Vietnam; and three, his understanding of our experience with the
                    Marine barracks in Beirut and the various hostages in Beirut. He failed to
                    understand that we had in fact stayed in Vietnam for 15 years and that we had
                    taken 50,000 casualties there. Up until early November, he had basically made a
                    bet that if he could get the Iraq Kuwait issue thrown into the United Nations
                    system, then he could have 20 years in Kuwait. That bet was based upon his
                    understanding of the way the UN works, using the historical precedent of Israel
                    occupying Gaza and the West Bank from the 1967 war on. He envisioned some
                    toothless UN resolutions. He had already been the recipient of two resolutions
                    on his use of chemical weapons. Nobody remembers them because they had no biting
                    sanction to them. He anticipated that if he got the issue into the UN system, he
                    could spend 20 years jockeying and negotiating, while at the same time
                    plundering what was left of Kuwait, including pumping all its oil and moving
                    Iraqis into Kuwait City. At the end of, say, 20 years, he could hold a
                    referendum in which the people would choose to be part of Iraq. I think that was
                    pretty clearly his objective vis � vis Kuwait. His broader objective, I think,
                    was the same objective that is enshrined in Baath dogma, and that is one huge
                    Arab nation. He just assumed if there would be one Arab nation, why not have one
                    Arab leader, which then, of course, posed the threat to all the royals and
                    sheiks in the rest of the Arabian peninsula.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>What he didn't understaneven though we tried to make him understand thiwas that
                    the war that he fought with Iran was not going to be like the war he
                    contemplated against the United States. When we made the decision in early
                    November to move the 7th Corps to the desert and to move a lot of air assets out
                    of Alaska, out of the NATO region, we were essentially calling his bluff. Up
                    until that point, he had some reason to think that if he could keep this in the
                    UN, then he probably could win. He could debate the issue for 20 years. In early
                    November, when we brought the 7th Corps in and said that we were going to roll
                    back the invasion, we basically called his bluff. He didn't understand two
                    things about that. He didn't understand that, in moving the 7th Corps, we were
                    moving a heavy mechanized army. This was not the 101st Airborne, this was not
                    the 89th, this was not Special Ops; these were big tanks and big artillery and
                    big armored personnel carriers. This force was for a conventional war, which was
                    far different from trying to wrest him out of Kuwait with the 101st Airborne.
                    The second thing, and probably more important, that he didn't understand was
                    that we were bringing a lot of power out of the NATO theater of operations and
                    that we were bringing a lot of air assets out of Alaska. We wouldn't empty our
                    most strategic theater of operations of military assets unless we had convincing
                    assurances from the Soviet Union that they would not take advantage of our
                    relative weakness and mess around in an area of real strategic importance.
                    Thirdly, he clearly didn't understand that in the context of the Iraq situation,
                    we would have had to give Gorbachev the same assurances that he would have given
                    us, since we were going to moving a huge military establishment right next to
                    the soft underbelly of the Soviet Empire and its traditional area of influence.
                    I think all of these Saddam views represented a terrible miscalculation on his
                    part.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>There were a couple of things that we attempted to do to insure that Saddam fully
                    understood the consequences of his miscalculation if he did not decide to leave
                    Kuwait voluntarily. Onthis was my idea from Baghdawe tried to get the U.S.
                    military to put together a video of precisely how this war was going to be
                    fought. We wanted shots of an M1 tank going up sand dunes at 45 miles an hour
                    and as it comes to the top of the sand dune. the turret swivels 270 degrees,
                    lobs off a shot, and kills a tank four miles over the horizoaction shots like
                    that. We wanted to show pictures of close air support and actual the joint
                    operatiothe way that the U.S. military was going to fight this war on land, in
                    the air, and from the sea. We wanted to make the Iraqis understand that this was
                    not going to be a trench warfare as they had fought with Iran. We had hoped that
                    enough Iraqi generals would see the film and that they would determine that
                    their future was better assured if they went after Saddam than if they went
                    after the U.S. military. An American office, Wayne Downing, loved this idea and
                    actually made a video. He later became the general in charge of special
                    operations and, I think, is about to be assigned to be the counterterrorism
                    office in the White House. Wayne put together a wonderful video, but, as he told
                    me later, couldn't get the video distributed in a timely enough fashion to make
                    an impact because State Department voiced some concerns that we would come
                    across as being too bellicose if the existence of this video became widely
                    known. The logic behind that view escapes me. We had 500,000 troops on the
                    ground. We were about to wage war in which we anticipated taking 20,000 deaths
                    or casualties. If you recall, we had laid in stocks of blood, we had hospital
                    ships out there, we had the Dover Air Force base geared up to serve as a wartime
                    mortuary. We had hospitals up and down the East Coast prepared to take on the
                    casualties that we were anticipating. Somehow, somebody in the State Department
                    thought that a videotape, which might persuade some senior Iraqi generals to do
                    something other than fight the United States, was going to be too bellicose, too
                    warlike. So we couldn't get this tape distributed until it was too late, because
                    as we went down the road, it became pretty clear that for Saddam a military
                    victory was less important than a political victory. He, I think, saw victory
                    very much again in his own historical context. As an Arab, you achieve victory
                    by just having confronted the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little bit like Sadat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Actually much more like Nasser. You reap the benefits of a tremendous
                    political victory because you have had the audacity to confront the West; so it
                    was a Nasser style victory, which Sadat also employed in the 1973 war. It was
                    pretty clear by the time we got the video out that for Saddam just having the
                    war was in and of itself justified. Curiously that was just one of the other
                    missteps they took. With every step along the way from November 6th until
                    January 15th, every time Saddam had a fork in the road, an opportunity to get
                    out and save his army, he did something stupid, which made it much easier for us
                    then to keep the coalition together and go to war. By December, my greatest
                    concern was that he would take a partial step which might cause everybody to
                    stop in their tracks and require us to marshal the political will to go
                    forward.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. He had drawn a new border, which was really in the hills
                    overlooking Kuwait City. That would have given him the high ground over Kuwait
                    City and control of the northern Kuwait oil fieldthe Ramallah oil fields as
                    they're calleand also would have given him control of Bubion and Warba, the two
                    islands that were just in front of Emkasa, the port that he had developed at the
                    end of the Iran Iraq War. I think there was some concern that he would pull back
                    to that line posing for us the conundrum of whether or not to continue to drive
                    him all the way out of Kuwait or to accept the de facto line that he might have
                    imposed on us. So when Perez de Cuellar went out there...</p>

                <p>WILSON: He was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time. When French
                    President Francois Mitterrand started making noises that sounded like
                    appeasement, I think we were really concerned that there might be a partial
                    withdrawal from Iraq, which would then throw the coalition into absolute
                    disarray. But Saddam proved us wrong. He went right down the road to war.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The “use of force” debate. We were under no illusions. Our analysis
                    indicated very clearly that there was no incentive for Saddam to get out of
                    Kuwait. Sanctions were not going to get him out of Kuwait. He could survive
                    sanctions for 20 years. So from our perspective, it was not a question of
                    sanctions working to get him out of Kuwait. It was also clear to us, though, in
                    our more lucid moments, that it was important for us to have a full and complete
                    understanding of what we were doing and why we were doing it. As a consequence,
                    as inconvenient as the debate might have been, it seemed to us to be absolutely
                    necessary. In my discussions with peoplvisitors and the presthere seemed to be a
                    fair amount of pacifist energy being generated. Saddam has brought some of the
                    professional pacifists out to Baghdad. They had marched. Saddam was trying to
                    present himself as a man of peace and trying to present the United States as the
                    aggressor. This was beginning to take hold, so it was important to have a more
                    complete understanding of what it was we were doing in the area. The
                    administration had been not terribly adept early on. Jim Baker's comment about
                    “it's for oil and jobs” was probably as controversial as it was elucidating.
                    That said, it was clear to me and to the people who were with me in Baghdad that
                    the only way to get Saddam out of Kuwait was to do it with military force. I
                    conveyed that in a series of telephone conversations from ground zero to Speaker
                    of the House Tom Foley and to Al Gore, then the junior Senator from Tennessee
                    and who voted in favor of the resolution. He was one of the Democratic Senators
                    who voted with the president on the resolution. I called him, after he had
                    initiated telephone contact shortly after the invasion of Kuwait on a purely
                    personal note. He called mthe first person outside the State Department to get
                    through to mand asked me to stay in touch with him, which I was glad to do. I
                    called him during the “use of force” debate. I didn't realize the timing of the
                    phone call because we didn't get CNN; we got the wireless file. I called his
                    office, and they said, “He's not here. He's on the Senate floor.” I said,
                    “That's fine. I'll talk to him some other time.” They said, “No, we think he'll
                    want to talk to you.” So they patched the call down to the Senate cloakroom,
                    which is the room off the Senate floor where senators come to take calls and
                    meet people. Gore came off the Senate floor and took the call, and we spent
                    about 20 minutes talking about the situation. We talked about sanctions and we
                    talked about military action. I was very clear about the analysis that we had
                    done. It turns out that it was the day of the “use of force debate” on the
                    Senate floor and Senator Al Gore voted with the president on this. I like to
                    think that we had some influence in that particular debate. I'm sure we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>I also called Tom Foley and caught him in the midst of a discussion over the
                    budget resolution taking place in the Speaker's office. I said, “That's fine.
                    I'll call back.” They said, “No, we think he'll want to talk to you.” So Tom
                    gets on the phone and we're talking and he goes, “Mr. Ambassador,” and I said,
                    “Mr. Speaker, it's nice of you to promote me, but I'm not yet an ambassador.” He
                    said, “Mr. Ambassador.” Allow the Speaker his little foibles. If he wants to
                    make me ambassador, that's fine with me. He said, “Mr. Ambassador,” and then in
                    very special English slowly enunciating every syllable he says, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    I just want you to know that the debate in Washington may have people thinking
                    that there is division within the United States government. That is not the
                    case. This debate is a part of American democracy, something that we cherish,
                    but when the time comes, we will all be behind our president in this matter. Let
                    me repeat. Mr. Ambassador,” and he said it again. It was wonderful. We were
                    talking on an open line. I had called him on an open line on this. In fact, as
                    time passed, the less I used the secure line and the more I used the open
                    line.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At one point I had said to a friend of mine, “I'm looking forward to the
                    day when I can take Saddam's white horse and ride it through the rubble of his
                    palace,” which is on former U.S. embassy grounds. Several weeks later some
                    journalist came up and asked me if I had really boasted about riding Saddam's
                    horse through the rubble of his palace at some point.</p>
                <p>Both of these conversations, I think, were particularly useful and they certainly
                    set the stage. But within Iraq, as I have said, it was the Crowe testimony that
                    attracted attentiowhen I say Crowe, I single him out more than David Jones
                    because Crowe had been a Bush appointee, so he was known internationally as
                    having been Bush's chairman. When he broke with the president on Iraq policy,
                    the implication was that the military was not going to support the president.
                    Powell, I think, was far more circumspect; he voiced his objections, which were
                    held by the military across the board, to the president, but not in public. The
                    active military officers wanted to insure that the political leadership had
                    fully considered the consequences of military action and had fully defined the
                    mission before it gave the orders to the military.</p>

                        feeling that particularly the group around Jim Baker was focusing on April
                        Glaspie to hang her out to dry? They were accusing April Glaspiif only she
                        had said the right words to Saddam Hussein, none of this would have
                        happened. Were you getting that? And what was your reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>WILSON: Very clearly. In fact, President Bush (41), when I saw him down in
                    Houston several years ago, he asked me if I thought that April Glaspie had
                    gotten a bum rap. I said, “Yes, she did,” and he said, “Yes, I sort of thought
                    so, too.” I sat there with my mouth open thinking to myself, “She was the
                    president's representative in Baghdad. She was a president appointee, and if he
                    though she had gotten a bum rap, why didn't he do something about it?” From the
                    very beginning it was pretty clear that the goal was to scapegoat April Glaspie
                    on the grounds that perhaps she had given Saddam a green light or a yellow light
                    or what she had said to Saddam had been interpreted as a green light or a yellow
                    light. There were a couple things that might have given rise to this view. Her
                    cable of her meeting with Saddam reflected far more of what Saddam said to her
                    than what she said to Saddam. That is normal; that is the way you report
                    meetings. It's more important to Washington to know what the other person says
                    than what you say, because it is assumed that you are going to be faithful in
                    following your instructions. As I said earlier, in her case she didn't have any
                    instructions, but U.S. policy towards intra Arab border disputes from time
                    immemorial has been that “we do not take a position on the validity of either
                    side's claim, but what we do want is that these disputes be adjudicated through
                    diplomatic negotiations or through an international legal system.” That is what
                    she had repeated to Saddam. That was the U.S. position then; it was the U.S.
                    position before; it was the U.S. position afterwards. Even Tariq Aziz, in
                    perhaps one of his few truthful statements, has said that Saddam was not looking
                    for a green light, red light or yellow light; he didn't expect that from April
                    Glaspie, and that that had not been the purpose of the meeting. I've never
                    talked to Jim Baker about it. I've talked to Bob Kimmit about it. I think that
                    you can make the case that at a time when you are attempting to exercise global
                    leadership and build an international coalition, you cannot allow yourself to be
                    bogged down in the 'who lost Kuwait' debate. In the congressional inquiry, in
                    the press questions as to who lost Kuwait it would have made sense not to spend
                    all your time defending April Glaspie. Every time you say something in defense
                    of April Glaspie, you invite the next set of questions. At the end of the day an
                    ambassador gets paid big bucks to take some particular heat. I'm not sure that
                    that's what happened, but if I were Jim Baker, that's the way I would explain
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is pure supposition, but again, knowing something
                        about the topography of Washington, it sounded to me like the spinmeisters
                        around Jim Baker were pushing the anti Glaspie line, because Jim Baker was
                        not paying much attention. They, were trying to cover for their boss, and
                        the immediate rationale was that, the ambassador didn't handle it
                        right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's possible. I think they all sort of deluded themselves into maybe
                    thinking that was and then maybe came to believe it. In talking to Kimmit latehe
                    was the undersecretary for political affairs at the time and later went on to be
                    ambassador to Germanhe asked approximately the same questioi.e. why wasn't she
                    tougher on Saddam? The counter argument is what else was she going to say. Was
                    she going to tell Saddam, “If you invade Kuwait, we're going to bring B52s over
                    and bomb Baghdad back to the Stone Age.” You can't do that. You're under no
                    instructions to do that. It would have been going far beyond her brief to
                    represent the interests of your government. We have to remember that her meeting
                    with Saddam took place before the invasion. As I mentioned before, while she was
                    with Saddam, he took a phone call from Mubarak. In that conversation with
                    Mubarak, he told him exactly what he had told Aprii.e. that he would not do
                    anything militarily as long as there was a negotiating process ongoing and that
                    Mubarak need not worry. We were being told by all the Arab leaders in the
                    region, “Don't do anything because you might provoke exactly what you want to
                    avoid. We'll take care of it.” I think, if you're a country like the United
                    States, fundamentally you have to absorb the first blow. You can't put yourself
                    in a position where you're striking out first. You have to take the first blow.
                    In the case of Kuwait, we didn't take the first blow; the Kuwaitis took it, but
                    I think the point is that we could not have done much more than we did, which
                    was fly a couple of bomber aircraft around Bahrain for a couple days before the
                    invasion.</p>
                <p>As I said before, the larger question seems to mand I've discussed this with Mike
                    Van Heusen. Mike Van Heusen was the senior staffer for Lee Hamilton when
                    Hamilton was chairman of the whole House International Relations Committee. A
                    couple of days after April saw Saddam, Hamilton held a public hearing with John
                    Kelly, who was the assistant secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs,
                    as principal witness. Hamilton asked Kelland I remember this vividly because it
                    just jumped off the page and smacked me in the face when I first saw it in the
                    wireless fil“Do we have a mutual defense pact with Kuwait?” The question really
                    was whether an automatic response by the United States would be required by
                    treaty in the event that Kuwait was attacked? Hamilton knew the answer to that,
                    for crying out loud. It was his area of expertise. There's no reason for him to
                    ask that, particularly in open session, unless he wanted a public response.
                    Either they were really stupid in asking the question or they had reasons to
                    which I'm not privy, but he obviously got the answer that we had to give and
                    that was that we don't have a mutual defense pact with Kuwait. That opened up a
                    whole different set of issues. If you're going to come to the aid of a country
                    that's been invaded, you have to use a different set of legal justifications to
                    do so. So if you ever wanted to send a confusing signal to Saddam, when a senior
                    government official tells a senior member of the U.S. Congress that we didn't
                    have any legal requirement for the U.S. to come to the defense of Kuwait in the
                    event that Kuwait is invaded, that was it. That was the signal that you
                    send.</p>
                <p>Q: You haven't talked about the role of the Soviet embassy and Soviet supplies,
                    because this was a Soviet equipped army. Could you talk about your relationship
                    with the Soviet presence in Baghdad.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>WILSON: Our relationship with the Soviets during this period was remarkably good.
                    The Soviets had very good insights. Their ambassador and their DCM were both
                    very experienced hands. The ambassador had been DCM there before. The DCM was a
                    guy by the name of Kalugin whose father was the Kalugin of the KGB fame. We were
                    pretty close to theas close as you could be given that there was still some Cold
                    War rivalry. We used to see quite a bit of them. They had an awful lot of Soviet
                    technicians working in the south, which was going to be where the Iraqi troops
                    were as they moved into Kuwait and eventually a battlefield. They were running
                    power projects; there were a lot of technicians there and a lot of money
                    involved. The Soviets were owed a lot of money by the Iraqis for those services.
                    They had very real concerns about what was going to happen to their citizens in
                    south Iraq. They had to negotiate releases from their contract so that they
                    could bring their citizens out because the Iraqis weren't going to allow them to
                    go. The Iraqi position was that the Soviets were contractually obligated to stay
                    to finish the projects; they were not about to let them out of the contract. The
                    Soviets had a set of negotiations with the Iraqis on this issue. They had their
                    own reasons for the actions that they took throughout this period. The
                    connections between Gorbachev and Shevardnadze on the one hand and some of the
                    underlings on the other hand did not seem to work very well at times. In
                    particular, Primakov who later became the Russian foreign minister and had
                    ambition at one time, I think, to be president, seemed to play his own hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was prime minister, too...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was prime minister at one time. Primakov had been a close buddy of
                    Saddam's when he was in the KGB. He had been worked in that territory. He'd
                    known Saddam for 30 years. He got himself stuck into this situation and started
                    coming to Baghdad clearly trying to find a middle way. Every time Primakov would
                    come to Baghdad, we would end up having to have higher level talks with
                    Shevardnadzeither Baker Shevardnadze or Baker Gorbacheto try to rein in
                    Primakov. I remember one situation in particular. Primakov was in Baghdad. This
                    must have been in November, I guess; this was his second or third visit down
                    there. I would get read outs on the Primakov visit because we met with the
                    Soviets virtually every night which I would report. We had a standing meeting,
                    the Soviets, the French, the Turks and ourselves, at either the chief of mission
                    or deputy chief of mission level. It was open to all four. Primakov had come and
                    had met with Saddam and had made some public statement and gone away. This
                    public statement was far rosier than the circumstances merited, and we had
                    reported that. Frank Wisner, who was then our ambassador to Egypt, sent in a
                    companion report because he had met with the Soviet ambassador the following
                    day; he used one of his classic lines. He said, “The Soviet ambassador came and
                    briefed me about what Primakov and Saddam had discussed,” and he quoted the
                    ambassador as saying, “I was mildly encouraged by what I did not hear.” Then
                    Frank put in parenthesis, “Thin rule indeed.” It was a wonderful phrase which
                    supplemented what we were saying. This happened right about the time that
                    Shevardnadze was meeting with Baker in Paris, and literally within 24 hours of
                    Primakov's statement in Baghdad, Shevardnadze and Baker basically refuted and
                    discredited it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the Soviet ambassador or DCM, when he'd report on
                        Primakov, sort of roll their eyes and sort of say, “This is the son of a
                        bitch from out of town,” or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, they were far too disciplined to do that. They would report pretty
                    factually about what he was saying. They would not go into a lot of editorial
                    comment. They were most concerned that their interests be considered as we were
                    moving forward militarily. They were concerned about whether they were going to
                    get paid, but most importantly, I think, they were concerned about their several
                    thousands Soviet technicians who were in the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviet representatives there understand, when we
                        started putting in the 7th Corps and all, what was going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. I don't think they were under any illusions that a very real
                    possibility of military action existed and that we were buttressing our
                    diplomatic efforts with very real power and real force. I think that they and we
                    and everybody else who was in the diplomatic business labored intensively to try
                    to find a way by which we would have achieved our stated objectives without
                    having to resort to a prolonged military engagement. The Soviets had a lot at
                    stake. They had major investments in Iraq. They had a major political
                    relationship with Saddam. They had a lot of Soviet citizens there.</p>
                <p>From our side, we were staring the possibility of 20,000 casualties in the face.
                    It's not an exaggeration to say that we anticipated losing 20,000 American
                    citizens within a fouor five month period. That was a pretty heavy burden to be
                    contemplating. It therefore behooved all of us to insure, as we went into this,
                    that all other options had been tested and explored and found to be wanting
                    before we actually unleashed the military force. That was true ourselves, that
                    was true for the French and the Turks and everybody else who was some stakes in
                    the developments. At certain times resolution efforts became counterproductive
                    to the broader aims of the coalition. When UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar
                    came to Iraq, for example, on his 11th hour mission and when Mitterrand talked
                    about finding some other solution, that undermined to some extent what we were
                    trying to do, but by then it was too late in the game in any case.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>I mentioned that the Turks had the best intelligence network in Iraq. They had a
                    lot of commerce going back and forth; they had a lot of citizens in Iraq; they
                    had a lot of history with IraSo we spent a lot of time with the Turkish
                    ambassador, who was a very good friend, and his DCM, who was also a very good
                    friend. We met quite literally every night. The Turkish ambassador and I lived
                    within a mile of each other; so he and I and then most often the Soviet
                    ambassador or DCM and/or the French charg�, would meet to discuss the state of
                    affairs. It was clear to the Turks and us that, while the Iraqis intellectually
                    were concerned about U.S. military actioand I'm convinced that the reason that
                    Saddam first met with April on the 26th of July and then me on the 6th of
                    August, was because they wanted to blunt the possibility that we would react
                    unilaterallthey wanted the issue to be debated in the UN system. If there was
                    going to be a reaction, they wanted it to be a UN reaction because they thought
                    that a UN reaction meant protracted negotiations and toothless resolutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Perez de Cuellar seem to reflect this? Did you
                        consider him a help or a hindrance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He sent out Kokiana, and we thought that Koki was coming out to secure
                    the release of all hostages, but as it turned out that his mandate was to get
                    all UN workers out of Iraq, in which he was successful. That didn't endear him
                    to me, although I've since made my peace with him, or he's made his peace with
                    me, and we are fine with each other. But at the time, since the vast majority of
                    the UN employees were Palestinians who were traveling on Arab passports and were
                    therefore free to leave, I thought that for him to spent so much time on them
                    and so little time on other nationals was not very helpful. Clearly he was doing
                    it on behalf of Perez de Cuellar. When Perez de Cuellar finally did came out, it
                    was too late. I was already on the airplane on the way out. He literally landed
                    as we were leaving. What was being done in New York was something that Tom
                    Pickering was working on.</p>
                <p>

                        cover, was anybody coming out or could they come out? In other words,
                        somebody from Washington coming out and saying, “Is this guy Joe Wilson
                        solid or is he going around the bend,” or come out with instructions. Was
                        there any personal communication from the Department or thNSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>WILSON: We had a phone line set up 24 hours a day from the DCM's office where the
                    phone was located. I moved from the DCM's office into the ambassador's office
                    during that period, so that my old office could be vacated. We had some interns
                    basically monitoring the phones the whole time. Depending on the time and the
                    event, we would have various flurries of activity when we would be talking to
                    Washington on a regular basis; then there would be times when either most of
                    Washington was asleep or nothing was happening, but we would every 15 minutes we
                    would do a channel check. One time we were walking into ou8:30 or 9:00 o'clock
                    staff meeting. I remember this rather vividly; it was in Novembeand, the task
                    force voice came on the line and said to the person who was monitoring the
                    phone, “The balloon is going up,” and that was reported to me. So I went to the
                    phone and said, “I'm not sure I know what you mean. What do you mean the balloon
                    is going up?” The voice on the other end said, “Well, the Iraqis have just
                    launched an ICBM, or a missile, and we think its trajectory is going to have it
                    landing at Haifa or Tel Aviv.” I said, “Okay,” and we went to our staff meeting
                    to discussed this latest event. A military guy came in about 10 minutes late,
                    looked around the room, and said that he had never seen so many pale faces in
                    his life; we were trying to figure out what to do. We obviously activated all of
                    our security apparatus, i.e., our systems to alert people and get them places
                    where we could have a nose count and move them quickly if we had to. Then the
                    voice came on the phone again and said, “Whoops, false alarm.” The Iraqis were
                    apparently just testing their missiles and navigational systems; the missile
                    landed well within Iraqi territory, so we were able to stand down. But it was
                    one of those very interesting moments when, among other things, we were
                    considering whether or not to go upstairs on the roof of the embassy and check
                    the wind direction to figure out whether or not we were downwind or upwind from
                    the nuclear sites that they had.</p>
                <p>Q: I was talking a couple days ago to Bill Brown, who was our ambassador in Tel
                    Aviv at the time, about the situation. There's considerable worry about
                    biological and chemical warfare today in Washington. He was saying that he was
                    pretty sure that, if the Iraqis had fired one of their Scuds and if it had
                    landed near Tel Aviv with a chemical warhead, regardless whether it had been
                    effective, Baghdad within a half an hour would have been a nuclear waste site.
                    He was pretty sure that the Israelis were ready to launch a nuclear weapon in
                    retaliation.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>WILSON: There were a number of things we did to try to keep the Israelis from
                    going down that roaone of which was to give them the Patriot batteries. Two, we
                    sent Eagleburger to Jerusalem before Desert Storm to talk to them. Three, we
                    neglected to share with them any of our flight patterns or coordinates, so they
                    had no radio contact with U.S. airplanes and they would have been subjected to a
                    U.S. attack had they flown into Iraqi airspace, if they had they done so. I
                    think it was made very, very clear to them that this was not their war. Having
                    said that, I think that clearly had the chemical weapons landed in downtown Tel
                    Aviv or somewhere in Israel, I'm sure they would have felt obliged to react in
                    some fashion. One of the things we did do is when Baker met Tariq Aziz in
                    January 6th in Geneva, was to make very clear to Iraqwhich was couched in a
                    letter from Bush to Saddathat, if the Iraqis used weapons of mass destruction,
                    then the U.S. reserved the right to use every weapon in its arsenal in
                    retaliation. I think Baker made it quite unambiguous in that meeting that, if
                    the Iraqis used chemical weapons against us, we would obliterate them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to my original question: was it possible for somebody
                        from the NSC, from the State Department, to come to Baghdad and sound things
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were able to move some of our people across to Jordan as non
                    professional couriers, which we would do periodically. Our general services
                    officer needed a break; so we sent her to Jordan for three or four days as a non
                    pro couriethings like that. In terms of getting people in, the regional medical
                    officer came one time in November or December. I guess he was non pro couriered
                    in, which was a good thing because there were people among the Americans we were
                    keeping in diplomatic quarters who had not had their medication in a long time.
                    There were certain medical things that he could take care of, and that was very
                    helpful, I think, for all of us. That was about the only U.S. government
                    official who actually came into Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised, because I would have thought there would

                <p>WILSON: No. We were on the phone to them all the time. The regional medical

                    actually came to visit.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>WILSON: Women and children under the age of 18 had left. We had different
                    categories of people whom we were worried about. One, we had people who were in
                    hiding in Kuwait. Two, we had people who were within the embassy compound in
                    Kuwait, which had gotten down to just a handful of key personnel at that time.
                    We're now talking about the November time frame. Three, we had Americans in
                    hiding in diplomatic quarters in Baghdad. Those were the people who were at the
                    ambassador's residence, anywhere between 35 and 50 at any given time. Four, we
                    had the human shields, up to 115 at one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were not just Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: These were just American human shields. There were other human shields of
                    other nationalities. There were the French, there were Brits, there were
                    Japanese, and I think there may have been Germans. The Americans numbered 115.
                    Americans and the Brits were the last to be released. The Iraqis released the
                    French first. It's pretty clear to me that they did that because they hoped to
                    use that as an opportunity to drive a wedge between the Western countries that
                    were forming the coalition. I made it a point after that to be very open to the
                    French presin Frencto discuss with them how we saw things, in the hopes that the
                    French population would not forget that just because French were no longer being
                    held hostage, that didn't mean that there weren't other hostages. I think that
                    was reasonably successful. The French press covered it pretty well.</p>
                <p>Those were the categories of people that we were most concerned about. We had set
                    up our operations in Baghdad to service the two populations to whom we had some
                    access. One was the human shields where we worked through the foreign ministry
                    to get them mail. We produced the a weekly newspaper, with anodyne information
                    like football scores and things like that. That we would send out there in the
                    hopes that they would at least have something to read. We set up a pen pal
                    program so that every one of our 70 odd people who were working within the
                    embassy adopted a hostage or two and would serve as a funnel of information.
                    They would communicate with their families back in the States when they got a
                    letter. They would communicate with them when the family sent a letter to be
                    sent to them. And they would write once a week letters to them or something like
                    that. The other group was the people that we had in our housinanywhere from 35
                    to 50 people at the ambassador's residence at any one time. For these people we
                    had to worry about their medical conditions. We had one fellow who ran out of
                    his medicine. We worried about feeding and just taking care of them with the
                    necessities of life. I have mentioned that we set up a “scavenger” unit as we
                    called it, which went out and bought items on the local markets that had been
                    pillaged from Kuwait. They would spend every day at these wholesale markets
                    around Baghdad where these items from Kuwait were showing up.</p>

                <p>WILSON: No, in Baghdad there was no hostility shown towards Americans. I made a
                    point of having my flag on the car every time I went traveling around Baghdad,
                    even if it was just to and from work. I made a point of going to do my Christmas
                    shopping in the market. In fact, the press asked if they could come along, and
                    they did; so it was all photographed. There was never any hostility shown
                    towards me or any other American other than the government organized protests in
                    front of the embassy which would be staged every day to burn the flag and
                    effigy, and they would shout, “Down, down, Bush,” and “Down USA.” I mentioned
                    earlier that I had an arrangement with some of the media, the television cameras
                    in particular, that if they would not take any pictures of me, I would come out.
                    It usually happened about coffee break time, about 10:30 in the morning, and it
                    was be a good opportunity to just continue having a discussion with some of the
                    media, and it gave me a chance to take a cigar break. I would generally come out
                    and I sit on the bench behind the protestors and talk to the press while the
                    protests were going on in front of me, and smoke my cigar and just to take a
                    half hour to watch what was going on. That worked pretty well. They never
                    violated that confidence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the release of the hostages come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>WILSON: We saw that Saddam was going to use them as bait to lure Americans to
                    come to Iraq in an attempt to, I guess, really portray Kuwait as the aggrieved
                    party rather than the United States and to encourage them to violate the
                    Executive Order and the UN which had imposed sanctions on travel to Baghdad. It
                    was to a certain extent successful. We had a lot of visitors come through; the
                    most notable two being Mohamed Ali and Ramsey Clark, former attorney general in
                    the Johnson Administration. We made a practice of providing the Iraqis with
                    medical documentation for any hostage whose family was able to provide it to us.
                    Then we established criteria because the Iraqis would often ask us who should be
                    released and who shouldn't be released. We, of course, always said everybody
                    should be released, but in the absence of releasing everybody, “If you're going
                    to release three or four people,” we would name some based on a number of
                    objective criteria including health and age, state of mind, family status, etc.,
                    that we had established and we would forward those names accordingly. But at the
                    same time, we seized on the fact that they seemed to take medical status in
                    consideration when deciding which people were to be released. We encouraged
                    families to send us any sort of information on whatever malady their loved ones
                    might have suffered from infancy on; we would incorporate that into diplomatic
                    notes and send the information to the Iraqis. We would get letters saying, “My
                    husband once suffered from a hangnail,” and then we would send a diplomatic note
                    saying, “So and so once suffered from a hangnail. Therefore, he is obviously
                    medically unfit to be kept as a human shield, and you should release him.” We
                    inundated the Iraqi foreign ministry with these diplomatic notes. We also tried
                    to shame them at every opportunity. Let me go back to when they still were
                    holding women and children. I think I told this story. We made the point that
                    true Iraqi heroes did not hide behind the skirts of women and children. We did
                    something similar when hundreds of thousands of Indian and Pakistani and South
                    Asian workers in Kuwait were being herded into refugee camps and there was a
                    cholera outbreak. While they were in the refugee camps, Saddam was trying to
                    position himself as a champion of the Third World and a champion of the non
                    aligned movement and a champion of Islam. I went on CNN and said that this was
                    balderdash, given that you've that there were these tens of thousands of
                    citizens from Third World countries and from non aligned movement countries,
                    many thousands of whom were Muslim being held in refugee camps where they were
                    suffering from cholera. I said that one could see the epidemics that were
                    beginning to rage in these refugee camps since Saddam, their champion, was doing
                    nothing to allow them to leave. About three or four days later, he announced
                    that they could all leave. We had some almost immediate feedback with these
                    attacks on him; the confrontations with him were having some effect, so we did
                    that as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>In the “use of force” debate, David Jones, who had been an Air Force general and
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then Bill Crowe, who had been a Navy
                    admiral, and also had been Chairman, testified. Crowe's was particularly
                    important because he had been a Chairman under George Bush. Crowe said, “Give
                    sanctions a chance; don't use force,” We knew, because we had been doing a lot
                    of studies on the effects of sanctions, that sanctions were not going to do it;
                    they might be part of a broader strategy but they of themselves were not the
                    strategy. But the fact that a recently departed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff had testified in a way that was counter to his president's policy was
                    perceived by the Iraqis as a demonstration that the military would not be with
                    George Bush if he decided to launch his counterattack. As a consequence,
                    everything that we were doing towards getting the hostages released dried up
                    overnight. We were no longer solicited for our views on who should be the next
                    ones to go. We were never solicited for our views on who should stay because we
                    always refused to answer, but on who should go, what our priority was, who might
                    be the four or five that we would think were probably the neediest and who
                    should leave with the next American visitor. I must say that I have never really
                    forgiven either of those gentlemen but in particularly Admiral Crowe for having
                    said what he did say. I thought that it was not well thought out. He didn't have
                    access to the information that he needed to allow him to draw the conclusions he
                    drew in front of the U.S. Senate committee; the signal that he sent to the
                    Iraqis was unmistakable and it was very much an anathema to what we were trying
                    to achieve. That was a setback. Notwithstanding that, we were successful in
                    getting everybody out of there. In fact, if you go back and you take a look at
                    the history, of the several thousand Americans who were at risk during that
                    period, we lost just two, one of whom was a U.S. government employee. He was one
                    of our communicators who died of a cerebral hemorrhage the first or second night
                    of the invasion. The other was an American who was swept up in the invasion, and
                    while he was in custody in the first couple days he had a heart attack and died.
                    Everybody else made it out and back to their loved ones by Christmas.</p>

                        certain point you have to say, “Oh yes, and we have 2,000 people in Kuwait
                        who'd like to get out too.” How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>WILSON; The Iraqis knew that there were a number of people hiding in Kuwait. They
                    didn't know how many, and we weren't going to tell them. We had an interesting
                    experience where the German ambassadowe were not the only ones who had citizens
                    in hiding; other Europeans had citizens in hiding as welat one point called the
                    Japanese ambassador, the French charg�, the British ambassador and me to invite
                    us over to his office. He told u“I've just negotiated a deal with the Iraqis on
                    behalf of all of us,” although nobody had empowered him to negotiate on our
                    behalf. The deal was as follows: The Iraqis had committed to the German
                    ambassador that they would permit all of our nationals in hiding in Kuwait safe
                    passage out of Kuwait City. That sounded really nice. I raised my hand and said,
                    “That sounds very nice, but is this safe passage all the way out of Iraq or is
                    it just out of Kuwait?.” We'd had this experience already with the Iraqis double
                    crossing us on people coming from our compound in Kuwait. He said, “It's from
                    Kuwait. They will organize it, they will provide the safe passage, they will
                    take care that nothing happens to them, and when they get to Baghdad, they'll be
                    human shields. But clearly their fate as human shields will be better than what
                    they're going through in hiding as fugitives in Kuwait.” I said, “Well, thanks
                    very much. I have to tell you in all candor that I really am not sure that my
                    government would support anything like that, however humanitarian it may seen on
                    the face of it, just because I don't think that we're going to support anything
                    that puts more of our citizens under Saddam's thumb.” I went back and I wrote
                    the cable to Washington. Of course, I was far more candid in my cable to
                    Washington than I was to the German. I said that this didn't make a lot of sense
                    to me, that, however well intentioned it might be. The idea of having more
                    people as human shields didn't seem to be something that we would want to
                    supporthe U.S. government would not want to go on record as suggesting to
                    American citizens that they come out of hiding to be made hostages. The
                    Department agreed with me. The next day they sent Ambassador General Vernon
                    Walters to see the German foreign minister, who at that time was Genscher, to
                    read him the riot act about presuming to be acting on our behalf particularly on
                    what was really a cockamamie idea. So we didn't obviously participate. We ran a
                    number of charter flights in and out of Kuwait. Every time that we thought that
                    we had enough eligible people to justify a flight, we would run a flight to and
                    from Kuwait.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a the medical type?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was a flight designed to move people out who were eligible. There were
                    still American women in Kuwait; we had Americans who were of dual parentage and
                    therefore had dual citizenship. In those cases we insisted that they were
                    Kuwaiti. So we offered a number of Americans the opportunity to come to the
                    Kuwait airport and get on an aircraft flying out of the area. I think we flew
                    something in the order of 11 or 12 flights. Typically if we had a group in Iraq
                    that was ready, then we would bring the aircraft to Baghdad, fill it up and send
                    it on its way. Typically there were never had enough Americans on these flights,
                    so we would invite people of other nationalities to get aboard a first
                    come/first served basis. If you took a look at the manifests, we had Libyans, we
                    had Filipino maids, we had Palestinianwe had all sorts of nationalities on these
                    flights out of there and very few Americans. If I were to go back and calculate
                    how many Americans actually got out from August 2nd on, I think the number from
                    Kuwait would number far less than 2,000, but I think all Americans, certainly
                    all Americans who wanted to leave and could leave, got out.</p>

                <p>WILSON: We had two categorieI'll leave Kuwait aside when I talk about this. We
                    can talk about Kuwait later. Within Iraq we had two categories. We had a few of
                    these kids who had been born of Iraqi fathers and American mothers in the States
                    and the Iraqi father, after splitting with the American mother, had somehow
                    gotten his hands on the kids and brought them back to Iraq. There was nothing we
                    could do about that even thougI used to spend hours working on such problems. I
                    actually met the father of a couple of these kids. We made innumerable
                    representations on behalf of these kids who were American citizens, but in Iraqi
                    law, were the sons and daughters of Iraqi citizens and, therefore, they were
                    Iraqis and unable to leave Iraq. We did everything we could to facilitate
                    contact between the mother and the father to assure the mother that her kids
                    were okay and to try to facilitate some rapprochement which would allow the
                    mother to see the children periodically. That was one category, which at no
                    level could we bridge the gap. The other category was the one you
                    mentionetypically American women who had married Iraqis, mostly in the '40s or
                    the '50s when the first wave of Iraqis had come to the United States to go to
                    school. These were people of late middle age who had spent most of the last 40
                    years in Iraq, including the whole period of the Gulf War, without ever having
                    the opportunity to leave because there were restrictions on Iraqi travel outside
                    the country during that period. They had basically decided their own fate by
                    that time. They saw themselves as the wives of Iraqis. None of them approached
                    me about leaving. Their whole relationship with the American embassy was one of
                    just staying in touch with America and their American roots, but for all intents
                    and purposes they all saw themselves as Iraqis. In another category, we had a
                    fellow who was in hiding in Baghdad. He would pop up from time to time. He was
                    an employee of an American firm. He did not stay at the embassy compound because
                    he had a girlfriend, and he opted to marry the girl and stay in Baghdad; he
                    didn't want to leave. These were the only ones that I'm aware of. Those were the
                    categories and those were really the cases that we could not help them to get
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In Kuwait, we did manage to run a couple of flights filled with women and
                    children who had the dual national citizenship. The dual national case occurred
                    usually in two ways. One was the children of an American male and a Kuwaiti
                    female; they were Americans, and that was pretty easily resolved; they were able
                    to leave. Then the second one were the offspring of American mothers and Kuwaiti
                    fathers. The initial decision was that they were to be considered Kuwaitis
                    through their father and, therefore, the mothers would be permitted to leave
                    without her the children because all Kuwaitis had become Iraqis and therefore
                    were subject to the travel restrictions imposed on Iraqis. A number of such
                    cases had gotten on the airplane in Kuwait and showed up in Baghdad for
                    processing. We had a processing center there. The Iraqis had a processing
                    center, so people would fly from Kuwait to Iraq, be processed, get back on the
                    airplane and fly to Europe. In this casI was always at the airport when they
                    came througthe Iraqis were saying, “We're not going to let these people leave.”
                    I went into the head of the Immigration office and I told him that I was furious
                    at what they were doing. I had my biggest cigar in my mouth and I had my face
                    really right up in his facjust far enough away from his face so that I could
                    smoke my cigar. Every time I was getting in his face, I was blowing cigar smoke
                    in his face as well. I made it very clear to him that we were not going to put
                    up with the idea of separating mothers and children. I got Nezar Hamdun on the
                    phone, and he laid out the rationale that I have just mentioned. My rejoinder
                    was that not just Iraqi custom but even under the Islamic faith, one would not
                    separate a mother from her young children. As a consequence it seemed to me that
                    he could use that as the rationale for letting these children leave with their
                    mothers. I said that in any event we were just not going to permit this to
                    happen if we could possibly stop it. I told Nezar, “Look, this is the way you
                    get out of the problem. These are children of American mothers. While
                    technically they're Kuwaiti children, the general principle of not separating
                    mothers from their children should be overriding in this case.” I added, “And if
                    you don't, I just want you to know that your president made the decision to
                    allow women and children to leave Iraq because he thought he was going to gain
                    propaganda points through this decision. He thought that the world would see him
                    in a kinder, gentler fashion. Now, right outside this door are television crews
                    from CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN, and if I don't have satisfactory resolution of this
                    problem within 30 minutes, when it is the time that the plane is supposed to
                    take off, and if these people are not on that plane, then I will have no choice
                    but to go out there and report to the world's media that the instructions of
                    Saddam Hussein to allow women and children to leave were not carried out by his
                    underlings out here at the airport or in the foreign ministrThe decision is
                    yours.” Twenty eight minutes later he called me back and said, “They can all go.
                    Put the Immigration official on the phone.” The Immigration official got on the
                    phone, said, “Yes, Sir,” and they moved all the women and children onto the
                    airplane and they got out. After that, I went out; the press was all there and
                    they asked me about it, and I was able to report that in fact there had been a
                    successful departure of all these women and children.</p>

                        where it really hit the world, and that was particularly true for CNN but
                        also for other television networks. The media became a very important tool
                        of diplomacy. It could be used for you or against you. It was a
                        watershed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was particularly interesting in Iraq because the embassy had the only
                    technical means for the reporters to file their reports without having to the
                    Morse code telegraph system or some other outdated system. Fax machines were
                    outlawed. They could communicate through an Iraqi operator and be connected, but
                    whatever they were going to report would be listened to. They would have to then
                    dictate the report, or they could come down to the embassy and the compound
                    across the street which we occupied. Those were useless offices anyway, being
                    occupied by USIS; so we had turned them into a press filing center. Our PAO had
                    set it up in a way to provide everybody their own desk and their own telephone
                    lines, all of which were connected to Washington; they were direct dial capable.
                    We were the only place in Baghdad that had direct dial capability. The reporters
                    would come in the afternoon and file their stories. Even in those days, one
                    could take his or hers little laptop computer and hook it up through the modem
                    that one could file the stories electronically. They could do it very, very
                    quickly. It put the reporters in an interesting position. They wanted to file
                    their stories, but they also didn't want to be perceived as being too close to
                    the American embassy. We made no specific demands on them at all. What we did do
                    was to hold a morning press briefing which was on background. Before that press
                    briefing, we would hold our staff meeting in part to determine what the message
                    of the day would be. We would determine what it was we hoped the press would
                    cover in Baghdad from our perspective. So during the course of the press
                    backgrounder, we would try to invite their attention to issues that were of
                    great concern to us, and typically we would get some stories written about it.
                    The press loved the opportunity to take pictures of me getting into the car; so
                    we would give them those opportunities. Did I tell you the story about

                <p>WILSON: They had satellite hook up, so they were able to bring their equipment

                    a rooftop to put it on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The Iraqi on the street would never see it, because all dissemination of
                    information was restricted; there were no satellite dishes allowed in Iraqi and,
                    of course, the press was subject to enormous censorship. The only people that
                    really saw foreign media coverage were the Iraqi elite, basically Saddam and his
                    information ministry, which was charged with monitoring the coverage, and his
                    foreign ministry for much the same reason, and perhaps parts of his inner
                    circle. The number of people who actually saw the coverage was very small. The
                    importance of the people who saw it was tremendous. I could tell who was
                    watching it by who was pissed off at me on any given day, because I used every
                    opportunity to go on and make really derogatory comments about Saddam. I was
                    even called over to the foreign ministry one time and chastised for my
                    aggressive and assertive behavior, to which I rejoined that when one had 117 of
                    his citizens being held hostage, they could damn well expect that we're going to
                    be assertive and aggressive on their behalf.</p>

                    have anybody else to talk to. They kicked everybody else out. They kicked out
                    our military attach�, our station chief, and our consular officer.</p>

                <p>WILSON: These were kids who had come over to spend their summer to work in the
                    embassy. We had a couple who had just arrived and we had a bunch from Kuwait. I
                    think we had four altogether, kids who were either in their senior year or in
                    the first year of graduate school. They came to Baghdad and they were terrific.
                    They just went with the flow. For them, this was just a great experience. They
                    manned the telephones. They did that 24 hours a day. They worked on six hour
                    shifts. I would spend a lot of time with them, because they were in my old
                    office. We took the approach to be just as open as we could be with everybody in
                    our community. We had nothing to hide. There were maybe some things we wouldn't
                    discuss openly with people, but most everything was open to discussion. I tried
                    to make myself very accessible to anybody. So I spent a lot of time with these
                    kids, and it was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sort of distress on the part of the State
                        Department of having interns there: parents saying “Come home, get them out
                        of harm's way” and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Oh, yes, absolutellots of distress. But we fostered an atmosphere of
                    defiance within our embassy. We took a look at some of the other models of
                    people in hostage like situations; the ones that we had looked at were not
                    terribly appealing in our own thinking to how we wanted to approach this issue.
                    We did not want to be seen as whining about why isn't our government doing more
                    for us. So we attempted to create an atmosphere of real defiance. The British
                    ambassador one time accused me of acting like a cowboy sitting on my stoop with
                    my shotgun across my knee waiting for the bad guys to come over the horizon. He
                    meant that in the way only a British could mean it, which is really somewhat
                    critical. I took it, and my staff took it, as a supreme compliment.</p>

                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>WILSON: A lot of them were constrained by their commitments to the EU. In the EU
                    system, there's a requirement to achieve consensus. So even though we had
                    somewhat different ways of getting to the common objective, we all were pretty
                    much on the same page. It was very clear that the country that was going to lead
                    in this particular situation was the United States. We were the ones who were
                    being paid to be the most belligerent. If there was somebody who was going to
                    find a meeting of the minds that would accommodate both the U.S. position, as
                    characterized by our president, and the Iraqi position, which was characterized
                    by their presence in Kuwait City, it would have to be a third party. We were not
                    going to be the ones who were going to be making any concessions whatsoever. We
                    understood early on that in Saddam's world a concession would be pocketed, and
                    viewed as a sign of weakness, and that the Iraqis would then move on to seek the
                    next concession. We were not going to give them the satisfaction of any
                    concessions whatsoever. The French were pretty good on the ground. In fact, the
                    French charg� who was there when I was there is now back there as the head of
                    their interest sectionow ten years later. We had very similar views on where
                    this situation was going and how it was going. I said that we had nightly
                    meetingthe French, the Soviets, ourselves, and the Turks, during which we would
                    discuss the events of the day and how we thought that we might get from here to
                    there. The Brits were invited to a lot of these meetings as well. The British
                    ambassador found us insufferable, but that's not surprising. He found us
                    particularly insufferable because we offered sanctuary to all our nationals, and
                    as a consequence he was pretty much obliged to do so the same because, after
                    all, if the Americans could do it, why couldn't the British? So he offered his
                    nationals sanctuary on their embassy property in tents, and then they had to
                    call us for things like washing machines and dishwashers and televisions and
                    some of the luxuries that they needed really to take care of a population that
                    size. They didn't like that very much at all. We, of course, loved it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, I'd say so. I don't know how he would have done it differently and
                    ultimately where they would have come down, but we were clearly the more
                    strident. I think that he was actually out of step with his own government in a
                    lot of these issues. But because we were doing things for our citizens, some of
                    these other countries felt compelled to do similar things for theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The hostages had left by when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Early December, shortly after Thanksgiving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our embassy in Kuwait: I think you mentioned it before,
                        but when did that move to Baghdad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>WILSON: The first part of the embassy moved in late Augus110 to 120 staffers
                    probably moved in late August; and the rest of them moved about the time that
                    the hostages were released. I think there was some linkage between their leaving
                    and the hostages leavinin fact, I know there was. They were permitted to stand
                    down; we withdrew our diplomatic representation from Kuwaiwe temporarily left
                    Kuwait, left the flag flying but took out all our personnel. After the hostages
                    had been released, the rationale was that, since there were no longer any
                    American citizens in Kuwait who wanted to leave or needed any embassy or
                    consular services, there was therefore no longer any reason to keep our staff
                    there under the circumstances; so they left. This was in the early December time
                    frame, sometime between the 3rd and the 10th or 11th.</p>

                        who worked in our embassies both in Kuwait and in Baghdad? Were they taken
                        care of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. I don't know about Kuwait, because we never went there and never
                    provided any administrative support to them. In the case of Baghdad, they all
                    stayed with us, even though many of them were being advised by their families
                    that they ought to leave for their own safety. Some may have been harassed by
                    their neighbors; they were all as uncertain or even more uncertain of their
                    future than we were; they were under as great or greater stress than we were,
                    and yet they stayed with us. My driver, who was an Egyptian, to whom I had said
                    early on that if he felt more comfortable leaving, he should do so taking into
                    account his own personal considerations, but he didn't do it. He was under
                    tremendous stress. He was a very nervous guy anyway.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any way one could compensate them for this loyalty, then or later
                    on?</p>
                <p>WILSON: I don't think there was any way of adequately compensating them. I think
                    we made some efforts to get them some legal status in the United States. But I
                    don't know where all that went.</p>

                <p>WILSON: No, because the Iraqis themselves had imposed travel restrictions; so
                    Iraqis could not get out. They couldn't get passports.</p>

                    Iraq during the Gulf War. Our contact with the Iraqi elite was very limited. We
                    knew a few people who managed some of the establishments around town and a few
                    professors at the university, but we tried to avoid our best friends during
                    these times of stress because they would been watched as closely or more closely
                    than anybody, and their contacts with Americans would put them at some risk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we get into December, the hostages are gone...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I should mention that a number of hostages got themselves out. We had a
                    number of hostagethey were not actually hostages but housed in different
                    quarterwho took it upon themselves to make a break for it. We counseled them not
                    to do it; it was dangerous, but they were committed to doing so. Since we had no
                    legal means of keeping them against their will, all we could do was counsel them
                    not to proceed, but then we provided as much support as we could, including
                    maps, compasses and such. A number of these peoplmaybe as many as three or four
                    different groups over a period of three weekleft in the middle of the night and
                    drove as far towards the Jordanian border as they coulusually within a couple of
                    miles of the border. I don't know how they got through the checkpoints, but they
                    did. They drove all the way to near the Jordanian border, walked a couple miles
                    in the desert, turned towards the Jordanian border at some point, and then
                    crossed the rest of desert into Jordan, where they would be met by American
                    authorities on the other side. Although we didn't run these operations, we
                    provided logistic support to those who determined that they were going to do so
                    whether we liked it or not, and we didn't like it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. By mid December, we were looking at Christmas. There were about five
                    of us left in the embassy plus all the journalists we had therCNN and everybody
                    was still there. All the hostages were gone. We had a general services officer,
                    a communicator, a secretary, and myselthat was probably it, four of us, I guess,
                    maybe five. Maybe we had a fifth one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had made the decision to fight; that was well apparent.
                        What were you getting from the Iraqi side, just monitoring whatever you
                        could? Did they understand what was happening by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>WILSON: A couple things happened. One, the president had indicated a willingness
                    to go the extra mile, which, curiously enough, was perceived by the Iraqis as a
                    concession and as a sign of weakness. Therefore they attempted to negotiate the
                    offer to go the extra mile. The initial offer was 'we'll send Jim Baker to
                    Baghdad and you can have Tariq Aziz come to Washington and we will have these
                    two meetings just to make sure that every avenue for a diplomatic solution has
                    been explored before we actually have to go to war.' The Iraqis said, “Nah,
                    that's a unilateral proposal. It wasn't proposed after any discussions with us.
                    It wasn't agreed upon. We don't agree with it.” But we finally settled on a
                    meeting in Geneva. But during the month of December, in fact for several months
                    prior to that, I had been arguing that we needed to produce a tape. I may have
                    told you this story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You told a story about the military...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: And Wayne Downing, and we were producing it. We felt that it was really
                    very important that the Iraqi military high command understand that this war was
                    not going to be prosecuted the way the Iran Iraq War was, and the way to do that
                    was to give them a good show of the various weapon systems that we were prepared
                    to bring to bear on them. That was distributed in December, although I don't
                    know how good the distribution was, but by that time I think it was too late
                    anyway. I think ultimately, if you had looked at the situation as a poker game,
                    Saddam had his bluff called in November when the president moved the 7th Corps
                    to the Saudi desert. Even though his bluff had been called, he kept raising the
                    stakes. So by the time the middle of December rolled around, everybody was
                    pretty fatalistic about what's would happen. The Iraqi street was pretty
                    fatalistic.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>We believed that everything diplomatic ought to be done that could be done. We
                    had this exchange of historical references: War is a failure of diplomacy versus
                    war is just diplomacy by another means, and which camp did you fall into? I had
                    said that, from my perspective as a diplomat in the field, we would continue to
                    pursue diplomatic ends thinking that war resulted from a failure of diplomacy.
                    Eagleburger had come out and said war really was an extension of diplomacy and
                    politics by another name. So we had the debate on where we were going to end up
                    and ended up in Geneva in January. At the same time we're trying to come up with
                    ways that would allow us to achieve our objectives without having to run the
                    risk of the 20,000 casualties that we were being foreseen. Remember, that at the
                    time all the East Coast hospitals were bringing in extra supplies of blood and
                    extra beds. We had the Dover Air Force base, which is the national military
                    mortuary, being set up to handle all these casualties. We're looking at a big
                    war. We have 500,000 troops. The Pentagon and the political powers were
                    predictin20,000 or 30,000 casualties in an engagement of this size. We had the
                    7th Corps, which is the corps that was instrumental in winning the Second World
                    War in Europe, in the desert, etc. So we said, “Look, at this stage, it strikes
                    us that Saddam has already seen his move as a political victory even if he
                    suffers a military defeat. We don't think he's going to back down, but if there
                    is a way for him to back out and save face and if we decide that it's in our
                    interest to have him back out and save face, then we ought to consider a number
                    of things.” For one, we said, “Quit demonizing him. Quit calling him the second
                    coming of Adolph Hitler, because you make it just way too personal when you do
                    that; two, even though this is not clearly an invasion of Kuwait to liberate
                    Palestine, we need to find an occasion to rededicate ourselves to the
                    Palestinian question and Arab/Israeli issues, in the aftermath of this side show
                    that Saddam created; three, one of the great incentives we can hold out to him
                    is that if he withdraws voluntarily from Kuwaii.e. isn't driven out of Kuwaihe
                    essentially keeps his army intact. We proposed these tactics, and lo and behold,
                    Jim Baker went on “Meet the Press” a couple days later and used them all. Saddam
                    didn't pick up on any of them, not surprisingly since he just really hadn't
                    understood or hadn't wanted to see the situation in the same way that we saw it.
                    To this day I'm convinced that he saw this engagement probably very much as
                    Nasser and later Sadat saw the engagements with the Israelis in the wars of 1967
                    and 1971; that is to say that a military defeat could become a political victory
                    because an Arab had shown enough mettle to stand up to the West. So even if he
                    hadn't defeated us, he would have gained stature in the eyes of the Arab people
                    because he had shown the courage to stand up to WesI think ultimately that was
                    Saddam's view.</p>
                <p>Q: You were pretty well occupied with your current challenges, but was there any
                    thinking by you or by other diplomatic colleagues from other embassies asking,
                    “What if Saddam suffers a real military defeat, a real collapse of his army,
                    whither Iraq, looking towards another type of government or looking for its
                    successes?</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>WILSON: No, that was not what we were doing in Baghdad at the time. We had not
                    looked at a scenario for the collapse of the Iraqi regime or an alternatives
                    solution to Saddam's rule. If in retrospect, you look at the situation and ask
                    the question of why didn't we go all the way to Baghdad at the time, then that
                    question really rises or as it's been phrased more commonly, “Why did you let
                    Saddam stay in place?” The answer really is that the coalition was blessed by
                    the UN Security Council. It was the first time that the Security Council had
                    sanctioned this type of military engagement since the Korean War. It was
                    important in the context of the vision of future wars to have an international
                    legal basis and sanctions and support and a war being fought by a coalition
                    under the auspices of the UN Security Council. It was really important that the
                    first time out of the chute since the Korean War to abide by the Security
                    Council resolutions. Therefore it was important to expel Iraqis from Kuwait, but
                    not route follow them all the way up to Baghdad and to throw Saddam out. The
                    coalition's actions were going to be limited to the expulsion of the Iraqis from
                    Kuwait.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>I think people who looked at Desert Storm will tell you that a lot of Saddam's
                    Republican Guard, his core forces, had left Kuwait before the invasion took
                    place, so that he had actually managed to save a good part really elite forces.
                    We didn't go into Iraq because it would have violated the UN Security Council
                    resolution. It was also pretty clear that our Arab allies in this confrontation,
                    while understanding the rationale for getting Saddam out of Kuwait, foresaw a
                    worst nightmare and that waand probably always will ba Western power acting to
                    overthrow an Arab government just because it didn't like it, thereby inflicting
                    severe humiliation on the Arab world. Had we gone further than the Kuwait Iraqi
                    border, we could have easily stimulated disaffection among our Arab allies
                    almost immediately, whether they were the Saudiprobably not the Saudibut
                    certainly the Egyptians and the Syrians. Thirdly, had we gone into Baghdad, one
                    of two things would have happened. Either you would have had a continuation of
                    the pictures we had been taken during the first couple days after we got into
                    Kuwait CitU.S. troops riding along the “ road of death”pictures of a lot of dead
                    Iraqis and a lot of carnage brought by our air attacks and our artillery
                    attacks. You either would have had those sorts of pictures being published
                    running the risk of public opinion changing rather dramatically or, the closer
                    the coalition forces got to Baghdad, the more the world might have seen the
                    Iraqis defending their homeland. Their defense would have been much more
                    spirited than it had been in defense of their occupation of Kuwait causing a
                    much high numbers of casualties on our side for something that was clearly not
                    one of our objectives at the time we launched our military actions. Finally once
                    we got to Baghdad, we wouldn't have found Saddam and we would have been stuck
                    with administering a really fractious societnone of whom probably wanted you to
                    be there. It would have been a real mess. I think we've proven that we're much
                    better at winning wars than we are at occupying foreign lands. Fifthly, which is
                    one that comes up as much in hindsight as it ever did at the time we gamed this
                    out, had we gotten rid of Saddam and had we completely destroyed his military,
                    we would have created had a vacuum and an opportunity for Iranian mischief
                    making. As the Iraqis would tell you, the Iranians have been trying to redraw
                    the border between Iran and the Arab world for 150 years. So I think in
                    retrospect you can make the argument that it was not in our interest to have an
                    Iraq so weakened that it fell prey to an Iranian assault, which could have
                    happened.</p>

                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>I sent off one last bit of advice to the president and the secretary of state.
                    This was right before Christmas. It was no brilliant insight on my part, but one
                    of my informal political advisors, which is to say the mediin this case it was
                    an American journalist for the London Sunday Timecame to see me. Marie Colvin is
                    her name. She was probably one of the best writers on the Middle East. She had
                    spent years in and around the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and has been involved
                    in every major Middle East crisis for 25 years. This is part of our relationship
                    with the press. We'd send them out; we'd give them our message and then when
                    they would come back to the USIS building to file their stories. I would wander
                    over to the filing center in the late afternoon just to sit around and chat with
                    the press and glean from them what they had learned during the day. The press,
                    which is very good at asking questions, is also very open about what it found.
                    They were always seeking some feedback, some validation of what they were about
                    to write. Anytime they could get an additional quote, they would add it to their
                    story.</p>
                <p>When I think of all the things we did, mastering the art of dealing with the
                    press was one of our better efforts. In any case, Marie came to see me and said,
                    “You know, I've got to tell you that in Baghdad, out there on the street, and
                    with Iraqi authorities, they think that you guys are bluffing.” I said, “How can
                    they think that? We've got 500,000 soldiers in the desert, and we've got Norm
                    Schwarzkopf out there, Stormin' Norman.” She said, “Well, it's because every
                    time the president of the United States and the secretary of state open their
                    mouths, they talk about bringing war to Saddam and Iraq, but they think you're
                    bluffing. If you really want them to take you seriously, they ought to just shut
                    up. You don't need to say this anymore.” I thought about it and I concluded that
                    her advice sounded like a good idea. It was true. The war drums were beating so
                    loud that one just had to wonder whether they were so loud because we didn't
                    intend to do anything and just hoped that by beating the drums we would get the
                    Iraqis to leave Kuwait. Saddam had his theory that the United States was
                    temperamentally incapable of spilling the blood of 10,000 soldiers in the
                    Arabian Desera direct quote to mor had the staying power to remain in the desert
                    for the time that it would take to end such a war. So I wrote a cable to the
                    president and the secretary saying, “If you want Saddam to take us seriously,
                    shut up”a little bit more elegant than that, but that was the basic message.
                    This friend of mine, Larry Drawl, who was in the Secretariat at the time, he's
                    the one who actually...</p>

                <p>WILSON: State Department Secretariat. He actually picked up the cable and hand
                    carried it to the secretary of state. He was the senior watch officer running
                    the Secretariat. He said that he read the cable on the way down to the
                    secretary's office and thought that I'd gone off my rocker, because one did not
                    address cables like these to the president of the United States or the secretary
                    of state. He said that he took my message to the secretary; three days later he
                    opened his newspapers and was struck that in the American press at that time
                    there was nothing, no quote, from the president of the United States or the
                    secretary of state or any other Executive Branch official on what we were going
                    to do to Iraq. He said that “Then I realized that you were a genius.” By that
                    time, unfortunately everybody elsevery pundit, every retired military officer,
                    anybody who could find a microphone, every member of Congreswas rushing to the
                    microphones to fill the void. So the silence from the policy makers was lost on
                    most people, and if it was lost on most people, it was probably lost on Saddam.
                    But I think it was still an effective tactic and one that I still sometimes
                    advise governments, if they're going to war, to quit beating the war drums.</p>
                <p>We spent this very quiet Christmas in Baghdad waiting for the other shoe to drop,
                    waiting for either Baker to come or Tariq to go or the meeting to take place in
                    Geneva, which was what ultimately happened. The negotiations there went on very
                    late into December.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the problem of exchange of visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The problem was that the meeting was something that had been foisted upon
                    the Iraqis. They had been told to have it rather than ask for it. They wanted an
                    opportunity to negotiate even that. In fact, when Bush made his statement “I
                    want to go the extra mile,” my reaction and the reaction of some people out of
                    Baghdad was that the Iraqis were going to read that as “the bazaar is open”the
                    negotiations have now opened. They didn't see a meeting as one last chance to
                    explain to them precisely what was going to happebefore it happened. They saw it
                    really as the first step in a negotiated departure, which from their perspective
                    would take as long as it has taken the Israelis to leave Gaza and the West Bank
                    except that Kuwait was a much more lucrative piece of real estate.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>It was clear to me that the Iraqis were going to move towards a referendum, after
                    they had populated Kuwait with Iraqis which would decide the outcome. We got
                    through Christmas and New Year's. On New Year's there was a party at, I think,
                    the French charg�'s house. He had this New Year's Eve party. I wasn't going to
                    go because I felt that it was absolutely inappropriate on the eve of a major
                    military conflict for me to be out partying in downtown Baghdad in any way
                    whatsoever. But somebody prevailed upon me. It was actually the correspondent
                    from the New York Times. I said, “I will go only because it's just a way of
                    showing respect to those who were hosting it. I don't want to be seen to be
                    boycotting this affair, but I'll go only if you promise that my attendance there
                    is strictly off the record.” In her book on the Gulf War, it's the first or
                    second paragraph of the introduction or chapter one in which she said that the
                    American charg� danced the night away. I went, I spent about 20 minutes, then I
                    left; yet it still showed up in the book. That is something that has always
                    irked me, but nonetheless, there it is.</p>
                <p>During the first week of January we basically just waited. On January 6th the
                    meeting between Baker and Aziz took place. Jim Baker told me afterwards that at
                    the meeting he had four agenda points. One of them was securing Iraqi permission
                    for the withdrawal of American diplomatic representation and American diplomats
                    when and if the United States made that decision. He said that four times he
                    raised that with Tariq Aziz and four times Tariq said, “I have to refer that to
                    higher authorities” higher authorities being Saddam. Of the other issues that
                    were on the table, the only other one that I remember offhanI know that letter
                    has been published sincwas telling Saddam that, if they use weapons of mass
                    destruction, all U.S. military options would be available for use. I think that
                    was really important. If you ever want to raise a possibility to insure that
                    ultimately a government, even a government like Saddam, was going to make
                    rational decisions, that was one. The only way that they had of possibly
                    stemming the tide against 500,000 American soldiers on the ground in the desert
                    would have been to use exotic weapon; the fact that they didn't do that, I
                    think, is indicative of their concern that they would be obliterated had they
                    done so. When we talk about national missile defense and things like that, the
                    presumption that we make is that government like North Korea might actually be
                    tempted into using those kinds of weapons. Our position makes the risks quite
                    clear.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>They had the meeting on the sixth. We heard nothing. On the ninth I got a phone
                    call from Nezar Hamdun, the undersecretary at the ministry of foreign affairs.
                    He had formerly been head of the Interest Section in Washington and then later
                    was the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations. He said higher authorities have
                    confirmed that, “Should you decide to withdraw your diplomatic representation,
                    you can do so. We pose no objections.” I phoned Washington, and Washington
                    replied, “Well, that's fine. Why don't you get on an airplane?” There were will
                    airplanes going back and forth to Ammaor drive to Amman, one or the other. Get
                    on an airplane to Amman and get on a commercial flight out of Jordan.” This is
                    the 10th of January when we were talking. I said, “Well, that's very thoughtful
                    of you.” We had run several these charter flights to Europe taking everybody and
                    their uncle and their dogs and maids and everybody else, but for they were going
                    to have us fly to Amman, Jordan, and then wait around for a commercial flight. I
                    made the rather flip comment, “I suppose we'll be flying economy class, but do
                    you think we can at least get the 20 extra pounds of air freight for
                    international flights?” The rejoinder was, “I think that can be arranged.” After
                    stewing about that conversation for about five minutes, I called back to a
                    somewhat higher level in the State Department with a suggestion. I said, “It
                    doesn't make any sense because the Jordanians have already said that if and when
                    hostilities break out, they're going to close the airport. There are already 300
                    Americans at the Amman International Airport looking for flights to get on.
                    After all that we've been through, I don't think that you want the four or five
                    of us to be in that position at a time when the airport is closed in Amman,
                    Jordan. Therefore, I have a better idea.” My idea was to charter an Iraqi 747,
                    because when we ran our charter flights, because of the nature of the sanctions
                    and the Iraqi counteractions to the sanctions, the Iraqis only allowed Iraqi
                    charter flights to take off. So I suggested we charter the one Iraqi Boeing
                    747...</p>

                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. It was in the Iraqi air inventory. I said, “We'll charter
                    that. We'll fly to Amman, Jordan, and we'll pick up the 300 odd Americans who
                    are stuck in Amman, and we will fly everybody to Germanall the Americans who are
                    stranded in Amman.” They came back and said, “Well, we take your point, but we
                    don't think that we want to charter this flight to go to Amman, Jordan, and pick
                    up everybody; so why don't you just charter a smaller aircraft, the 727, and fly
                    yourself and all the Americans still in Iraq to Germany.” So we did that. We
                    chartered the 727; we reserved seats for ourselves and four or five others, and
                    then we cast about for any other Americans who might still be in Iraq and who
                    might want to leave, including this one American who by then had married an
                    Iraqi woman. He decided he wasn't going to go; he was going to stay with her. We
                    ended up taking two American journalists with us. One was Jim Blystone from CNN
                    who had been behind the lines when Saigon fell and didn't feel the need to do it
                    a second time. He left with us to be followed in Baghdad by Peter Arnett, I
                    never met Peter Arnett in Baghdad. He arrived literally as we were leaving, so I
                    never met him until after the war. The second press passenger was a journalist
                    from the Boston Globe; he also had been stuck behind the lines when Saigon fell.
                    The rest of the American journalists who were there, including Marie Colvin, and
                    the CNN team, which by this time was John Hollaman and Verna Shonin and Peter
                    and their producers, had decided to stay. Robert Weiner and the others decided
                    they were going to stay. Then we offered seats to other diplomats on a first
                    come/first served basis. Curiously the Brits, feckless allies in this, had
                    decided to decamp two days previously; they had departed under the guise of
                    darkness, and sent me a note saying, “By the time you get this, we will be
                    across the border. So long, sucker.” So they had made that decision. It was very
                    ironic because at one point there were discussions underway about extracting us
                    clandestinely. The Brits had come up with an elaborate scenario which would have
                    had us driving out east towards Iran, leaving Iraq through the Iranian border.
                    They were going to fly some helicopters in and pick us up in the middle of the
                    night and fly us off to safety. I said, “Absolutely not.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd thought a bit about the Iranian attempt to get
                        hostages out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>WILSON: I was certainly familiar with that. But that was not the reason. The
                    reason was that I felt that we had been the glue that had held everything
                    together in Baghdad. Since we were still in Baghdad, all other diplomatic
                    mission were still there. It was quite clear that they were going to leave if
                    and when we decided to leave, and they were going to stay so long as we stayed.
                    It was important in everything that we did that there be others than the
                    Americans involved; it was useful to us to have them there. It was useful
                    because you always wanted an intermediary, somebody who was going to soften the
                    blow, somebody who was going to try and find a third way, somebody who was going
                    to report back to the Iraqis that, 'gee, it's really a stupid idea for you to
                    keep these hostages because the Americans are coming whether you want them or
                    not,' which is what Primakov told them. Even though he tried to manipulate the
                    situation to his advantage, his last message to them was, “The Americans are
                    going to come whether we want them or not. We're not going to stop them, and
                    you're not going to stop them.” We needed third parties; it was important then
                    not to abandon the other diplomats as we left in the darknesthese people and
                    their governments who had been part of this drama. That is what I basically told
                    Operations Center and they who put this plan together still remember. They've
                    since forgiven me for it, but they still remember that this “jerk” was sitting
                    in Baghdad saying, “The only way that I'm going to do this is if I'm given a
                    direct order from the president of the United States. When I say 'direct,' I
                    want him to call me on the telephone and tell me that that's what he wants me to
                    do.” They didn't do it, so my position was upheld obviously. We went out. We
                    took the flag with us and flew out on the 12th. We took most of the other
                    diplomats. The French stayed and left by automobile the next day. The Turks
                    stayed a little bit longer. I can't remember when or if they left. I think they
                    stayed until after the war broke out. Some of the others stayed; the Algerians
                    stayed and a few others stayed. Most of the rest, certainly all the Western
                    diplomats, we took with us and we flew to Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>We spent the night in Germany. One of my fondest memories of arriving in Germany,
                    in Frankfurt, was of one of my longtime colleagues in African Affairs, Harry
                    Geizl, meeting us and carrying my suitcase. He a very interesting character, and
                    if you didn't believe that, he would to tell you; a man full of enthusiasm and
                    very competent. That moment was carried bCNN. We then flew back to Washington on
                    the 13th on a regular PanAm flight, and on the 14th, which was Monday, I went to
                    the office. I went to the office only because I didn't know what else to do with
                    myself. I had to deal with jet lag and culture shock, but perhaps even more
                    dramatic was the fact that the whole drama had played out suddenly and there's
                    nothing more I could do; it's such a letdown. I still couldn't sleep. We had
                    existed on maybe three or four hours of sleep per night. I would stay up until
                    the 2:30 in the morning when the news coverage was oveBBC broadcasted from 2:00
                    to 2:30 coverage using their leading Middle East experts. I would be up at 6:30
                    and be in the embassy to get the last briefings from Washington before I started
                    my day. I would read the press clippings from the previous day, which would have
                    been our night, and then I would be ready to go. I would go home shortly after
                    lunch and take about a twhour nap; so I ended up sleeping at most four hours at
                    night and then maybe an hour or two in the afternoon, and this went on seven
                    days a week for six months. It got to the point at which we were always trying
                    to get an angle on these guys. It became really an obsession with us on how to
                    get these Americans out of Irahow to save them, how to keep them from a terrible
                    fate. Even at night I would sleep for an hour or so and then I would get up and
                    do something I had never done in my life: I would pace. I had marble floors, and
                    I would pace back and forth, back and forth for hours on end. There came a time
                    when I had no idea where else to go with all of this. This was in early November
                    and I was feeling pretty poorly. I had the flu or something; I got Kissinger's
                    book on how he saved the world for the American way off the shelf, and I read up
                    on his meetings in the 1970s with Sadat while enmeshed in the Arab Israeli
                    conflict as our national security advisor. I remember he said that he went to
                    see Sadat and found Sadat a most impressive individual, a man of considerable
                    integrity and a man who had assured him that nothing untoward would come of the
                    tension between Egypt and Israel. He left feeling that peace was in the offing.
                    This was three weeks before the Egyptian army crossed the Sinai only to get
                    their butts kicked. So I figured if the Middle East had defeated old “Hank”
                    Kissinger, “Super Hank,” what the hell, I could be excused for not having a real
                    quick, successful solution either.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>The day after I got bacI got back on the 14tI went to the officagain really
                    because I just didn't know what else to do with myself. I couldn't sleep; I was
                    just really sort of strung out. I got a call to be over at the White House at
                    one o'clock or something like that. I went over in a State car with John Kelly,
                    the assistant secretary for Middle Eastern affairs, and one or two other people.
                    We get there and were ushered into the Roosevelt Room, which is the room outside
                    the Oval Office. We were met by Chief of Protocol Joseph Verner Reed, who had
                    been David Rockefeller's executive assistant for a number of years, was
                    appointed to be our ambassador to Morocco. After that he became the chief of
                    protocol and then went to the United Nations in a management josomething like
                    that. I think that was his career track. Reed took me to meet the President.
                    It's not often one would see the chief of protocol doing something like this.
                    Anyway, the time comes and the door opens and there's the president of the
                    United States. I went up and shook hands with him, and I said to hiwe'd never
                    really talked, we had a couple of exchanges of cables but we hadn't really
                    talke“We never talked during this past six months, but I have to tell you that I
                    felt from the very beginning we were on the same wave length,” which was true. I
                    felt from the very beginning that this was a very serious situation that we
                    would confront militarily, and he did as well. He said, “You're absolutely
                    right.” Then he turned into the Oval Office. Behind him was basically the War

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>WILSON: The secretary of defense was not there. He was the only secretary that
                    wasn't there. The head of the FBI was there, and there were three or four
                    others. I didn't hear what the president said to participants but John Kelly
                    told me later that he had turned to them and he said, “Gentlemen, let me
                    introduce you to a true American hero.” I shook hands all around, not knowing
                    what he'd said about me. He could have said, “Let me introduce you to this
                    asshole that we had out there in Baghdad.” Kelly came up to me afterwards and
                    said, “That's not what he said about you. He said something else.” I'll show you
                    the picture afterwards; I think I've got a picture, maybe not. In the Oval
                    Office the desk is here, the windows are there, there is a sofa over here and
                    chairs on either side of the fireplace, then another sofa. I'm sitting on the
                    sofa next to Jim Baker; the president is sitting here, and on the other side
                    there were all the other people; right by the desk is sitting Brent Scowcroft.
                    The press comes in and the president says, “Don't say anything to them;” so I
                    didn't say anything; I just smiled. They took a bunch of pictures. Then the door
                    was closed and we started talking; I started talking. I'm answering questions
                    from the high level officials and talking about the Iraq situation as I saw it.
                    I'm running literally on sheer adrenalin; I'm not conscious in any way; I have
                    no nerves and I'm not feeling uptight; I'm not feeling nervous being with these
                    people. I'm just theranother day at the office. About halfway through, I looked
                    around the room; there was a lull, somebody else was talking. I looked around
                    and across, sitting next to the president's desk, is Brent Scowcroft. He has his
                    legal size pad, and he's writing down everything I'm saying. It was my first
                    conscious thought since I had awakened that morning. I looked across and I
                    thought to myself: “Who would have ever thought that this California ex hippie
                    surfer would someday be sitting in the Oval Office briefing the president of the
                    United States and his War Cabinet on matters of military import, and that the
                    note taker would be the national security advisor?” When I came to this
                    realization, I got nervous and tongue tied. But by this time the meeting was
                    almost over. The meeting ended and I walk out. The president's personal aide, I
                    guess, comes up to me and says, “The president wants to know if you would like
                    to come over to the residence and meet Mrs. Bush. She'd like to meet you.” I
                    said, “Sure.” I thought to myself: “I've got nothing else on my schedule.” So we
                    walked over to the residence. We actually walked out in front of the residence,
                    the diplomatic entrance. Mrs. Bush was in a wheelchair at the time; they brought
                    her out. I didn't know what to say to her, but I remembered that when she was in
                    the Arabian Desert, some soldier carrying his gun had come up to her and said he
                    wanted a hug. She said, “Well, I've never hugged a gun before.” So I walked up
                    to her and I said, “I read what you said in Time Magazine when you hugged that
                    soldier, and I just wanted to assure you, “I'm not carrying a gun but I could
                    sure use a hug too.” She said “absolutely.” At that time she had broken leg from
                    a sledding accident. So she was in the wheelchair with her leg propped up. She
                    reaches up and grabs me and she gives me a great big hug. To be hugged by
                    Barbara Bush is really something. It's something not to be missed if you ever
                    have the chance. She's great at that, and she's a great lady. As she's hugging
                    mit's a January day, it's a bright January dasuddenly there's this shadow coming
                    across. I looked around, I was still in her grasp, and I looked around and it's
                    the president. He has walked out of the Oval Office to join us, only to catch me
                    in an embrace with his wife. He understood that there was nothing else there. We
                    stood there, just the three of us, and Millie, and the photographer always
                    followed the president.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Millie being the dog.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A cocker spaniel. We talked for about another 15 minutes. The president
                    asked me questions about what it was like in the streets of Baghdad he was
                    interested in some human interest stories. Then he said, “I've got to go take a
                    phone call.” We walked back across the rose garden. I have a picture that I'll
                    show you before you go, something that I keep in my office. This was literally
                    36 hours before Desert Storm kicked off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you about how you were or weren't used by
                        the Department of State during the Desert Storm period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>WILSON: By the time I got out of Baghdad I was pretty much a spent force. I was
                    physically exhausted and I was mentally exhausted. Seeing the president and then
                    36 hours later watching CNN as the bombs began to drop on Baghdad was all very,
                    verI don't want to say 'stressful' because we're sort of beyond stresit was very
                    discombobulating. Frankly, for the first couple weeks after I returned all I
                    wanted to do was sleep and get out of town. I found life in Washington to be so
                    far different from life in Baghdad, particularly having come back after having
                    been on television a lot. I would get on elevators and people would stare at me
                    not knowing whether they should say hello to me. Some people on the sidewalks
                    would stop me and talk to me about Baghdad. That was kind of fun, but it was
                    difficult to go back to being a private citizen. I actually turned down requests
                    to go on the Larry King and the Leslie Stahl programs. She was doing some
                    interview program at that time, but I just felt that I had done my bit and
                    wanted to go back to being anonymous. I actually left and went away to the
                    Caribbean for a couple weeks and came back refreshed and rejuvenated, tanned and
                    rested. I went back to the Department, and Ron Newman, who is now our ambassador
                    in Bahrain, was then the director of the office of Northern Gulf AffairIran and
                    Iraasked me if I'd be willing to help out, which I did. I on the desk and dealt
                    with those issues that come up during the time of war. Now admittedly there
                    wasn't a hell of a lot. We discussed some post war stuff but not a lot. Most of
                    the work on the desk was worrying about various groups which some interest or
                    another and which wanted their views to be heard, or about people who had
                    offsprings in Iraq who had been taken by, most often, by the father back to Iraq
                    and thereby separated from the mother. I did some bomb damage assessment, VDA,
                    in the bowels of the Pentagon. Every time the Iraqis would show a damaged sacred
                    site, Baghdad Museum or a mosque or something, I would go to the Pentagon to
                    work with staff there looking at pictures to try to figure out where these bombs
                    had hit and where the sites were that the Iraqis had refused let us get in. We
                    had one bomb that skipped off an intended site and actually hit, I think, the
                    Algerian embassy. There was a bit of work to be done on that. But by this time
                    most of the action had shifted from the State Department to the Pentagon; so
                    there wasn't a whole hell of a lot for us to do. I spent several weeks doing
                    that and then transitioned off into my next life, which was in the Senior
                    Seminar in June.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. I think everybody who kind of thought about this period ten years
                    later has agreed that during the prosecution of the war, nobody had taken a good
                    look at what we were going to do after the end of the war. I've talked to
                    everybody from Richard Haas to Brent Scowcroft and most people in between since
                    then about this issue. In fact, we hadn't really figured out what talking points

                <p>WILSON: At the end of the ground campaign, the 100 hours when the Iraqis

                <p>WILSON: Yes. Schwarzkopf, who was in command of the troops, is the one who with
                    his generals went off to meet with Iraqis on the Iraqi Kuwait border after we
                    had driven them out of Kuwaito discuss and negotiate the terms of the cease
                    fire.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes at the lower ranks you at least get people

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not that I was aware of. Curiously, the office that I was assigned to was
                    a pretty small office; there weren't a lot of people around there. As I said,
                    most of the action had shifted over to the Pentagon; so if there was any
                    thinking going on about post war, nobody was calling me to ask me what I thought
                    about post war Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody asked whether Saddam Hussein could survive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Nobody asked me. We did talk a bit about whether Saddam Hussein was
                    suicidal or not. That was always a question in everybody's mind as we were
                    looking at how far we might have to go and how hard we might have to prosecute
                    the military action. April Glaspie was back in Washington at this time. We used
                    to discuss at some length with people in the Department, and with people at CIA
                    what we thought was Saddam's driving force. I think we concluded, and I think we
                    were correct in this, that ultimately Saddam might not have feared death, but
                    that Saddam was the ultimate survivor and Saddam was very much in the mode owas

                <p>WILSON: “Apres moi, le deluge,” but it was really more “L'�tat, c'est moi.”
                    Saddam was prepared to kill as many Iraqis as necessary because as long as he
                    survived, he was the embodiment of the state of Iraq; he was Iraq. He was more
                    than willing to sacrifice literally tens of thousands of his fellow citizens in
                    his really fruitless enterprise. As long as he survived, then the state of Iraq
                    and the glory of Iraq survived in his somewhat twisted mind. We concluded that,
                    while he didn't physically fear or worry about dying, ultimately he saw himself
                    embodied as the spirit of the state and of the Iraqi nation and as a consequence
                    his survival was of some interest to him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Mack, who was in NEA during this time, said that he

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was not in that meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the mindset. This was the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I think that's right. I think it's very clear that the administration at
                    the end of the war assumed that all that was needed, as President Bush said, was
                    for the Iraqis to take matters in their own hands. That led to the uprisings by
                    the Shiite and by the Kurds which Saddam was able to put down because he had
                    superior military assets and was able to fly his helicopters against them. I
                    think very clearly that it was the assumption of everybody involved at the
                    decision making levels that Saddam would not survive this massive military
                    defeat. I think Bush has actually written this in the book he wrote with
                    Scowcroft. Clearly they did not anticipate Saddam's ability to hang on in the
                    face of such a major military defeat and the subsequent humiliation of having
                    sanctions imposed and having the no fly zones, etc.</p>

                        Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>WILSON: I went to the Senior Seminar. I had a lot of issues with the Department
                    of State's administrative operations over things like insurance claims and what
                    not with which I had to deal. I found that the bureaucracy was very unpleasant
                    experience to deal with, particularly after all that I had been through. It was
                    very unpleasant to come back to find petty bureaucrats dealing with our
                    insurance claims in what can only be describeat besas a cavalier manner and at
                    worst treating us as if we were criminals until proven otherwise. That took a
                    lot of time. In fact, it took me almost three years to sort that out. I had to
                    make several visits to the inspector general's office and to the undersecretary
                    for management and to the undersecretary for political affairs before I could
                    get some response from the Claims Bureau. If there was one thing that soured me
                    and most of my colleagues and their families on working for the State
                    Department, it was the treatment that we received from the people who were there
                    to provide support services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned families. Your wife and children, did they
                        get much support from the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My wife stayed in France. We had an apartment at the time down in the
                    South of France. She got very little support at the beginning. According to Jim
                    Baker, he had to call our ambassador in Paris to get State people in Marseilles
                    and Paris to pay some attention to our evacuees in those cities. Part of that
                    may have been that they just weren't focused on having an evacuee in their
                    consular district and, therefore, let it slip. Why it had to go to the secretary
                    of state before it was resolved is anybody's guess, but once he got involved,
                    then it worked out pretty well. Most of the families have varying degrees of
                    dissatisfaction with the system. I think the higher level of satisfaction on the
                    part of the people whose husbands had been taken hostage was due to what the
                    embassy was trying to do in Baghdad; it was far higher than the level of
                    satisfaction of the family members which relied on the support from the
                    Department of State. This became a big bone of contention and was something that
                    was hashed out at great length with the undersecretary for management, the
                    family liaison office, the director general's office over a period of several
                    months. I think subsequent evacuations have been handled a little bit better.
                    There has been some more sensitivity to the needs of the family members,
                    although for the life of me I cannot believe that it would be so hard able to
                    crack the nut of the Claims Office, which basically operates on the assumption
                    that you're all criminals until you prove otherwise when you file insurance
                    claims for everything that you have lost in life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senior Seminar, you did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I did that from the summer of 1991 to the summer of 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>WILSON: I thought it was great. It was a terrific year to be back in the States.
                    It was an opportunity to look at exactly what the Seminar is designed to d.i.e.
                    to give an officer a much broader perspective on what the United States is all
                    abouwhether it's traveling to Alaska or traveling through downtown Baltimore
                    with city cops. We did all of that. We spent time on farms in Indiana. We went
                    to Nome, Alaska and to Prudhoe Bay. We went to military bases in Texas and drove
                    the Bradley fighting vehicle and the Abrams tank. We flew onto aircraft carriers
                    off San Diego. We saw a lot of how the military works, which is key if you are
                    in a senior policy making position. You want to know how that military operation
                    functions so that you know what you are talking about. Then we had the
                    opportunity to do a number of things related to the criminal justice system and
                    to other Cabinet level departmente.g. Health and Human Service. We learned
                    something about how to deal with our own society and our own social problems,
                    and things like that. I thought it was a most worthwhile year. The one thing
                    that differentiates the military from other elements of the U.S. government is
                    the amount of attention they give to training. In the military you essentially
                    do one line job, staff job, and then one training assignment; so you can expect
                    during the course of a 27 year career to have at least six or seven training
                    assignments. It makes for really a well rounded officer as you rise in the
                    system. In the State Department you're lucky if you can get two years during the
                    course of a 2or 26 year career. One might be the Senior Seminar, which is
                    restricted to 16 or 17 officers per year; so you don't get a lot of officers who
                    have this experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went through in 1974 or 1975. I think you have pointed
                        out one of the problems. There is another one: the military takes care of
                        what we don't officially, and that's what we're doing right here. They have
                        a very active oral history prograwhat did you do, how did it work, how
                        didn't it work, and all that. That's what we're doing here, but we're doing
                        it without government sponsorship. It's sort of goes against the
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>WILSON: If there was one area in which we really need to put some more resources,
                    it's in the training of our diplomats; you can see that. The Department of State
                    had a personnel system that for years was operated to the disadvantage of
                    minorities and females. The Department of State did not take care of the
                    problem. The solution was finally judicially imposed upon us. One of the
                    remedies was to put females and minorities into leadership positions. The Air
                    Force, where I worked later, had seen this as an issue way ahead of the State
                    Department; it actually began training so that, when the time came, there were
                    minority people who were well prepared to move in and succeed in the leadership
                    positions. The State Department, because the change was judicially imposed and
                    required to do it within a very narrow time frame, ended up setting people up
                    for failure by not giving them the training, by not preparing them to assume the
                    responsibilities that they were going to be called upon to accept. Training is
                    key if you ever hope to have a successful State Department. The employment of
                    retired generals in various foreign policy and diplomatic positions is clear
                    evidence of the competence of the military bolstered by their training, while
                    the State Department just continues to issue visas or not, as the case may be.
                    That's too bad, because at the end of the day, military training and experience
                    gives one a view of issues from a military perspective, which is not the only
                    perspective and certainly can not be the prevailing one in sensitive diplomatic
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1992 you're coming out of Senior Seminar. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Before I went to the Senior Seminar, I had lunch with the senior deputy
                    assistant secretary for African Affairs, during which he slipped me a piece of
                    paper which had a list of about 10 ambassadorial jobs on it. He asked me which
                    one I wanted. I looked at it and I concluded I wanted the one that fit me most
                    nicely, Gabon. So I said, “I want Gabon,” and so they gave me Gabon. I got
                    nominated. The whole nomination process is one that goes on for months.</p>
                <p>I was informed that I was going to be nominated in September, something like
                    thaSeptember October 1991 time frame. I filled out all of the forms, got
                    everything in, and finally was nominated about February March of 1992; then I
                    went up and had my hearings in June of 1992, received my confirmation and was
                    sworn in at the consulate in Marseilles on July. My papers from the president
                    were signed on July 14th, Bastille Daa French national day. We had the swearing
                    in ceremony in Marseilles shortly thereafter.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>The nomination process was interesting. I went up for my hearing, which was
                    chaired by Paul Simon, the Democratic senator from Illinois. The ranking
                    minority member was Nancy Katzenbaum, now Nancy Katzenbaum Baker, who was the
                    Republican senator from Kansas. They were both active in the Senate African
                    Affairs Subcommittee. There were five nominees. I positioned myself consciously
                    between Princeton Lyman, who was going to South Africa as ambassador, and the
                    fellow who was going to Ghana as ambassador because I figured that all the
                    questions would go to theall the tough questions: “What are you doing in South
                    Africa?” etc. Everybody knew Ghana; nobody really knew much about Gabon or Sao
                    Tome and Principe. The senators asked the questions. They came to me and they
                    asked a couple of questions on Sao Tome, a question on Gabon, and then the door
                    opens behind Paul Simon. As you know, the senators sit on a dias in the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee hearing room; they look down at you, which is a
                    great way of intimidating yoand they're very successful at doing it, I might
                    add, even though both Nancy Katzenbaum and Paul Simon are just as nice as the
                    day is long. But it is an intimidating experience if you haven't done it before
                    and you haven't really had to address that sort of conclave before. The door
                    opens behind Simon and Peter Galbraith comes in. As I mentioned before, Peter
                    was Claiborne Pell's staff assistant who had been very active on Kurdish matters
                    in Iraq. He had seen me come into the hearing and we had exchanged pleasantries
                    and gone on our way. He came in and handed Simon a bunch of questions. Simon
                    looks down at me and says, “Mr. Wilson, now I'd like to ask you a few questions
                    about your previous job.” He had about 14 questions on Iraq, and most of them
                    were designed to produce some statement that would be potentially incriminating
                    to either Larry Eagleburger or Jim Baker or people up in the chain of command.
                    Fundamentally what Simon wanted me to say was that we had advised the State
                    Department that Saddam Hussein was engaged in the systematic abuse of the human
                    rights of its citizens, which is the trigger phrase for the cutting off of U.S.
                    assistance programs to Iraq. We had a billion dollar commodity credit program
                    which was an agricultural subsidy program. We gave the Iraqi short term credit,
                    short term loans, at commercial interest rates to buy American agricultural
                    product, but since these were U.S. government guaranteed loans, the bankers
                    really lined up to get involved. So it was of some benefit to U.S. bankers; it
                    was of benefit to the Iraqis because they could get a ready source of money to
                    buy foodstuffs; and it was good for American farmers. But the program was
                    contentious because it was so large and Iraq had become such a flash point of
                    congressional interest. All 14 questions were designed to somehow get me to say
                    that. Paul Simon, God bless him, asked the first couple of questions and then
                    said, “Look, let me just ask you to go ahead and submit your answers to these
                    questions in writing.” I went back and I called up the Department of State and
                    said, “I've got all these questions. Can I get somebody to help me answer them,
                    because they're related to U.S. policy towards Iraq before Desert Storm?” The
                    response from the Bureau was, “No, we've thought about it, and you really just
                    ought to go ahead and answer those questions yourself.” I said, “Okay, fine.” It
                    was really a stupid answer. If you wanted to protect Jim Baker and Larry
                    Eagleburger, then they should have been prepared to write the answers to these
                    questions. They didn't see it that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>I went and I got all the human rights reports that we had written during the
                    years I was in Iraq, and I spent the weekend with a typewriter answering the
                    questions. The questions had to be inserted in the Congressional Record, and had
                    to be answered as if you were answering a senator face to face. The question
                    from Senator Simon to Joe Wilson would read: “Mr. Wilson...” and then the answer
                    from Mr. Wilson would read: “Senator Simon, if you would take the time to review
                    the Department of State human rights reports, which are submitted to Congress
                    every year, and if you look at the period of time that I was in Baghdad, you'll
                    see that these human rights reports said and I quote in part: 'Saddam
                    systematically killed people, Saddam tortured people, Saddam did this to them
                    and did that to them and did everything else to them.' Senator, I frankly think
                    that the embassy discharged its responsibilities admirably in this matter.” Of
                    course, nobody reads these questions and answers, but they are entered in the
                    congressional record as part of the testimony. I think Peter at least was hoping
                    that I would say that,”Yes, the embassy reported on this and the damn Department
                    didn't do anything about it,” but I wasn't going to do that. I turned the
                    answers around by making the point that these human rights reports were
                    submitted to Congress every year as part of a congressional requirement. I got
                    away with it. I've seen Galbraith a couple of times since. He called me up
                    afterwards and said, “You know, I didn't do that to put you on the spot. I did
                    it because we wanted to get on the record what the administration's thinking
                    was.” Then curiously I got a call from Tom Callahan, who at that time was a
                    staffer for Jesse Helms; he had always been the big bugaboo for the Department
                    of State. He had actually interviewed me before I went up to my hearing. He
                    called me up to say, “Look, I just want you to know that we did not expect this.
                    We were blind sided by those questions. I want you to know that I would not have
                    allowed that to happen had I been able to put a stop to it. I consider that to
                    be unfair,” which I thought was very decent of him. It didn't help me in my
                    views of Senator Helms, but he knows that. It was very decent of him, and he has
                    remained a friend to this day.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Ask him about that. Tell him I haven't forgotten.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Yes, they were, and for good reason. I think he's a little over the top
                    on that issue. At the end of the day, as history has since proven, I used to
                    say, “If the Kurds don't have an Arab to fight, they'll fight each other,” and
                    that's clearly what's happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>I went to the Gabonese Republic. It's always called the Gabonese Republic because
                    Bongo wants his country to be known in the feminine tense in French, because 'La
                    France' is feminine. 'Le Gabon' is masculine, which in the great scheme of
                    things was viewed by Bongo as being of lesser stature than feminine 'La France.'
                    So you don't call it 'Le Gabon,' you call it 'La R�publique Gabone;' that gives
                    it stature. I was also ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and
                    Principe. My orders read that I should serve concomitantlbeing ambassador to the
                    Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe came without additional
                    compensation; so it was a two for one. I got to be ambassador to two countries;
                    got paid for being ambassador to one. I resided in Libreville. Had a great Peace
                    Corps program in Sao Tome and Principe, had a $60,000,000 Voice of America
                    transmitter station built while I was there. We basically were the GDP of the
                    country for the three years that I was there with our investment.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>WILSON: Sao Tome was one of the very first countries in Africa to move
                    successfully from a dictatorship to a democratically elected president. The
                    incumbent, Peter Dakoshta, had been voted out of office. They'd gone through
                    something akin to a national conference and had moved to elections. A number of
                    parties had grown umaybe three parties. We should note the Sao Tome and Principe
                    was a former Portuguese colony; it gained its independence in 1975, when most of
                    the Portuguese colonies got their independence and had been ruled by Peter
                    Dakoshta since. It had been a one party state. It comprises of three main
                    islands, which straddle the Equator about 200 miles off the coast of Gabon which
                    have a total population of about 160,000 people. When it came time to say
                    farewell to Secretary of State Jim Baker, I went up to his offiche's got a big
                    ceremonial office and then he's got a little hide away office where he did most
                    of his work. He had me into his hide away office. He actually had opened his
                    atlas to Sao Tome and Principe. He had been looking at the map and had some
                    interesting questions to ask about the mountain range that went through the
                    spine of Sao Tome and other geographical highlights. It is one of the poorest
                    countries in Africa, and it is the one country that doesn't have the tribal
                    structure to support it in time of poverty. It was discovered by the Portuguese
                    in the 15th century. There's some question as to whether there were actually
                    people living on Sao Tome at the time. During the intervening several hundred
                    years, people moved to Sao Tomfrom Angola or Cape Verde or some of the other
                    Portuguese colonies. They moved there to farm and to the harvest the cocoa
                    plantations. Cocoa was its big cash crop for several centuries. The Portuguese
                    landowners and plantation owners had set up really elaborate social structures
                    to take care of their indentured farmers, farm staff and farm laborers. They had
                    hospitals, they had schools, they had housing but it was very much like what you
                    would see on plantations in the south of the United States.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 19th century, I guess, there was a Brit who decided that Sao
                    Tome cocoa, which at that time was the most highly prized and most expensive on
                    the London cocoa exchange, was being produced by slave labor and, as a
                    consequence, there had to be an investigation into the labor practices that was
                    producing the cocoa. It took about three years to produce a cocoa crop. During
                    the course of those three years, the hullabaloo over the procurement of Sao Tome
                    cocoa was so great that it went out of favor and the chocolate that replaced as
                    the best seller came from Ghanaian cocoa field owned by a certain Brit, whose
                    name was Cadburthe same person who had raised questions about Sao Tome labor
                    practices. So Cadbury actually engineered the collapse of the Sao Tome economy
                    for his own benefit and the economy has never recovered. The market collapse
                    raised serious social problems because so much of the labor had been importeeven
                    if it's been imported several decades or hundreds of years. When that labor was
                    imported, it was taken out of a village structure in the former country and put
                    into a plantation structure. As the plantations fell apart there was nothing for
                    that labor to fall back upon.</p>

                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>WILSON: They couldn't go back to the village. There was nothing there. There was
                    nothing there except for the plantations. So the workers just continued to squat
                    on those plantations. It is very interesting to watch how they made this
                    transition over the past several decades. They've managed to keep the peace. If
                    there is one thing they understood, it was that violent outbursts had to be
                    contained because at the end of the day there was no place else to go. They were
                    stuck on this island together, and they seem to understand that better than some
                    of the countries on the continent.</p>
                <p>By the time I got there, they had held elections which Miguel Trovuarda had won.
                    He had been a figure of some historic importance in Sao Tome's independence
                    movement in the 1960s and the 1970s, and he was the president. Peter Dakoshta
                    still lived on the island. He had gone away for a while but had returned and was
                    living in semi retirement. They had a flourishing prime minister's offica prime
                    minister run government. They had a nice port facility. They were generally
                    abused by everybody. European and Japanese fleets would come and fish in their
                    waters and then sail away with the catch without paying whatever they were
                    supposed to be pay, because there was no coast guard to guard their territory.
                    There was one old South African who ran a good part of the island; he had been
                    there for many, many years. He ran who knows what in and out of Angola during
                    the Angolan War, and he used Sao Tome as his base. The Angolans had a certain
                    amount of influence. Bongo himself had a certain amount of influence. We liked
                    Sao Tome because, for one, we had a little Peace Corps program there which was
                    great. They did a hell of a job there. Secondly, it was a good location for
                    setting up our Voice of America transmitter station after Liberia fell apart. We
                    invested quite a bit of money and quite a bit of time to build a repeater
                    station for the Voice of America programs which were beamed to Sao Tome, then
                    across the water to Central and West Africa. We found out that the location was
                    just perfect. We actually got far greater reception range than we ever
                    anticipated when we went into this project. For some reason the water just
                    amplified our transmissiothe waves coming off of it or coming over ito the point
                    that we were in a constant fight with Radio Vatican, because we were kind of
                    overrunning their frequencies. We were all over them like a dirty shirt. You
                    dialed up thinking that you were going to hear the Pope and you got the Voice of
                    America. That was interesting. That was about it for Sao Tome and Principe.</p>

                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>WILSON: Sao Tome and Principe had never been very high on anybody's screen. When
                    Peter Dakoshta was president, it was firmly in the Marxist Leninist camp, and
                    yet all the kids went to Portugal for school. We were not going to be in the
                    lead of fighting the Soviets for Sao Tome and Principe. We had very little to do
                    with it. When it was firmly in the Soviet camp, we just basically ignored it and
                    nobody went over there. Their port facilities were minimal. It was not used the
                    same way that Pointe Noire was used in the Congo to traffic Cuban soldiers and
                    Cuban equipment to the Angolan War. When I was in the Congo in the late 1980s,
                    Sao Tome had just been benignly neglected by us. That said, during the time that
                    I was there, the French had a big development mission there and the Portuguese
                    were trying to maintain their status as the former colonial power. The French
                    were giving them a run for their money. They were trying to talk the Sao Tomeans
                    into adopting the French backed CFA currency so they'd be part of the CFA zone.
                    The French were trying to make them part of this larger grouping of French
                    Central African countries. I remember going Sao Tome one time and having dinner
                    with the Portuguese ambassador. Over coffee he couldn't contain himself anymore
                    and he started talking about the French aid director, who was the brother of the
                    French ambassador to Gabon. They were both from Corsica, and he said to me, “We
                    in Portugal, we've had a lot of experience keeping the Corsicans from taking
                    over our territory.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A reference to Napoleon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A reference to Napoleon. He said, “We did it a couple times in the 19th
                    century, or 18th century, and, by God, we'll do it again here.” I had lunch the
                    next day with the French aid director. Toward the end of the lunch, he could no
                    longer restrain himself and said to me, “You know, the Portuguese here, they
                    have this long history, but frankly they're just no longer up to the task of
                    providing what's necessary for these little countries,”as he smoked his Gaulois
                    cigarette. That was the unkindest cut of all. Later the relationship between the
                    two of them got so bad that they wouldn't talk to each other and they wouldn't
                    go to the same events. If there a ship come in on a diplomatic event, they would
                    not be on the same boat going out to the ship. In a small town like Sao Tome
                    that becomes the talk of the town. It was great fun and very, very humorous, but
                    it showed how, even in a period of rapid communications, even at the very end of
                    the supply chain you can get these little tiny conflicts between these
                    representatives of two countries. It was kind of a throwback to a different
                    ersort of Graham Greene in all his glory. I can see him writing the ultimate
                    story on this.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the Peace Corps doing?</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>WILSON: The Peace Corps was doing everything. We had a great AID funded program
                    which was designed to teach cooperative management skills to Sao Tomean cocoa
                    growers. At the time of the collapse of the plantations, there had been
                    considerable land reform. They were trying to get these little cocoa growers to
                    come together and figure out how they're going to manage their affairs and their
                    crops cooperatively and how they might band together to become more powerful.
                    Peace Corps volunteers were doing everything from digging wells to teaching
                    English to doing health supporthings like. There were only about 25 or 30 of
                    them, but on a small island, they were all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing anything to try to promote chocolate
                        purchases from the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was sort of an international cartel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes; they have their own marketing system. Guys who buy chocolate know
                    how to do it; guys who sell chocolate know how to do it. I think we would have
                    liked to have worked with them on processing the cocoa. There are a number of
                    stages that you have to go through from raw cocoa to a chocolate bar. It has to
                    be dried and then it could be roasted and then it could be powdered and made
                    into a paste. In San Tome, they only dried it, then did whatever they had to do
                    to stabilize it before they sent it off for further processing. They sent it off
                    in bulk; most of the other rendering of the cocoa, the next steps, were done
                    elsewhere. Clearly that was one of the things with which, if we could have, we
                    would have liked to have helped them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Principe? Where did that fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I only went to Principe once. I had a helicopter and flew over there
                    onconly the second time in the history of the island that a helicopter had
                    landed on it and only the first time in the lives of almost everybody on the
                    island. So it was quite an event. Principe has only about 6,000 people on it. It
                    has the most beautiful little port facility, but there's not very much there.
                    The same South African had developed a little resort area for deep sea fishermen
                    who would come from South Africa and spend weekends there fishing. But that was
                    about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were part of Sao Tome?</hi>

                <p>WILSON: They were part of Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. The
                    relationship between the islands was always reasonably good. There was never any
                    sense that they were going to become a splinter group. They were going to stay
                    Sao Tome and Principe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to Gabon. Could you give a little background
                        about where it had come from and then what happened while you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Gabon is the home of Omar Bongo. Gabon was a former French colony. It
                    straddles the Equator. It is probably best known to Americans and Europeans as
                    the site of Albert Schweitzer's mission and hospital where he worked with lepers
                    and other people in Lamborini. He wrote of his experiences over the years. Gabon
                    is a land well endowed in natural resources. It has a lot of oil, uranium,
                    manganese, and timber. It has good fishing both in its rivers and off the coast.
                    It has a coast, it has forests, and savannahs in the interior. Gabon is lightly
                    populated; there are only about 1,200,000 Gabonese. The country is about the
                    size of Colorado. It has had a peaceful history. It is the one country in the
                    former French colonial empire that actually voted to remain French at the time
                    of independence, but we denied them that right: “You will be independent.” To
                    this day it has remained staunchly in the camp of the French. French interest in
                    Gabon is predicated on its historic ties and also on the very real and pragmatic
                    consequences of being a petroleum exporter. So ELF has been active in Gabon
                    since ELF has been active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ELF being the French oil company.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: ELF being the French state run petroleum company until recently. During
                    the time I was there, it was still state run. It later became privatized and was
                    gobbled up by Totol, so it is now Totol Pina ELI think that is its name now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say 'privatized', I think that's done with
                        quotations, isn't it, with ties to the French government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Initially for the transition period the French government held what they
                    called the “golden share,” which gave the government veto power over any
                    management decisions. Once it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on a
                    number of other exchanges, then it became subject to shareholder rights. Once it
                    became part of Totol Pina, it has been essentially privatized. The consequence
                    of that has been a long inquiry and audit into the way it did business when it
                    was a government enterprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some scandal about a mistress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, that's exactly right. There were several mistresses, but
                    the one who was mistress to Juman, the French minister of foreign affairs, who
                    later became the head of the constitutional court. She and he had concluded a
                    number of deals that were either government deals or were ELF deals or other
                    deals that were deemed to be inappropriate and illegal. Everybody was dragged
                    into ieverybody from Mitterrand to Juman to Servan to Lebo to anybody who had
                    ever been tangentially attached to Africa or to ELF. Bloit, who was the former
                    director general, spent almost three years in jail. This has been a nasty bit of
                    business, but the French keep the inquiry going and nobody knows where
                    ultimately it is going to end up. ELF Gabon has been one of the entities that
                    has been most heavily implicated in all of this scandal. The ELF Gabon
                    relationship with Bongo is one that has been very, very tight and has been the
                    mixture of politics and business interests for the benefit of both. I remember
                    the French chief of staff, equivalent of our chairman of the Joint Chiefs
                    telling me at one time that every time he went to Africa, he was just amazed to
                    see the extent to which organizations, both private and public, were in the
                    business of carrying suitcases full of money back and forth. In Gabon, ELF just
                    laundered money. They would bring money from France to pay for the Gabonese
                    elections, which meant the reelection of Bongo; then they would take money back
                    to France to pay for the election of whoever their favorite of the moment
                    wawhoever was running at the time. It was a very nasty little relationship. When
                    I was there, the French did everything they could to undermine the Congo because
                    the Congolese president had had the audacity to sell a lot of oil at below
                    market pricway below market pricto Occidental Petroleum. The Congolese had sold
                    it for about three dollars a barreall of it was up front. It was about
                    50,000,000 barrels; so it was a $150,000,000 cash payment, and for that ELF
                    thought that their position in the Congo was going to be undermined. As a
                    consequence it was prepared to destabilize the country to get the price
                    increased. They succeeded in doing so. At the end of the day I think that they
                    succeeded and we saved lives in the country as well. Scandalous. But anyway,
                    they were a fact of life on the scene. The French ambassador had been there for
                    12 years. His name was Luis Dominici, he is well known in the annals of
                    Francophone Africa. He was one of the last ambassadors whose education had been
                    in what they called the “French overseas”schooa colonial administrative school.
                    Gabon was for the French one of its prime postings. Ambassadors there served for
                    a long time because they were essentially viceroys who ran the country. Bongo
                    was personally selected by the French to replace his predecessor, Leon M'Ba when
                    he died.</p>

                <p>WILSON: 1967. He is still in power, the brightest politician I know in West
                    Africa; in fact maybe the brightest politician I know anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about Bongo and your relationship with
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>WILSON: El Haj Omar Bongo stands about five foot three or five foot four. To
                    compensate for his lack of stature, he wears boots that have maybe three inch
                    heels to give him a little bit more height. In his younger days, he was an
                    inveterate sipper of champagne and had an eye for the women, which in this day
                    and age would land him in lots of trouble with the politically correct. He was
                    known for actually chasing women around his officobviously quite boorish
                    behavior.</p>
                <p>Gabon is a different part of the world. I like to say that the difference between
                    the central Africans and the west Africans is that the west Africans don't have
                    a lot of resources; with what they do have they manufactured goods, and then
                    they trade back and forth. Great trading societies grew up in west Africa. In
                    contrast, in Gabon, you found lots of forests, making transit difficult. They
                    had to use a river system, which is cumbersome. Natural resources are plentiful.
                    If you want to eat fish, you just put a line in the water. If you want meat, you
                    just go out in the wooda place abundant with meat. If you wanted wine, you just
                    cut into a palm tree and waited. There isn't a lot of social interaction between
                    ethnic groups. In fact, the first marriage between a member of an ethnic groups
                    in the north, the Fang, and an ethnic group from the coast and the south, the
                    Gneni, took place in 1954, which was the same year that the U.S. Supreme Court
                    decided on” Brown versus the Board of Education.” That marriage was such an
                    event in the history of Gabon that it is still discussed to this dain terms of
                    the upheaval possible with ethnic groups.</p>
                <p>Bongo is Bateke; he came from the interior, and grew up in the Congo,
                    Brazzaville. Batekes sit astride the Congo Gabonese border. From early on, he
                    was directed into the bureaucratic work. I think he always seemed to be rather
                    clever. The rumor is that the French tested hilike a young Albert Bernarhis
                    tests results were right off the charts, at which point they decided that this
                    was going to be their guy. They moved him into positions of increasing
                    responsibility as Gabon moved through independence and the post independence
                    phaswhen the French still ran the country but behind the offices instead of at
                    the front desk. When Leon M'Ba died in 1967 of cancer, Bongo was the one that
                    the French supported for president. In his youtI used to talk to him about this
                    and kid him about ithe stories are that when he would host a party at his
                    palace, his minions would lock the doors and nobody could leave until Omar
                    himself had left, which was often not until three or four o'clock in the
                    morning. Many in the diplomatic set liked to be home by 10:30 and in bed by
                    eleven o'clock; they'd have to sit there until about three o'clock in the
                    morning. One of my predecessors at Gabon told me that someone finally realized
                    that if you went to a certain bathroom, you could open the window and crawl out
                    to get away from these parties. I used to kid Bongo about it. I used to go to
                    these parties and they still would go on until two o'clock in the morning, but
                    by this time, they left the doors open so that people could leave earlier. As a
                    matter of principal I used to stay until the president left. First, I thought it
                    was a wise thing to do in accordance with proper protocol. Secondly, with
                    everybody else leaving early, you were the last person seen by Bongo. Since we
                    wanted our interests to be favored in Gabon, it was useful to be seen to be
                    consistent with protocol and to be seen to be enjoying oneself. We enjoyed the
                    Gabonese tremendously. I enjoyed Bongo tremendously.</p>

                <p>When I first got there, we used to talk on a regular basis. In fact, the whole
                    time I was there, we used to talk on a regular basis. At the beginning, we
                    focused principally on the run up to their election at the end of 1993; that was
                    an 18 month project. We also talked at length about the convening of the second
                    African American Conference. The first one had taken place in Abidjan two years
                    earlier; the next one was going to be in Gabon. There was some question about
                    what the American government's role in this was going to be. Our ambassador in
                    Abidjan had essentially ignored the first meeting and had done nothing. We
                    decided we would try to make this something that we could buy into and use it to
                    our advantage; so we offered some support. We gave a reception in my house, we
                    offered some liaison assistance...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the organization...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The African American Summit was the brainchild of Leon Sullivan, who just
                    recently passed away. He was a Philadelphia civil rights leader and clergyman
                    who was very active in his city helping black youths attain equal opportunity.
                    His organization put together all sorts of programs. Then he took this program
                    internationally to Africa, where he saw some opportunities. I first ran into him
                    in Togo. Leon Sullivan is probably best known as the architect of the Sullivan
                    Principles, which were guidelines for American businesses doing business in
                    South Africa during the period of apartheid, which were very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was essentially that, if they met these principles,
                        like giving equal opportunity and all this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: And equal treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, equal treatment. They were very good. In fact, they
                        became almost an anathema to some of the peoplthe absolutists, who didn't
                        want us to have anything to do with apartheid.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>WILSON: He basically insisted on corporate America assuming some social
                    responsibility for its actions in South Africa if it hoped to continue to
                    operate there with a regime that was essentially discriminating on the basis of
                    color against the majority of its population. It was pretty successful. It was a
                    good compromise between those who would say, “Disinvest completely,” and those
                    who would say either, “Business is business. What are you doing mucking about in
                    the business of business?” or those who would say that it's important for
                    American business to remain engaged. He made the case that American business
                    ought to remain engaged, but should comply with some the principles. Sullivan
                    was a big man, six three, with a big ego; he had all of the classic attributes
                    of a good black preacher. He was a stem winder; he could get on a roll. He'd get
                    people saying, “Hallelujah. God praise,” and such responses. He was great. He
                    was wonderful to watch, and a lot of fun. When he came to the AfricaAmerican
                    Summit, he brought the top people of the civil rights movement with him. We
                    decided we were going to host this reception for the Americans, and we did.</p>
                <p>I have to say there are some experiences in life that are really meaningful. At
                    that time we had a living room which was below the entrance, so there was a
                    little balcony which looked down into the living room. After having been in the
                    receiving line for our guests on that balcony, I remember looking down at my
                    living room, seeing Jesse Jackson anLouis Farrakhan with his harehe had a bunch
                    of ladies with hiand Cecily Tyson and Mrs. King and Lewis Sullivan, the former
                    HHS Secretary, and Joe Lowry, who was head of the Southern Baptist grouI can't
                    remember what it was called noand Dorothy Hite from the National Negro Women's
                    Association. Everybody who had been involved in the civil rights movement was
                    sitting down there having drinks in my living room. Andy Young was there; they
                    were all there; everybody that you could possibly imagine was there. So it was
                    quite an event. In the end about 1,200 Americans showed up; many were
                    businessmen who Leon had put the hammerlock on. He was a member of the General
                    Motors Board of Directors and was active in getting American businesses involved
                    in helping disadvantaged youth and working basically in ghettos. He was really
                    good. He was far more subtle than Jesse Jackson in shaking down the business
                    community on behalf of the African American community. He was very good at what
                    he did. Sullivan had advertised this meeting in all the black churches in the
                    States. There were 1,000 African Americans who took this opportunity to come
                    back and see the land of their roots. They were just wonderful souls who really
                    wanted to see Africa because they knew that their ancestors had come from there.
                    We had the leadership of the African American community; so it was a great mix
                    of people. We had invited about 600 people to our house. We hadn't invited
                    Farrakhan because we didn't know that he was coming to the event, but Farrakhan
                    arrived in Gabon. His chief of staff came to see me, a big guy, thiccould play
                    defensive tackle, strong looking...</p>

                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, no doubt. He said, “Look, Farrakhan's noticed that you're having
                    this cocktail party tonight and you hadn't invited him.” I said, “With all due
                    respect to Mr. Farrakhan, we didn't invite him because we didn't know he was
                    coming, one, and by the time we had realized he was coming, we had 660 people
                    invited to the house already and frankly, if it rains, we don't know what we're
                    going to do with them. But I'll tell you what. If Farrakhan came with his
                    entourage of 40 people, I can't possible accommodate all 40 people, but if
                    Minister Farrakhan and maybe one or two others would like to come, we'd be more
                    than happy to have them.” He said, “That's just fine. It'll be just Farrakhan
                    and his wife and myself.” I said, “Sure, no problem.” When the time came for the
                    reception. Farrakhan shows up with his entire harem. He had literally 40 women
                    with him; so we had all 40 of them in. The Angolan ambassador was the dean of
                    the diplomatic corps; I'd been dealing with the Angolans for years on their war
                    and I had met the Angolan ambassadoWe didn't have diplomatic relations with
                    Angola at the time, but I had met the ambassador on the airplane coming in, and
                    we had chatted and got along real well. So I invited him to the reception, and
                    he showed up with nine ministers. This kind of busted the constraints.
                    Fortunately it didn't rain.</p>
                <p>Leon Sullivan, Bongo and I had worked through this reception. I had also managed
                    to have Assistant Secretary George Moose, to come. I told Bongo, “Well, look, we
                    have this conference, and you're going to chair the conference, but the night
                    beforwe've got our assistant secretary cominit would be a great opportunity for
                    you to have a chat with him. Rather than do it in your office, why don't you
                    come up to the house for dinner,” and he agreed. When you host a chief of state,
                    it means that have to have the protocol people there, as well as the food
                    tasters and the security people; you get everybody up there. They're checking
                    the seating arrangements. They're trying to make sure everything happens right.
                    Some get into a fight with your wife over who's going to sit where, how this is
                    going to be served, what's going on, but it all worked out. It was the first
                    time that Bongo in his entire tenure as president had left the president's
                    mansion to eat at a diplomat's residence. As he told Moose “You know, I'm doing
                    this not just because I want to meet you but because Wilson and I get along just
                    fine; we have a good working relationship and it's very useful.”</p>
                <p>In fact, it was beginning to bear fruit. We got permission to have some oil
                    companies work in Gabon. We had gotten democratic and republican democracy
                    institutes and other prdemocracy to work with the Gabonese on the planning of
                    the elections. Things were going along pretty well, so the Summit worked out
                    pretty well. Needless to say, it drove the French ambassador right around the
                    bend. The French were real nervous about me anyway. I had a French wife; I spoke
                    very good French, and I was pretty close to Bongo and we were starting to see
                    the results. The French could see that their interests were being disadvantaged
                    by this new American ambassador who would talk to them like they talk to each
                    other. I wasn't intimidated by the French in any way and wasn't going to be
                    subservient to the French.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>All of this is happening as Central Africa is going through its election cycle.
                    They were having elections in Bangui, they were having elections in the
                    Cameroon. The American ambassadors in both places were very high profile, very
                    vocal and very zealous in their commitment to seeing change. The ambassador to
                    Cameroon was Frances Cook. Cameroon is a bilingual country, and she had been
                    successfully branded by the French as being for the English candidate. The
                    French were not going to allow the English candidate, to win. In the process of
                    assuring that John Frundi would be defeated, the French also managed to get our
                    ambassador on the cover of Jeune Afrique as the bane of everybody's existence in
                    Cameroon. Our ambassador to CAR, Dan Simpson, had been so adamant in his
                    opposition to the incumbent that when he left there was actually a tickertape
                    parade given by all of the opposition supporters who cheered him on his way to
                    the airpormuch again because the French had supported the incumbent. They had
                    felt that Dan had been mucking about trying to change for just the sake of
                    change and that that was undermining their security interest. All of this goes
                    back to our perception of democratizatioquite apart from our rather parochial
                    commercial interests which are not big even for the French in the grand scheme
                    of things. The French trading relationship with Africa only amount to about
                    three percent of their overall trade. In Gabon, unlike Cameroon and Central
                    African Republic, it's an important component, but nonetheless it is still
                    pretty small potatoes compared to the broader picture that we wanted to paint in
                    both Paris and Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>The difference philosophically was how much instability could you countenance for
                    the sake of democracin other words, should you support only a structured move to
                    democracy or would an unstructured move to democracy be acceptable? The French
                    put a premium on security. They wanted democracy, but they didn't want
                    instability caused by moves toward democracy because the their own nationals
                    there, they had economic interests, they had history. They knew that their
                    troops were going to have to deploy in the event of instability, as ultimately
                    they did in CAR. We, on the other hand, had very little at stake there and we
                    had a rather unsophisticated sense of what we should be doing. For us it was
                    democracy and who cares what the consequences are? In Gabon as they moved
                    towards election, we took the position that we were going to be faithful to a
                    process and not allow ourselves to be dragged into the partisan bickering. We
                    took the position, as told Bongo and everybody else who would listen from the
                    very beginning including the French ambassador, that we didn't care who won or
                    lost so long as the process was transparent and permitted all Gabonese the
                    opportunity to express their wishes. We also, during the run up to the election,
                    did something that hadn't been tried either in Gabon or anywhere else up to that
                    time. We actually had quarterly dinners with heads of all the partieabout 12,
                    15. I talked to Bongo about this before I did it. I said, “Look, it strikes me
                    as I look out at your system that you've got this relatively new national
                    assembly. You've made a transition from a one party to a multiparty system, but
                    your politicians don't really talk to each other except in the rather formal
                    well of the national assembly. They don't go and have a beer afterwards
                    together. You know, Ronald Reagan used to always say that from nine to five he
                    was a staunch Republic and was going to fight Tip O'Neill every step of the way,
                    but after five o'clock they were just a couple of old Irish Americans who could
                    just sit down and have a drink and talk about things. That's the way we do
                    politics. A lot of it, at least in the old days, was behind closed doors or
                    after hours when you could sort of make deals and reach compromises. So,” I
                    said, “this is what I want to do”i.e. give the dinner parties. He said, “Yes,
                    that sounds like a good idea.” So I actually talked to Bongo about this, not
                    that I gave him a veto over it, but I figured it was useful to inform him so
                    there would no question that somehow the American ambassador was engaged in some
                    nefarious activit“Interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country”
                    is how it's usually described. So we did these dinners. We would put people
                    together and I'd stand up at the beginning of the dinner and say, “You guys
                    understand that anything goes except for physical violence. I'm bigger than all
                    of you, so if your passions get to the point where you're going to be physically
                    violent, understand that I will step in.” Then we would sit down and have a nice
                    dinner. We had just enough Americans. We had maybe five tables with an American
                    at each table; the rest of the people at each table would be Gabonese of
                    different political persuasions. It was great. They would get to know each other
                    personally. They would spend a half hour talking politics and then an hour and a
                    half talking about their cultural differences, because all parties were
                    essentially ethnically based and geographically based. So they had different
                    cultural experiences. The forests or the sea would mean different things to
                    different ones. The intermarriage between the Fang and the Bateke was a
                    different experience for the Fangs than it was for the Batekes, for example. We
                    would talk through all this. It worked pretty well. That helped us to have good
                    relations with all political parties. We had facilitated their contacts with
                    each other, and put us in the position in the run up to the election to have
                    good contacts across the board.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>Again, the French viewed our activity quite negatively. The French ambassador had
                    been there for 12 years, was broadly thought to have had a relationship with one
                    of Bongo's daughters which had resulted in an offspring, and therefore everybody
                    called him Bongo's son in law. Whether that was true or not I don't know, but it
                    was very clear that, as pro consul basically, his relationship was with Bongo
                    and with nobody else.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>The election was in December. The African American Summit had been in April or
                    May of that year. By April, the French had taken my measure and they didn't like
                    what they saw. They were real worried. During the presidential election
                    campaign, the French ambassador decided that he was going to try to capitalize
                    on the paranoia running through the palace. That his is not just the Gabonese
                    trait, but I think most if not all executives are going to be paranoid during
                    any election campaign. That's just part of politics. So the French ambassador
                    decided that he was going to play on this paranoia to try and assert, as his
                    colleagues in the Central African Republic and Cameroon had done, that somehow
                    the United States was tied to the opposition. H did that, and as the campaign
                    became more heated, the government press started talking about how the American
                    ambassador was favoring the opposition. The opposition had a radio station which
                    the Gabonese press was saying, from gossip planted by the French ambassador, had
                    been financed or donated by the American ambassador. They decided that they
                    would go after me personally, not just our policies, because they figured if
                    they could got rid of me, then they wouldn't have to worry. At one point the
                    French ambassador called me up and he saithis was in October, I guess, October
                    or Novembe“We need to talk.” I said, “Fine, no problem.” He said, “Can I come
                    over to your office?” I said, “No, why don't you come over for breakfast? Why
                    don't you just come over to the house?” He said, “No, I don't want to come up.
                    Why don't you come down?” I said, “Fine, I'll come down.” He was on the beach; I
                    was up on the mountain. I went down for breakfasa great French breakfast,
                    croissants, good French coffee, the whole bit. During the breakfast he said,
                    “You know, this radio station is broadcasting sort of hate messages against
                    French citizens, and my French citizens here are getting very nervous. They turn
                    on this radio station and the radio station says, 'Go out and kill the French
                    people.' You finance this radio station. You support this radio station. Can you
                    do something to stop this?” I said, “First of all, let me be very clear. We
                    haven't financed it, and we don't support it. We deplore those sort of messages,
                    and we tell them that every time we see them. Be under no illusions that somehow
                    we're involved in this. We don't like it any more than you do. We will continue
                    to tell them that, as we know you will also.” Then we moved on to other
                    subjects. I went back to my office to summarize this conversation. I wrote a
                    little report to Washington saying what had happened; I also informed our
                    embassy in Pariour Africa watcher in Paris. I said, “This is what the French
                    ambassador asked me, and this is what I said,” and then left it at that.
                    Commented that the breakfast was good. “Maybe the French had another agenda, but
                    clearly they're worried about their citizens,” etc. The French ambassador wrote
                    a report on this breakfast in which he said, “At his offices I met with the
                    American ambassador today, and he admitted that they had financed and supported
                    this opposition radio station,” etc. In Paris the official who ran African
                    affairs and the Elys�e was essentially the presidenAfrica was sort of the
                    president's fiefdom, so it was his office of African Affairs...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Mitterrand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>WILSON: This was Mitterrand. It was his office that really counted when it came
                    to African policies and issues. When I was in Paris, I would go see the French
                    foreign ministry as a courtesy, but when I really wanted to do business or when
                    they wanted to do business, they would send somebody from the Elys�e, the
                    presidential office, to see me or I would go see them. I had pretty good
                    relations with the guy who handled Africa at the Elys�e; he had good relations
                    with our Africa watcher. Gabon was important to the French, so we would get a
                    lot of attention. The two cables about breakfast went to Paris. The presidential
                    aide and our Africa watcher got together and compared them. The presidential
                    aidGod bless hibought my version. As it played ouand it was later reported in a
                    French newspaper called Levin Manu Judene that this exchange had happenethey had
                    taken a look at the cables, and after the Gabonese elections, the French
                    ambassador went to Paris in part to see the presidential aide. There was a third
                    party present at this meeting and I understand that the ambassador was accused
                    of lying in his report. That was actually borne out in April of the following
                    year, four or five months after the election, when French ambassador, who
                    described himself as 'un grand ambassadeur,' a great ambassador, a very senior
                    ambassador, was given his onward assignment. After 12 years in Gabon, a plumb
                    assignment for senior French diplomats, he was assigned to Albania as
                    ambassador. I took great delight in calling Washington on a phone which was
                    clearly tapped by the French and saying in special English how the French
                    ambassador had just gotten his just desserts by being assigned to Tirana,
                    Albania, as ambassador. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Back to the run up to
                    the elections. The French ambassador is trying to put the fix in to make sure
                    that Bongo wins and also to make sure that the relationship between the United
                    States and Gabon suffers as a consequence of my relationship with both Gabon and
                    Bongo. IFES had come through, and IFES at that time was peddling a...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: IFES is the International Foundation for Electoral Systems; they have
                    developed a wonderful data bank on how elections are run, what goes into running
                    elections, what an electoral law ought to look like, who ought to be
                    responsible, what sort of commissions ought to be in power to run them, what the
                    adjudication process ithe whole nuts to bolts on elections; they do a very good
                    job. At that time they were peddling something that was anathema to French
                    systems. They were pushing for an independent electoral commission. The French
                    all believeand Charles Pasqua was the minister of interior, a very powerful man
                    in French politiche started from selling Perno, which is their licorice drink,
                    to being one of the most powerful men in French politics...</p>

                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>WILSON: Speaks with this great southern Marseilles accent. He was a Corsicaa very
                    interesting character. He had been minister of interior a number of times. In
                    fact, I showed up in French intelligence files in the mid 1980s when he was
                    minister of interior as an intelligence agent. I was then the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission in Burundi. The French had it wrong. They didn't understand that CIA
                    employees don't make it to deputy chief of mission; that is just not our system.
                    But anyway that was all right. Being an intelligence agent was something I
                    always liked. I take my martini stirred not shaken.</p>
                <p>IFES came out and met with the Gabonese minister of interior who's saying, “This
                    is our responsibility to run the election,” while IFES is saying, “No, you've
                    really got to have this independent electoral commission. It should be taken out
                    of the government's hands.” In the end it's still an ongoing debate, and there
                    are problems associated with both systems, so I'm not sure who has the ultimate
                    wisdom on this issue, but that was the debate that was going on. Then we had
                    NDI, the National Democratic Institute, comes in; they're the ones who kind of
                    put together election observer teams. They came in and took a look at how the
                    election was being organized. They determine whether or not it's going to lead
                    to a free, fair and transparent election and whether it's the sort of election
                    they can support. If they determine they can, they write a report, and then they
                    put together an observer team that observes the elections and essentially
                    certify their validity. NDI also had some problems. They sent a kid out who was
                    maybe 22 years old, looked 14, had maybe voted in one election in his lifetime;
                    so young that he probably had never shaved in his lifetime. I took him to see
                    Bongo and some of the barons in Bongo's party; it was clear to me this was like
                    feeding meat to the sharkthis poor kid. The barons had been running Gabonese
                    politics for 30 years; you can say a lot of things about Bongo, but the one
                    thing you have to acknowledge is that he is political animal from the top of his
                    head to the tips of his fingers. He knows every Gabonese in his country. He
                    knows what he has to do to get their vote. He could win any election going away.
                    This is not a guy who in his political years throws people in jail or kills
                    them. He does have a history of going after his first wife's lovers, that's
                    true, and there was some history in his youth of some rather oppressive measures
                    being taken, but it was related primarily to family love affairmore than it was
                    against his political enemies. Most of his political enemies were still around,
                    were still doing very well, thank you, and were still his political enemies or
                    they had become his political allies. Bongo knew the Gabonese political scene.
                    He had mastered it, and the guys around him had mastered it. These were the guys
                    who had bilked the World Bank of over a billion dollars in the construction of
                    the train track from Libreville to Franceville. It started out as a billion
                    dollars and then got to be a $4,000,000,000 project and the $1,000,000,000
                    disappeared. So these guys were masters of their own destiny. We send a kid out
                    there to tell them about democracAmerican style. It was unfair to the young man;
                    it was unfair to the Gabonese. It was not serious exercise on our part.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>In any case, the NDI team went back and wrote its report; somebody in their
                    office leaked the draft report and sent it out to the Gabonese. These guys
                    probably thought that the Gabonese were honorable people. As a consequence,
                    honorable people don't read each other's mail. But this was a Gabonese regime
                    that was intent on reelecting itself. They were going to do just like any other
                    campaign did; they were running hard for election. They also had some good help
                    from the French. They found somebody in NDI's offices who sent them a copy of
                    the report which said, among other things, that “the diminutive Omar Bongo
                    stands five foot four and wears high heeled shoes,”something you just don't say
                    about a chief of state in a serious report that is designed to frame an
                    election. Then they also said the constitutional court, which is the body that
                    adjudicates the election returns, was headed by Bongo's wife, which it wasn't.
                    In fact, I think the head of the court was a very accomplished jurist. She had
                    very close ties to Bongo; she may have had his children, but she was not his
                    wife. It was factually incorrect. Needless to say, this report just added fuel
                    to the fire. It was said that the Americans obviously wanted Bongo gone and that
                    Joe Wilson was the one who escorted NDI in to see Bongo; therefore, he's
                    responsible for this. Clearly NDI was disqualified and another group had to be
                    hammered together. The African American Institute came in, and put together an
                    election report.</p>
                <p>The elections took placIt was very close. There were three candidates. One was a
                    Fang candidate from the north, and they have the largest plurality of the
                    population. They have about 35 or 40 percent of the country. Bateke live in the
                    south and the southeast, principally the southeast and the inland. That was
                    Bongo's group. They had about 35%. Basically in Gabonese politics there are the
                    Fangs and then everybody else, who got 35% or 40% of the vote. There was a third
                    group which lived along the coast and it had its own candidate. They were the
                    swing vote. In the first round they're going to vote for their own candidate,
                    getting maybe 20 percent of the vote. That was the way it looked before the
                    elections with Bongo slightly ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>The French could not abide, and Bongo himself could not abide, the idea that he
                    would not be reelected in the first round. The French ambassador commented to
                    me, in an inadvertent moment, that neither the French nor the Gabonese could
                    afford a second round. I think that was right. I think ultimately that they were
                    afraid that, if they didn't win the election in the first round, they would have
                    trouble keeping it all together in the second round. I think frankly that if the
                    Mienay would have thrown their weight behind Bongo, that he would have won in
                    the second round. The Gabonese did not share that view. So they decided that
                    they weren't going to allow a second round to take place. At 12:30 at night the
                    chief justice of the constitutional court announce that 51.17 percent of the
                    vote went for Omar Bongo, who therefore was declared the victor in the first
                    round. The opposition just went bananas; the were not happy. They take to the
                    streets and rioted. The Gabonese minister of defense, who was Bongo's cousin,
                    decided to deploy his troops. He took his artillery pieces out and he shelled
                    the opposition radio station and the opposition leader's house. There were riots
                    in the streets; the Gabonese trashed and burned and overturned cars belonging to
                    foreigners in particular; and then dragged some of them out and beat them up.
                    They didn't beat too many up, but they were roughing them up a little bit.</p>
                <p>So we had a security problems on our hands. My house was in an area controlled by
                    the opposition. The opposition had for a long time decided that they were going
                    to play street theater in front of the American ambassador's house. They would
                    start all their riots right in front of my house so that the American ambassador
                    would see what was going on. A person was killed in front of our house. I think
                    we had two people killed in front of our house. It got pretty nasty. We couldn't
                    go in and out; so we ultimately moved. In the aftermath of the election, this is
                    what's going on. We held a meeting and decided that at a minimum, since we still
                    had to move around the town, to give it some measure of protection. Since nobody
                    was really mad at the Americans, we flew the American flag in our cars. We put
                    flags up on all the windows of our private vehicles. We gave everybody a flag,
                    and we put flags on the official vehicles. We would drive through the city and
                    people would come up to the car in a threatening way; then somebody would say,
                    “No, no, look, there's the American flag. These are Americans.” People would
                    applaud and we would be able to drive on. It was great. It was so great, in
                    fact, that the French ambassador complaint to Bongo and said, “These Americanin
                    addition to everything elshave put American flags in their cars so that they
                    wouldn't get hurt.”</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>At some time during this period, I had to see Bongo about to complain about the
                    shelling of the radio station. I told him, I said in no uncertain terms, “You
                    know, you didn't like what the radio station said. I didn't either. But, you
                    know, when you've got a legal problem, you don't send the army to deal with it.
                    You send your attorney general, you send your lawyers. Go arrest the station
                    managers. Put them out of business through the legal system. You don't send your
                    army there to shell them. That was really a stupid thing to do.” I was really
                    blunt with him. I was coming down with hepatitis, so I wasn't really feeling
                    real well at the time. My eyes were all orange, and my face was orange. So I'm
                    in there talking to him and he says to me, “You know, the French ambassador was
                    just in here and told me that you guys put American flags in your cars. What's
                    this?” I leaned forward and I said, “Look, Mr. President, my first
                    responsibility is the safety and security of my citizens who are living here in
                    Gabon. I know you share the concern that no foreigner should harmed on Gabonese
                    soil. It would look bad for you, it would look bad for me. It would be really be
                    bad for the people who were injured. We did fly the American flag. We decided
                    that we would do everything we could to enhance our own security. We put
                    American flags on our cars, and you know what? It worked. If the French
                    ambassador has a problem with that, I suggest you tell him to give me a call,
                    because I've got a lot of American flags in my warehouse and I'd be more than
                    happy to give him a bunch of them to put on his cars as well.” That was the last
                    I ever heard about that one.</p>
                <p>We had the odd presidential candidatnot the major presidential candidate but one
                    of the minor presidential candidatewho showed up on our doorstep one night
                    asserting that he has been chased by the Gabonese forces and was seeking refuge.
                    We invited him in, talked to him and then sent him on his way. Of course, the
                    press published the story that we had harbored the main presidential
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>I'm came down with hepatitis at this time. I was really sick. I went to see the
                    doctor, who said “Your liver count is really off the charts. We should evacuate
                    you.” The situation in Gabon was calming down a bit, but it was all happening
                    the press. The press was trashing me and trashing the Americans, and I'm sick as
                    a dog. I said, “All right. There's not much more I can do anyway. I might as
                    well go and get well.” I took an Air France flight to Paris, checked into the
                    American hospital for a couple days, and spent about 10 days just getting well.
                    Hepatitis is one of the maladies that limit you to just sleep; it changes your
                    appetite because your body needs certain nutrients. I would wake up every four
                    hours or so and I would eat a half a dozen oranges and then go back to sleep for
                    another four hours; wake up for 30 minutes and eat another half a dozen oranges
                    and then go back to sleep for four hours. I did this for about 10 days or
                    something like that. Even though we had left on the commercial flight as quietly
                    as possiblwe hadn't really said anything to anybodthe Gabonese press on day
                    following our departure accused me of fleeing the country. They had some
                    horrible picture that somebody had taken several months before on which I looked
                    like a deer in headlights.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>I'm in Paris cooling my heels getting well, thinking about what my next steps
                    might be. I got well and I flew back to Gabon. According to the Gabonese press I
                    was never coming back, and there I was again. The first thing I did was to call
                    the president, telling him that I've got to see him. I went to see him and I sat
                    down with him. I had a couple of the old newspapers with me, and I said, “You
                    know, if you really think that you will win by doing this, you're wrong. First
                    of all, if you want to martyr the American ambassador, that's fine, but you
                    understand that you make me a hero in my own Department and in the U.S.
                    government. You don't win there. You make yourself look bad, and that's pretty
                    silly. Secondly, you and I have known each other for quite a while now. I've
                    broken bread at your house, you've broken bread at mine, and we've been pretty
                    frank with each other. You know, there are some people around here who have been
                    saying things that are just simply not true,” and I went through chapter and
                    verse of some of these items. I said, “Frankly, between two people who know each
                    other as well as you and I know each other, and who have broken bread
                    togethethat's important, to break bread togetheit is really dishonorable to do
                    this.” Then I said a couple of other things and then left. The offending person
                    who had been the viper in all of this was fired the next day, and our
                    relationship got back on track. That relationship was very, very helpful. We
                    managed to avoid the real estrangement that we had seen in other bilateral
                    relationships as a consequence of presidential elections that were less than
                    peripherally successful. The reason I took this tact rather than the tact that
                    we had taken in Togo or Cameroon or in the Central African Republic is that our
                    bilateral relationship was built on more than just whether or not a presidential
                    election was successful or not. We had to compartmentalize this part of it. This
                    was not the be all and the end all.</p>
                <p>Secondly, even in terms of democratization, it's important to understand that
                    presidential elections are the culmination of the democratic process, not the
                    beginning, but we in our approach to democratization see presidential elections
                    as everythinthe beginning, the end, and everything in between. The foundations
                    of democracy are based on what goes on in localities and communities and
                    everything up to presidential elections. We do ourselves and our friends in
                    Africa a great disservice when we put all of our eggs in the presidential
                    election basket. I was bound and determined not to do that. I made a lot of
                    enemies in Washington for not doing this, but at the end of the day we still had
                    to do business with Gabon. They were very active in the Angolan peace process.
                    They've proven themselves to be active in the Congo, in Chad and in CAR in
                    positive ways. It was important not to deny the lack of transparency in the
                    presidential election but to put it in its proper context. To this day, if you
                    take a look around Africa, Bongo is still the most adroit and the best
                    politician on the continena man who knows his country better than anybody else.
                    He also has the luxury of having a lot of liquidity so that he can spread the
                    money around as inducements. So we got through the election.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been in 1993?</hi>

                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>WILSON: This was the end of 1993. We got rid of the French ambassador in 1994.
                    His successor came just on the eve of the Gabonese National Day, which is
                    August, and he presented his letters. He didn't know Africa very well; he was
                    prissy, and Bongo didn't like prisses very much. He likes manly sort of men. The
                    French ambassador had not received his invitation to the National Day
                    celebration in a format that met his requirements under his understanding of
                    what protocol should have been. I think he received a phone call instead of an
                    engraved invitation. So on National Day he was seen downtown eating a pizza in
                    some local pizzeria while everybody else was at the palace celebrating National
                    Day with the president.</p>
                <p>For this particular National Day, Peter Krough from Georgetown University just
                    happened to be in town; he came with us to the festivities. We had a table with
                    Africans. We always made a point of sitting with the Gabonese, not with the
                    diplomatic corps. We made that almost sort of a condition; we would go in and we
                    would sit with our Gabonese friends. We had this table; there were hundreds of
                    people at this reception in the palace. Bongo and his wife were at the head
                    table. There came a point when there was a pregnant pause between one dish and
                    the next coursin this case between the main dish and the dessert. There was a
                    lull in the conversation while everybody was kind of looking around wondering
                    what was going to happen next. In this lull, Bongo called somebody over, raising
                    the question in everybody's mind about what's Bongo was doing. He called over
                    this guy and whispered something to him. Everybody was watchinBongo's up at the
                    head table and everybody's down below. This guy walked all the way around and
                    down, and came to our table and whispered to me. He said, “The president would
                    like to speak to you.” I said, “Fine.” I got up and I excused myself from my
                    guests, and walked all the way back through the people, back around behind the
                    end of the table, and out the back door. By this time everybody's intrigued.
                    There was just silence. I said hundredthere were thousands of people at this
                    dinner. After we gone out, Bongo got up and he walked out as well. He and I just
                    sat out in the back and had a little chat. The issue was most ridiculous; it had
                    to do with a money laundering scheme, but Bongo wanted to talk to me about it.
                    It had nothing to do with any substance; he could have called me anytime and
                    talked about substance. In having everybody see that he and I had left the
                    banquet room, he wanted to make a point to the thousands that our relationship
                    was were good and that we were back in good relations. We were out there for the
                    appropriate amount of time; we yuck it up a bit, and then came back in together
                    yucking it up. Bongo went back to the head table and I walked back to my table.
                    For this whole time, thousands of peoplthe elite of Gabonese society and the hoi
                    polloi of diplomatic societwere watching this, while the newly arrived French
                    ambassador, was not there because he was in some pizzeria downtowall because he
                    was pissed off because he didn't get his invitation in the format that he
                    wanted. So it was gag for the French. It was very clear to everybody what Bongo
                    had done; there were no secrets about what Bongo had done. Later that evening,
                    my wife danced with him and I danced with his wife; it was just sort of a real
                    love fest, and that was the signal that was sent. We then did a lot of
                    interesting things together. For example, the Equatorial Guinean president,
                    Obiang, was having some problem with his opposition, so he was coming to see
                    Bongo. He was having lots of trouble with the American ambassador in Malabo.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Somebody from the palace called me up and said, “Bongo is receiving the president
                    of Equatorial Guinea this afternoon. Is there anything you want him to say?” I
                    said, “I wish I had known. I could have given the president a paper on American
                    complaints about the way the president of Equatorial Guinea was acting towards
                    his population. But on such short notice, I don't have much. He can say whatever
                    he wants. But he should know that we have some human rights concerns in that
                    country.” I left it at that and went back to my business; 10 minutes later I got
                    another call from the palace saying, “Bongo wants to know if you'd like to come
                    over and tell President Obiang yourself.” I said, “Let me talk to Washington.
                    I'll get back to you. It's somebody else's turf and I don't want to be poaching
                    on his turf.” So I called up Washington and talked to Bob Pringle, who said,
                    “Yes, sounds good. Why don't you go over there. Go on over there. You know what
                    to tell him.” So I called the palace back up and said, “Sure, I'll come over.
                    Tell me what time. I'll be over there.” They said, “Sure. We'll get back to
                    you.” I got a call back from Bongo's daughter, who's is director of the cabinet.
                    She said, “Fine, the president would like you to come to dinner, you and your
                    wife, at his private residence. It will just be the president, his wife, and
                    myself and their foreign ministejust a very small dinner.” I said, “Look, I'm
                    under instructions to tell Obiang what we think of him and his regime, but I
                    don't really want to break bread with the man if I don't have to. I don't want
                    to have a meal with this guy. This guy's a thug.” She says, “Okay, got it.” Ten
                    minutes later I got a call from the chief of protocol at the residency; he was a
                    general. Now, a general in the Gabonese army is maybe not a real general like
                    Colin Powell, but they have a certain general bearing. He gets on the phone and
                    says, “Monsieur l'Ambassadeur [French; Mr. Ambassador],” and I said, “Oui, Mon
                    General [French: Yes, General].” He said, “The president will receive you at his
                    residence with Mrs. Wilson for dinner at 8:30,” or “You will arrive at 8:30. You
                    will have your meeting with the president and the president of Equatorial
                    Guinea, and your wife will arrive at nine for dinner with the president and his
                    wife and the president of Equatorial Guinea and his wife.” I said, “Oui, Mon
                    General.” There it was. I been given my instructions.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>I took my junior officefirst tour officewith me. His name was Greg Thome and he
                    was a very fine officer. I figured that if were to talk to Obiang, that would be
                    good fun for him; it would be a good experience. He could be the note takeI
                    wouldn't have to remember anything or write anything down myself. So we go over
                    there. We showed up at eight o'clock, and there was President Bongo, President
                    Obiang, the Prime Minister Oemba, myself and my note taker. We go to sit out on
                    the porcthe patithe palace had a swimming pool. Bongo and I follow Obiang. The
                    prime minister doesn't say anything, and my note taker is sitting there just
                    taking notes. Bongo hits Obiang high, I hit him low, and we do this for about 45
                    minutes. We're talking to him about these human rights problems, about how he
                    treats his people, about what's going on there and what he ought to do. Bongo
                    finally said to him, “What you need to do is have a government of national
                    unity. Bring other people in, teach them how to govern so that they will at
                    least have some experience for down the road, and then you'll be able to divide
                    and rule; you'll be able to coopt.” As I said, we talked to Obiang for about 45
                    minutes. Then time came to have dinner and I sent the junior officer home. We go
                    in and we sit down. During the course of the dinner the Equatorial Guinean
                    foreign minister was sitting next to me; he told me about the issues he has had
                    with our ambassador, an officer by the name of John Bennett. He said that our
                    ambassador went jogging in the middle of the night, that he carried a gun in the
                    waistband of his jogging shorts, which, by the way, were “way too short.” He
                    jogged through the part of town where the women of dubious moral fiber lurked,
                    and that was just not acceptable to the Guineans. There was a litany of
                    complaints.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>If you want to know anything about Equatorial Guinea, the best book ever written
                    on that country was called Tropical Gangsters. It is a wonderful book written by
                    a former World Bank representative who was there; you get the feel, the odors,
                    just the sense of what that a society was at that time. It has changed because
                    they found oil since then, but in those days it was just kind of corrupt and
                    backwards. Obiang's predecessor had literally taken cash from his capital and
                    had buried it at his village. Of course, all the cash was in paper, and it
                    rained and all the paper just rotted. When Obiang came to power, they took this
                    guy Nguema out and strung him up. I guess they had had the trial in the downtown
                    stadium, and then they strung him up at sundown. We have had really a checkered
                    history in Equatorial Guinea. We had had an embassy there with two people. We
                    had a charg� d'affaires and a communicator and their wives; the charg�
                    d'affaires was having an affair with the communicator, which went sour and the
                    charg� d'affaires stabbed him in the communications vault. There was a shortwave
                    radio system that linked all embassies; this whole thing had been on the radio,
                    so that everybody up and down the coast from Liberia to Gabon or Congo had been
                    able to hear this argument and the stabbings that followed. This was in the
                    early 1970s; this was long before we got to Gabon. Obiang came from a strange
                    clan. He was the nephew of the guy who'd taken all the money and buried it in
                    his village. In any case, we had this nice dinner and the Guineans are telling
                    me how weird our ambassador was. After dinner Obiang and Bongo started to walk
                    towards the swimming pool; I figured that they were just going to have a little
                    t�te � t�te; I hung back talking to the president's daughter. The two presidents
                    got about halfway out to the swimming pool when Bongo looked around for me. He
                    signaled me to come over with him. I went and joined them; the two of us spent
                    another 45 minutes going after Obiang. Obiang and I to this day remain good
                    friends. It was great fun. Obiang returned to Equatorial Guinea, didn't do what
                    Bongo suggesteat that time these guys had no money but Bongo volunteered to help
                    with the financeand Bongo was pissed for the whole remainder of my tour. Every
                    couple of months he would remind me of that meeting we had with Obiang and how
                    Obiang had not taken his advice. He was not happy about that. That was the sort
                    of relationship we had.</p>
                <p>Bongo got himself into a little bit of trouble. There was a French tailor by the
                    name of Smalta who catered to the rich guythe sheikh typein the Gulf, along
                    North Africa and through Africa, providing them with suits. When he came to
                    measure the clients and later to deliver the suits, he would also bring a bunch
                    of high class Parisian and European hookers to service them on what other needs
                    they might have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a service industry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>WILSON: This was a service industry; that's right. Smalta was picked up by the
                    French police for pimping or whatever the legal term is; he had files on all his
                    clients including Bongo. When he went to trial, the hookers testified that Bongo
                    never paid them; they were all mad at Bongo because he didn't pay. Bongo took
                    great umbrage at that because they had singled him out. The police had combed
                    through the files on the Gulf clients and the North Africans, but had singled
                    out the one on Bongo. Bongo felt that that was really racist on their parthe way
                    that they treated him. When this whole affair broke in the newspapers, I was in
                    Port Gentil at the time, which is a coastal town. I was there talking to some of
                    our oil companies. I came back on a Sunday afternoon. I called Bongo at home and
                    said, “I just heard about this story breaking in the newspaper, and I just
                    wanted to call you as somebody who has been a friend of yours for a couple years
                    and just say how sorry I am that this sort of trash is bandied about the French
                    newspapers.” Of course, I enjoyed giving a few digs to the French; I was the
                    only diplomat to call him up. The French ambassador wouldn't do that. So that
                    was a good move on my part. The problem with Smalta was the way the French
                    judicial system handled it. It gave me an opportunity of getting a dig in at the
                    French free of charge. I pointed out to Bongo the next day that that was yet
                    another reason why he should buy his suits from the United States instead from
                    these trashy Parisian tailors.</p>
                <p>The French ambassador pulled their ambassador out after only about 16 months. I
                    think he left just about the time I did. They were really worried that they were
                    going to lose everything to us. By this time we had half a dozen oil companies
                    working in Gabon; we were taking oil concessions away from the French right and
                    left and Bongo was being very helpful to us on all these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about these oil concessions? ELF obviously was in
                        there greasing the transactions. This is their modus operandi, but we were
                        now working under the new rules of no corruption, no bribes and all that?
                        How did our oil companies work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Of course, they're not going to tell me if they're bribing anybody in
                    violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but Bongo understood that to be
                    100 percent dependent upon the French was not in his own interest. Before I
                    arrived in Gabon, there was an open bidding round; just before the bids closed,
                    the French had managed to sabotage the process and pick off for themselves the
                    choice concessions that they wanted. ELF had managed to do that. The American
                    oil companies howled in protest. Keith Wauchope, who was my predecessor, had
                    been very aggressive in his defending of the American interests. The French had
                    used that to turn the Gabonese press against him, and the American oil companies
                    had basically been shut out. We were able to turn that around, because, among
                    many reasons, we were able to make clear that it was not in Bongo's interest to
                    be so dependent upon just the French.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>By that time, his relationship with the French had soured in some respects
                    anyway. He didn't like the ambassador. He thought the French hadn't been
                    treating him quite the way he wished. At the time, in France there was the
                    beginning of a debate on their Africa policy. The ministry of finance was
                    beginning to realize that French policies towards Africa were beginning to cost
                    a lot of money. We're getting towards the end of Mitterrand's years. The right
                    was in power and Chirac, who was close to Bongo was the head of the party even
                    if he wasn't prime minister. There were some dislocations within the French
                    governmental system, and Bongo didn't like that very much. He didn't like the
                    fact that they'd taken the French ambassador away and that they'd replaced him
                    with this guy that he just couldn't stand. All that gave us an opportunity to
                    press our case for having American oil companies participate in the development
                    of the oil sector. We obviously were concerned about possible violations of the
                    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We were at a net disadvantage with ELF in head to
                    head competitiovery clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we providing any economic or military
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, Gabon had one of the highest per capita incomes of any country on the
                    continent because of its oil resources; so we were constrained by that fact. We
                    had no development projects. We did have a regional project that was just in its
                    inceptiothe preservation of the rainforest which was to cover Gabon, Cameroon,
                    Central African Republic, Congo (Brazzaville), and maybe Zaire. But that was the
                    only infusion of development assistance we had. There were some relationship in
                    Franceville between CDC and Gabon because there was a research center there that
                    had originally been put there by the French to study the high incidence of
                    infertility in Gabon. The Gabonese population growth rate was very low.
                    Initially they thought it was because of the high incidence in venereal disease
                    that resulted in sterility, but they were examining other possible causes of low
                    fertility rates. The research center then started exploring retro viruses and
                    subsequently HIV AIDS. Gabon had a large primate population and that also
                    interested the CDC. They had a liaison relationship with the institute and had
                    the people working there. That was really about it in terms of a non political
                    relationship, with the exception of a Peace Corps program which had about 120
                    volunteers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was AIDS developing as a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We are now talking about the mid 1990s. Gabon was not publishing
                    statistics that reflected the high incidence of AIDS. It was not as bad there as
                    it was in Burundi or Rwanda, for example, but it was clearly a problem. Gabon
                    was on the northern edge and the western edge of the problem that was, by and
                    large, an eastern and southern one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether, as AIDS became known, it had any
                        effect on the morale or the operation of the embassy, particularly because
                        it was sexually and a blood transmitted disease. You know, you're driving
                        around and you have an accident and blood is needed. Did this cause people
                        to be uneasy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I think people were uneasy. We did everything we could to insure that we
                    had safe blood supplies. We had, for example, lists of potential donors, all of
                    whom were presumed, because they were Americans, to be AIDS and HIV free. We had
                    done everything that we thought that we could to keep the staff safe. We hadn't
                    gotten to the point where we were donating blood for freezing. We didn't have
                    that technology to do, but we did have a list of potential blood donors so that
                    we could...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had our own needles. We had our own health center; we had a doctor, we
                    had a nurse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Peace Corps volunteers up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were up to everything. They were in health, in education; they built
                    schools and roads; they did a little bit of everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French get nervous about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The French had initially used the Peace Corps in its early years as a way
                    of arguing, and had done so in Gabon, that the Peace Corps was really just a CIA
                    operation. In fact, the Peace Corps was thrown out, I think, thanks to the
                    French in the mid 1960s. By the 1990s, that was no longer the case. The Peace
                    Corps was a pretty successful operation. The French, if they didn't like it, at
                    least kept that to themselves. The volunteers were all over the country. It was
                    great; it was a good program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, I think that's about it. After we vanquished the French, it was life
                    in paradise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to note that the French Americans contest is
                        amusing in a way, because we were seen as sort of the enemy in Africa in
                        their trying to take over, where as all we actually wanted was to protect
                        our commercial interest, but our other interests were so minor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I would put it somewhat differently. I would say that the French always
                    perceived us as the enemy, but you're absolutely right. The French were driven
                    in all these places by two things. One was the protection of their population in
                    the African countrietheir population was a constituency. It was there earning a
                    living and didn't want to lose that lucrative living. Then there were the
                    broader commercial interests, and more loosely their political, historic ties
                    and cultural ties. By the end of the day, it was their other former colonies in
                    Africa that give the French a chance to play with the big boys in the
                    international geopolitics arena, either at the UN or elsewhere; they can bring
                    to bear all these voices that nobody else can. Why they saw us as the enemy is
                    not entirely clear. We were only going to operate on the marginhowever many
                    contracts we were ever going to get. It got so bad that even for contracts of
                    less than five or ten million dollars for cell phones, for example, the
                    president of an African country would get a call from the president of France
                    lobbying on behalf of the French company. It was a lot of fun. I've always said
                    that I fought the Cold War where the war was hot down in Africa and where the
                    enemy often spoke French. I have scars diplomatic scars on my back to show for
                    it. But I did not have to go to Tirana, Albania, to atone for my sins.</p>
                <p>Q: We have now covered Gabon. Where were you assigned in 1995?</p>
                <p>WILSON: I went to Stuttgart as political advisor to the Commander in Chief, US
                    Armed Forces, Europe. Stuttgart is in the Schwabian region of Germany, the home
                    of Porsche and Mercedes, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Stuttgart until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was in Stuttgart from 1995 to 1997. As I said, I was the political
                    advisor to the Commander in Chief of U.S. Armed Forces European Command, who is
                    “two hatted” as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. So he is SACEUR, Supreme
                    Allied Commander Europe. His headquarters are in Mons, Belgium, and although I
                    worked for him, I worked at his American headquarters in Vahingen, Germany, just
                    outside of StuttgarPatch Barracks, it's called. My daily point of contact was
                    his deputy, also know as the DCINCEUR, or Deputy Commander in Chief U.S. Armed
                    Forces Europe, DCINCEUR, who was an Air Force four star general by the name of
                    Jim Jamerson. He had been the person who had set up “Operation Provide Comforts”
                    in northern Iraq among other things; so that we had some previous connection
                    over Iraq and the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about what were your principal concerns while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>WILSON: When I arrived at Patch Barracks, we were in the process of focusing on
                    the future role of the European Command. A joint command is responsible for the
                    planning and execution of military operations in its theater. Our command had
                    historically been responsible for defending NATO, defending Western Europor the
                    Fulda Gap as we used to saagainst an invasion by the Warsaw Pact forces. Despite
                    the fact that the Berlin Wall had fallen in 1990 and the Cold War had been over
                    for five years, the bureaucracy, which was our command headquarters, was still
                    focused largely on its responsibilities to defend Western Europe against an
                    enemy which may or may not have gone away by this time. When I got there, we
                    were being obliged to respond to threats from elsewhere in our theater which
                    covered something in the order of 89 countries and 112 embassies, consulates and
                    international missions. We covered all of Europe with the exception of Russia.
                    We covered the Near East up to and including Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “except for Russia,” does that mean that you
                        were covering the Ukraine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's correct. We were running programs in the Baltic, Ukraine, Belarus,
                    etc. The only country with which we did not directly interface with was Russia,
                    and that was because Russian relations were handled by the chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs in Washington. It was a Washington held program. We covered the Near East
                    up to and including Israel, but we did not cover Jordan. Jordan and the Arabian
                    Gulf and Syria were covered by Central Command. We were responsible for Lebanon
                    and Israel, although Israel was also a unique situation because of this
                    historically close relationships between the Pentagon and the Israeli defense
                    forces and between Israel at all levels and the American body politic here in
                    Washington. We covered all of Africa with the exception of the Horn of Africa,
                    from Egypt through the Suez Canal and down around the Horn of Africa; so we had
                    most of the countries of Africa. In the period 1995 to 1997 while I was in
                    Stuttgart, there were a number of very interesting operations. For example, we
                    transitioned from “Operation Provide Comfort” to “Operation Northern Watch” in
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got to explain what “Provide Comfort” was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: “Provide Comfort” was the operation that was designed to restrict Iraqi
                    use of their air assets above the 34th parallel, I think it was, or the 32nd
                    paralleI don't remember. We flew to interdict their flying fixed wing aircraft
                    in that area.</p>
                <p>Q: This was mainly to protect the Kurds?</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>WILSON: It had the effect of protecting the Kurds, but it was essentially just a
                    part of the cease fire. It was an interdiction of use of fixed wing aircraft,
                    and we enforced it. This operation when I first got there in 1995 was operating
                    out of northern Iraq out of a place called Tako, which was a Kurdish support
                    operation; so our air operation insured that the Kurds were not subject to Iraqi
                    air attacks. That, in fact, was the first trip that Jim Jamerson and I took
                    together, to northern Iraq, which was quite interesting.</p>
                <p>We also managed during my tour, the deployment to Bosnia. That was a NATO run
                    operatioNATO Plubut the troops belonged to their respective home nations until
                    they got to Bosnia. We owned the assets from the time that we started
                    identifying and training them until the time that they were turned over to the
                    NATO commander in Bosnia. That meant that all transportation was our
                    requirement, all the training was our requirement, all the transiting of foreign
                    countries on the way to Bosnia was our requirement, and we shared the
                    requirement with NATO for the briefing of the various countries that were going
                    to be involved one way or another. I'll just give you an example because this
                    was an interesting operation. We were going to deploy 20,000 troops. Imagine, if
                    you will, the Commander in Chief U.S. Armed Forces telling the Commander of the
                    Army, “I want you to get 20,000 troops and 300,000 tons of equipment and
                    materiel to Tuzla, Bosnia, by December 20th.” The Army general would say, “Got
                    it. Yes, sir,” and pulls out a map, drawing a straight line from Kaiserslautern,
                    where his troops were training, to Tuzla. He would get ready to march across
                    Europe to get there. In this scenario, we in the political advisor's office
                    would raise our hand and make the point that, “In moving these troops you're
                    going to be moving across a number of sovereign countries, some of which are
                    former Warsaw Pact countries. Perhaps it is in our collective interest to insure
                    that we have prepared the diplomatic groundwork before you go.” That included
                    such things as negotiating status of forces agreements, insuring the all
                    countries understood what might happen, what might not happen, how we would deal
                    with incidents, what would happen if an American fell off a train in a foreign
                    country, who would be responsible for the health and insurance, etc., what would
                    happen if an American in transit got drunk and fired off his weapon, how they
                    would carry their weapons armed across these countrieall these various things
                    that needed to be done and which might occur. As I said, some of these countries
                    were former Warsaw Pact countries and, while they agreed in principle with what
                    we were doing, that didn't mean that they couldn't make some political hay one
                    way or the other over the fact that American forces, which had been arrayed
                    against them for an entire generation, were now going to be transiting their
                    country and setting up behind their linethe lines that they had been manning for
                    34 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>So we set up an operation which I led; we took majors and lieutenant colonels and
                    flew to a number of capitals, from Paris to Bratislava basically and most places
                    in between including Belgrade. We briefed all these countries on our operational
                    plan; we briefed them on our logistics plan, so they understood what we were
                    planning to do and how we were planning to doing it. The level of briefings was
                    at the level requested by the government. We would just say we're going to be
                    there and we're going to brief our embassies, and we will brief you at whatever
                    level you wish to be briefed at. In some countries the level was very high. In
                    Austria we briefed very senior advisors to the prime minister including the
                    minister of interior. In Bratislava we briefed senior political officials who
                    were worried that the opposition was going to accuse them of having sold out to
                    the Americans and basically abandoned 35 or 40 years of principle in doing
                    so.</p>
                <p>In the Czech Republic we briefed the guy who had made the trains run on time when
                    they had separated the assets of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. He
                    had run that operation; he was the one who wanted to take this particular
                    briefing because he was going to be required to make the trains run on time
                    during the transit period. Each one of these countries had different
                    issuedifferent bureaucratic issuethat needed to be resolved, and they had
                    positions that they needed to have considered. We laid the groundwork for all of
                    that. We went to France, because we wanted our friends, the French, to
                    understand precisely what it was that we were doing; this was in the context of
                    a number of other things we were doing with the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Technically this would be the military side of NATO, which
                        France was not in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's correct, but they were in the NATO Plus. They were in the “plus”
                    column; they were part of the political organization and then they offered their
                    troops in this as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go into a certain amount of detail on how
                        something like this happens. Essentially when you were there, was this
                        pulled out of the blue, that the troops were going, or had any preliminary
                        planning, somebody saying, “Has somebody been doing a plan if we've got to
                        put troops in Bosnia?” The problem in Bosnia had been around for some
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The problem in Bosnia had been around for a long time, and there was a
                    lot of dispute and debate at political levels over what we might do in Bosnia.
                    The die was cast really when everybody met in Dayton and signed on the Dayton
                    Accords. That then obligated us to put together a plan. Essentially the plan we
                    had to put together was the plan dealing with our contribution to the
                    multinational force that was going to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have a whole bureaucratic organization planning to
                        stop the Soviet at the Fulda Gap. Had that at all been transferred to the
                        planning to what we were going to do in Bosnia? Had somebody been sort of
                        brainstorming this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The bureaucracy was sufficiently large and sufficiently versatile that it
                    could take on contingencies. Certainly within our planning operation we were
                    able to switch rather quickly to took a look at everything. We took a look a
                    cost effective ways of shipping 300,000 tons of war materiel. We had people on
                    the medical side geared up to go and the same on the logistics side. The legal
                    staff was ready to work on status of forces agreements. It took us very, very
                    little time to organize. That said, once we started organizing, we were briefing
                    new versions of the plans on an almost daily basis. The briefings were held at
                    the highest levels within our commands, so that two or three times a week we
                    would brief what we called the CINC, and virtually every day we would have a
                    briefing on the status of our thinking on various issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get a feel also for the cooperation. What about,
                        let's say, Budapest? We ended up with quite a large base in Hungary. How
                        about our embassy there, including the military attach�s and our embassies
                        other places? Had somebody drawn the line where they would go more or less?
                        Did they figure that they would come through here and through here and here
                        and how they would go? Were our embassies in the game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. What we found early on was that you could not ship the amount of
                    equipment that we wanted to ship on our delivery schedule using only one route;
                    so we had to use a number of different routes to get there. Some of our
                    calculations were purely physical. You could not ship certain items through
                    certain countries because the tunnels in those countries wouldn't permit that
                    size item to get througreal logistical problems. We also had an issue which was
                    rather curious. The Swiss were in the midst of a debate of redefining what
                    neutrality meant in the post Cold War era. The Swiss chief of defense came over
                    to visit us and pretty much begged us to plan and route a shipment through
                    Switzerland so that they would be able to demonstrate to their population that
                    in fact they could be neutral and yet be supportive of an international
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was basically a peace keeping operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was a peace keeping operatiopeace making essentially. I don't know
                    what it was in the context of the UN, but it met all the characteristics of a
                    Article 7 operation in that we were able to use force as...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did send some stuff through Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>WILSON: We did. That was particularly difficult to do, because moving stuff
                    through the Swiss mountains required resizing the packages so they would go
                    through the tunnels without major problemThat was important. Now, in the case of
                    Budapest we went there early on. We had a great ambassador there, Ambassador
                    Blinken, who had been working very, very closely with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Donald or David? They're twins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was the one who was not in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed the one who was in Brussels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was his older brother. I don't think they were twins; I think they
                    were just brothers, but maybe they were twins. In any case, the one in Budapest
                    was most helpful; he arranged for a series of meetings at very high levels of
                    the Hungarian government, during which the Hungarian government expressed its
                    full support of what we were doing and made the offer to host a support base in
                    southern Hungary. So that was not a problem, and, in fact, most countries were
                    helpful, with the exception of the Slovak Republic where the government was very
                    sensitive to what the domestic political fall out might be, and Italy. When we
                    went to Rome, we met with the Italian J4 and the J3 teams, which were the
                    logistics and the operations staffs. During the meeting with us, I was called
                    away from the meeting unexpectedly by the Italian chief of defense. He called me
                    up to his office and said that he was sorry that he hadn't been able to meet me
                    at the door when we came in. I had expected to meet with him; he had wanted to
                    have a chance to talk with me privately, and he took that occasion to air with
                    me every grievance the Italian military forces had had with the United States
                    since we were “allies together in the Second World War.” Far be it from me to
                    remind him that, in fact, we weren't allies in the Second World War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They declared war on us, by the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was dedicated to the principle that we were historic friends from time
                    immemorial. He asked me, of course, to relay all this to George Gawin, who was
                    CINCEUR. The Italians were particularly sensitive that anything we did on
                    Italian territory was to be done under the auspices of NATO and not as American
                    military forces. So even though we owned the forces and were training as U.S.
                    forces, we were training as a NATO or NATO Plus operation and had to basically
                    call it that. The other country where we had an interesting experience was the
                    former republic of Yugoslavia, Belgrade...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: ...which was essentially Serbigreater Serbiwe flew there. Again, we
                    thought we would meet with their planners, but their chief of defense, General
                    Peresech, showed up at the meeting. The General really was not interested in
                    what we had to say, even though the people around him were keenly interested.
                    This was a wonderful intelligence briefing for them. They were going to know
                    what the Americans were going to do and how the Americans were going to do it.
                    We were going to lay all that out for them. General Peresech didn't want that;
                    he wasn't interested. What he wanted was to sit across the table from me and
                    tell me how the Serbs had been friends of the Americans forever, fought in all
                    the wars together, and how the Serbs had been the aggrieved party and been put
                    upon by their enemies since the battle of...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1389, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: ...1389, whatever the battle was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kosovo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. He did that, chain smoking all the while. During his diatribe
                    against mI was really struck by the extent to which he tried to impose himself
                    on me and on everybody else at the meeting. I remember having a very conscious
                    thought that this guy had really misread me completely; he didn't know that I
                    had sat across from major leagued thugs like Saddam Hussein; if he really
                    thought that a minor league thug like him was going to impress me, he's had it
                    all wrong. After it was over, he got up and walked out. When he walked out, it
                    was a signal to everybody in the room that the meeting was over. So we got up
                    and walked out, and as a consequence the Serbs did not get the benefits of
                    either our J3 or J4 briefings. I got on the airplane and called George Gawin and
                    reported to him what Peresech had done. The CINCEUR arranged to fly four C17s to
                    Belgrade the next morning; he got off the airplane and strode right past General
                    Peresech to see Milosevic and set things straight. Whatever issues may have been
                    outstanding were no longer outstanding after George finished that meeting.</p>
                <p>The other discussions were also very interesting. Levels of embassy engagement
                    differed from embassy to embassy. Pam Harriman was probably the most
                    engaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was our ambassador...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>WILSON: She was our ambassador to France. Even though she was suffering from the
                    flu, she insisted not only on having a pre briefing, which I always gave to
                    every interested American ambassador, but she insisted also to be at the
                    briefing for the French, and as a consequence her presence, there was a much
                    more senior presence on the part of her staff; so she gave a level of importance
                    to it. She was, not just in this operation, the key to some other things we were
                    doing with the French, which I'll go into in a few minutes. So that was very,
                    very helpful in getting that high level attention. Other ambassadors were less
                    interested or less engaged, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Austria? So often there's a political
                        ambassador usually not at the top rung.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Our ambassador to Austria at the time was Suwanee Hunt; she was very
                    engaged and she had some good defense attach�s around her. She did not attend
                    the full briefing, as I recall, but she was interested. We did do a pre briefing
                    with her. She had her own interests in Yugoslavia. Her husband was a conductor
                    and he wanted to go to Belgrade to conduct the symphony orchestra there on New
                    Year's, which I think he ultimately did. So Ms. Hunt was keenly interested in
                    what she could do to help us. I think that since she left Austria, she
                    established a foundation to support women in Yugoslavia; so she's done really
                    quite well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Bratislava. I don't have a map in front of
                        me, but looking at train routes did Slovakia play a communications role in
                        this, or was this just being nice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I don't remember. We did send trains through Bratislava, because we had
                    to send them through the Czech Republic, and when they went through the Czech
                    Republic, they ended up going through the Slovak Republic as well. In fact, in
                    the category of “even the best laid plans often do go awry,” we had laid out for
                    them precisely how we were going to do this and we promised that we would give
                    them advance notice. We promised that we would take care of all issues. The
                    Slovaks wanted a liaison officer at Kaiserslautern to make sure that the
                    necessary paperwork was done well; we acceded to that. Everything was set for
                    the trains to go through, but the first train was something like 48 hours late.
                    On the Czech side they were terribly disappointed because they had tickertape
                    and balloons to greet the train coming through. On the Slovak side they were
                    disappointed and angry because they had tried to assure everybody that they had
                    this operation was well in hand; it was going to be well managed, but when the
                    very first train went through late, the opposition accused the government of
                    being bumbling idiots. We did send trains through Slovakia.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This means a lot of line of supply fruit sitting around to

                        rough and tumble people. I would think there would be problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, but there were surprisingly few problems. The discipline of
                    the American armed forces in this operation was exemplary, as it was everywhere
                    where we deployed. When we deployed, a review team went down to see our troops
                    in Gabon and Brazzaville, where they were deployed with French intelligence
                    troops and English troops. The discipline of our troops was far better by
                    comparison with others; it was good by any standards. There were very few
                    incidents. There were prohibitions on drinking, for example, in Tuzla itself.
                    Hungary was a staging area for R&amp;R, but even in Hungary there were very few
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned what I call Serbia, but Yugoslavia then. Did
                        the line go through there, or did it go through Croatia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Actually both. We had ships that went in through Croatia. We talked to
                    the Croats. We went to Zagreb. The Croatian main concerns were that we might do
                    environmental damage. They felt that we should assume liability for any
                    environmental damage that we might do in the movement of our equipment and
                    troops. I remember thinking at that time, that these were people who have been
                    involved in a civil war for the last 150 years; I bet one couldn't cut one
                    single tree down without finding bullets and shrapnel in every one in that
                    country. But that was their concern. We did, for the purposes of making the
                    point, move stuff through Belgrade. I think the C17 by air was principal way
                    that we did that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It started really in the fall of 1995.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: This was pretty much my first task. I can't remember when we ended it,
                    but we had everybody there and then were reducing the resupply operations...</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>WILSON: As I said, I was basically reporting to the DCINC. He was responsible for
                    the day to day supervision of all operations. We would come up with a plan, get
                    his approval and then we would execute it. In this particular assignmenI was
                    pretty operational, because I led the team going to all these countries. We had
                    an airplane, we had briefers, we had a Power Point show, and then we had me to
                    go and...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had a slide show which visualized everything that we were planning on
                    doing. That was basically my operation. I would coordinate with the embassies
                    and the attach�s, set up the times and places where we would go, and then we
                    would go and do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I go back to my experience when I was in Saigon as consul
                        general. The military briefings are so different than State Department
                        briefings when usually a State Department officer would get up and discuss
                        the situation a little more professorial. The military would get up and it
                        would be full of very precise things. Sometimes they were dead wrong, but
                        whatever it was it was very impressive because there was no hedging
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were very certain of themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very certain of themselves even if they were on the sticky
                        wicket. How did you find that you fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I found the melding of the two cultures to be very easy. I found that,
                    depending on whom we were briefing, my role would be lesser or greater. Just to
                    give you an example: if we were briefing only military officers, the military
                    would go through their briefings; I might interject or I might answer questions
                    from the participants. In briefings for civilian authorities, who think much
                    more like Foreign Service officers than they do like military officers, there
                    would be need for greater involvement on my part to round out what the military
                    was trying to say; I would add a little bit to what we saying in terms that
                    civilians might more easily understand, making sure that there was enough
                    sensitivity to sovereign interests as we were going forward. For example, when
                    the military briefed the Slovaks that we were going to bring 20,000 troops and
                    300,000 tons of arms through their country, I would sort of jump in and say,
                    'consistent with international agreements and consistent with your own sovereign
                    concerns.” so that their sovereign concerns were not offended..</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Q: This is always one of the great differences between the military and the
                    diplomatic side. We are trying to be sensitive. You don't do something without
                    being sensitive of the culture in which you're dealing, the foreign culture and
                    often sovereignty, whereas the military: 'We have a task to do, it's a good
                    cause, and of course these people will fall in.' Was there a new breed of
                    officer more aware of this, or were you acting as sort of a Foreign Service
                    Institute professor from time to time with the military to get them to
                    understand what some of the sovereignty issues were?</p>
                <p>WILSON: I didn't act so much as a Foreign Service Institute professor; I did
                    periodically remind them that as an ambassador I carried the personal rank of a
                    threor four star general. They understand that much better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had that sense of a rank with them for NATO
                        command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Within the CINCEUR command. Everybody understood that in the manner the
                    command protocol structure was set up, I was the “number three,” even though I
                    did not have any line responsibilities. The top management staff consisted of
                    the DCINC who was a four star, his boss who was also a four star, the chief of
                    staff who was the senior operating officer who was a three star, and myself.
                    There was one two star who tried to challenge that at one point; he is now
                    retired. That didn't work. The mistake he made was that he didn't understand
                    that my office was right next to the DCINC's office and that the DCINC and I
                    were inveterate cigar smokers and golfers, so we spent 70 percent of our time
                    together. We were either on airplanes traveling somewhere or we were at meetings
                    together or we were on a golf course together smoking cigars every weekend. The
                    two star made the mistake of not understanding that relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the thing go, and what was your impression of how
                        this deployment worked, and what were some of the issues that came to your
                        attention? Did you get involved in the Bosnian issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>WILSON: I was amazed at how smoothly it went. I was amazed by the willingness of
                    everybody from these various commands to cooperate and coordinate and to iron
                    out any differences, because, when you do start an operation like this, you have
                    not just the joint command planning but you also have the respective services
                    thinking through how they're going to do it. The Air Force has its
                    responsibilities, which was transport goods and personnel as well as providing
                    private aircraft. The Army has its responsibilities, which are to provide
                    infantry, artillery, tankers, etc.; and the Navy has its responsibilities. It is
                    up to the joint planners to harmonize all these relationships and make sure that
                    you truly do have a joint operation going on at the same time. That required a
                    lot of work, and these guys worked day and night. I was also struck, I must say,
                    by the sophistication of the management of a complex organization, despite the
                    fact that the hierarchy is pretty rigid. When a four star says you're going to
                    do something, you salute and you do it. When issues needed to be resolvewhen
                    there was a conflict between services or various divisions within a command on
                    implementatiothey were resolved quickly, with an emphasis on pragmatism and on
                    getting the job done. When there were issues with foreign governments, the
                    military was quick to respond. The military was good at insuring that it
                    maintained good relations with ambassadors and that it was responsive when
                    issues arose. When guys got sick, when a guy fell of a train, when people got
                    injured, when people got hospitalized, all these problems were resolved really
                    very quickly and I think to the satisfaction of most. When I was there, there
                    were virtually no issues that came to my attention that remained festering
                    sores. I came away very impressed with the military organizatiothe way they
                    treat their people, the way they're task oriented, the work ethic within the
                    military. That is not just the officer corps, because we spent a lot of time
                    with the troops in the various operations that they were runninand with their
                    ability to achieve what they set out to do.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Right.</p>

                    well?</p>
                <p>WILSON: The air war had been principally if not exclusively run by the Navy. It
                    was run off the Adriatic by Admiral Snuffy Smith, who was a very interesting
                    character and whose clashes with George Gawin were the stuff of legenmost of
                    which took place before I got there but I saw the two of them in the ring
                    together a couple of times and it was something to behold. The clash of four
                    star egos was something to behold.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Oh, yes; it was sort of a manly strutting abouwho's got the biggest chest
                    type of thinbut it was very amusing. The one sterling quality of Jim Jamerson,
                    the Air Force four star, was that he was not encumbered by an oversize ego and
                    he was able to accomplish everything he set out to do with a quiet confidence in
                    a rather self effacing manner. That's not to say that he just laid down and
                    rolled over for guys, but he didn't need to strut his stuff the same way that
                    Snuffy and George did.</p>
                <p>I think that the bombing campaign had been pretty much wrapped up by the time I
                    got there. It was not an operation I had much to do with or knew much about,
                    except that Snuffy would come to brief the DCINC periodically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously this Bosnian thing absorbed you for awhile, but
                        NATO must have been looking beyond thilooking around for 'what the hell are
                        we here for?'</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: NATO was different. George Gawin had his own NATO political advisor;
                    there was a POLAD SACEUR.</p>
                <p>We did most of the stuff that was not done in the NATO context. That is why
                    “Operation Provide Comfort” and all the African operations came under our
                    umbrella and which is why when George went down to Israel I accompanied him
                    instead of SACEUR political advisor because Israel is not a NATO country.</p>
                <p>It is important to understand that, at the same time that we were conducting
                    operations in Bosnia, we were also very concerned with “Operation Provide
                    Comfort” and how that was progressing. We had a series of running battles with
                    the Turks over the management of that operation. The French withdrew from the
                    operation early in my tenure. The Turkish parliament had to reapprove the
                    operation every three or six months; that was a constant source of friction as
                    it was a constant source of political debate within Turkey. The Turks nickeled
                    and dimed us to death in the day to day operations of “Operation Provide
                    Comfort. “ We spent a lot of time on that. Mark Grossman was the ambassador to
                    Turkey; he had been the deputy there when I had been in Baghdad, and Mark and I
                    also went to the same university. Even though we didn't know each other there,
                    we had sort of a similar background. So we dealt very, very closely with him. We
                    had constant battles with the Turks. We used to have to get the deputy chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Ralston, to go to Ankara on a periodic basis to
                    break the deadlocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the Turks just wanting to extract from us or was it
                        the Kurdish thing that seemed to concern...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>WILSON: Some of all of the above. The Turks were concerned about how much money
                    they had lost in cross border trade as result of the sanctions. They were
                    concerned that by operating “Operation Provide Comfort” we were strengthening
                    the Kurdish hand and that a strong Kurdish element in Iraq would bring brought
                    forth the specter of an autonomous or independent Kurdistan which might
                    encourage Turkish Kurds to continue to strive to achieve the same thing at a
                    time when the PKK was still...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Marxist...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Marxist Leninist Kurdish terrorist group that has been on our list of
                    terrorist organizations for 15 years. The Turkish concern was that the Kurds
                    would gain some sort of inherent legitimacy through our operations and/or that
                    this sort of decade long move for an independent Kurdistan carved out of
                    Iranian, Turkish, Iraqi and Syrian territory would come to fruition. So they
                    were concerned about all of that. They were also concerned, I think, more
                    generally about the notion that we would be dropping bombs on Iraqi civilians
                    from airplanes that would be taking off from Turkish territory and that one day
                    we would leave and go home and Turkey would still be there with Iraq.</p>
                <p>One of the most telling comments that was made to me, which I repeat to my
                    Turkish friends on a regular basis, came while we were in Turkey for one of our
                    negotiation sessions. After the session we had dinner with the Turkish General
                    Staff; the then deputy chief of the Turkish General Staff was a fellow by the
                    name of General Sevik Beer, who had worked with April Glaspie at one stage. He
                    had run a UN operation in Somalia when April Glaspie had been in Somalia. Beer
                    stood up and in the course of his toast he said, “You might find us difficult on
                    issues related to “Operation Provide Comfort,” but the one thing you really need
                    to understand is that in Turkey we have nine neighbors, we have nine countries
                    with whom we share borders and that in our neighborhood our very best
                    relationships are with Iraq.” That was said to us so that we would have some
                    understanding of the complexities of the issues as they saw it from their
                    perspective. My reaction was' “Boy, they really have a problem in their foreign
                    ministry if they've got nine neighbors and they can't get along with any of them
                    and their best relationship is with Iraq.” That told me that they needed to work
                    on their diplomacy a little bit. It was in that context that we would have to
                    deal with them on “Operation Provide Comfort.” This was also at a time when the
                    Muslim Fundamentalist Party was gaining some strength and stature and was
                    threatening to form a traditional party block. I can't remember whether it was
                    the Motherland Party or the Reform Party; I can't remember what it was called.
                    The Turkish General Staff was real concerned about this situation and didn't
                    want to give them any fuel for the fire. It was a highly nationalistic party and
                    one that threatened the status quo; ultimately the Turkish General Staff saw it
                    as a threat to their responsibilities under the Turkish Constitution to
                    safeguard both the Constitution and the secular nature of the government of the
                    regime. So at the same time we're working on Bosnia, we're implementing
                    “Operation Provide Comfort,” and also at the same time we're beginning to focus
                    on Africa.</p>

                        dealings with the Kurdish rulers in Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not so much with the leaders. We went to Zakhu on our very first trip.
                    Jim and I flew to Interlake, which is where our base was, and then to Diyarbakir
                    which is in southeastern Turkey. After meeting the civilian and military
                    authorities in Diyarbakir, we then helicoptered down to Zakhu, which is just
                    across the Turkey Iraq border where we met with our people. We had some military
                    people there; we had a headquarters there, and that's where our operation to
                    support the Kurds was based. The Kurdish leaders at that time were all in Irbil;
                    so we met principally with the Americans who were there as well as with a guard
                    force which the Kurds that we had hired to insure our own force protection while
                    we were in Zakhu. We were there at an interesting time because there were some
                    threats on our people and there had been a building that had been blown
                    up...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the Iraqis or the PKK?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Iraqis. At that time the KDP, which is one of the Kurdish factions, and
                    the PKK were pretty much in alliance. The PKK had not posed a threat to our
                    operations in Iraq. In fact, the PKK, to my recollection, hadn't targeted any
                    American assets; they had targeted principally Turkish assets throughout their
                    long terrorist campaign, which had killed a lot of innocent civilians. It was a
                    great homecoming because the Kurds knew that Jim Jamerson was the guy who had
                    set up “Operation Provide Comfort” in the first place. As soon as got off the
                    helicopters, word went out that he was back. That was coupled with the fact that
                    people recognized that I was the last American to have met with Saddam Hussein.
                    I thought it would be in our interest for Saddam Hussein to understand that his
                    nemesis was back in northern Iraq. We put the word out and assumed that Saddam
                    Hussein knew it before we left, given the extent of his information gathering
                    operations. That was an interesting trip and an awful lot of fun for us. We
                    found that we had tremendous support. Our troops who were operating there, even
                    though under some threat, seemed to have a lot of confidence in the Peshmergas
                    around them; they certainly took good care of us when we were there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: As I said, the third piece of my work dealt with Africa. All the efforts
                    I described were happening pretty much simultaneously, so that when I wasn't
                    traveling to the Bratislavas of the world or to Turkey, we were traveling to
                    Africa or to the Baltics, where as a consequence of the end of the Cold War, we
                    had put together a number of engagement programs with the former Soviet Union
                    states.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were U.S., not NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>WILSON: These were U.S. efforts. We used the National Guard and the Reservists to
                    help us. We had National Guardsmen based in these countries conducting training
                    and exercise programs. That took us to the Baltics when we weren't in Africa. In
                    Africa, we were doing things like moving the Marine expeditionary unit into
                    position in the Mediterranean to evacuate our people in Sudan if we needed. We
                    drew down our embassy staff in Sudan because we had received a threat to our
                    personnel. We were in Rwanda; we were in Sierra Leone; we moved our troops to
                    Liberia; we conducted some planning operations later for eastern Zaire. In the
                    course of our first trip that Jim Jamerson and I made to Africa, we took The
                    Department's deputy assistant secretary with us and went a number of different
                    places. This was at the beginning of 1996 and we were the third of three envoys
                    going to Angola on behalf of the U.S. governmenthe first having been Madeleine
                    Albright in her capacity as UN ambassador, the second being AID Director Brian
                    Atwood, and the third was us. Our purpose was to support and advance the peace
                    process which was designed to bring about the end of the Angolan War. That was
                    Jim Jamerson's first trip there. We came back through Cote d'Ivoire and went to
                    see President Houphouet Boigny to talk to him about guns being smuggled from
                    Burkina Faso through C�te d'Ivoire to the Liberia. This was a piece of pretty
                    serious diplomacy we were trying to advance, and our message to Boigny was, “You
                    need to remember that given the ethnic divisions that you have in your own
                    country, which are very similar to those in Liberia, you should not be sanguine
                    about what you're doing with respect to Liberia. The guns you send over there
                    today may well come back to C�te d'Ivoire tomorrow.” They had done in some
                    respects. Jim Jamerson, who had the mandate from George Gawin, realized that
                    there was a lot of interests there. When we came back, we thought long and hard
                    about some things we might do. We came up with a number of ideas. For example,
                    we had historically trained African troops on a bilateral basis. We would
                    undertake a joint exercise with the Malian troops. We came to believe that if we
                    put the Malians and, the Nigerians and the Burkina Faso and the Burkinave
                    together, we might have a multiplier effect that was twofold. One, we would be
                    able to train with three different military organizations at the same time; and,
                    two, these military organizations would be able to train together and get to
                    know each other. George Gawin was very supportive of this idea because he had
                    taken the same approach when he had been in charge of Southern Commanthe Latin
                    American command. One of the things he used to always say was that when he had
                    gone to visit there, he had realized that the military leaders from the various
                    countries hardly knew each other. If you don't know each other, the potential
                    for misunderstanding is far greater. So had a lot of support in putting together
                    operations, which we ended up calling the “Flintlock” series of exercises, where
                    we would bring people from different countries together for an exercise program.
                    This was consistent with the philosophy behind the creation of the Marshall
                    Center, which was a post Cold War idea to education bureaucrats and defense
                    officials from different countries both within NATO and from the former Warsaw
                    Pact together on how to program defense and national security affairs in a
                    democracy. Implicit in this objective was to allow people of different
                    backgrounds and countriesome of which might have been enemies in the pasto get
                    to know each other in a different way than they might have known each other
                    otherwise. We applied some of same reasoning to Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>At the same time, and not altogether for altruistic reasons, I must say, I
                    broached the subject of beginning to work with some of the European countries on
                    how we might work together in the future on issues. The theory behind that was
                    that we would be going to war in the future much like we had gone to war in Iraq
                    or much like we were going to go to war in Bosnii.e., with a coalition of
                    friends and allies. Therefore, why don't we start working with friends and
                    allies now in anticipation of future operations together so that, when the
                    operations actually happen, we will have developed the relationships necessary
                    to do things smoothly. Part of this came out of a discussion we had with a
                    master sergeant down in Mali, where there our Special Forces had gone for a
                    three week training mission. We were talking to him and I asked him how he was
                    doing. He said, “This is great. We live for this sort of stuff. This is
                    terrific, to just fire off guns out in the desert. And by the wathis is our
                    third time here in Mallast year when we were deployed in Haiti for a policing
                    operation, one day we were walking around and went around a corner and met this
                    fellow in a military uniform. I looked at him and he looked at me, and we
                    realized we had known each other because we had trained together here in Mali
                    the previous year.” He said to us, “As a consequence of the training we had done
                    together here in Mali, we were able to coordinate and meld our operations
                    immediately in Haiti. We were up and running. There was no sniffing armpit time
                    necessary. We knew what we were going to do and how we were going to do it.”</p>
                <p>I should say that, selfishly, all my career I had wanted to serve in Paris. That
                    is all I ever wanted to do, and it was pretty clear to me that I was never going
                    to get that chance. Stuttgart was probably as close as I would ever get. I
                    thought to myself, “Well, maybe one way of getting to Paris more often is by
                    promoting this idea and suggesting that we use the French as the first target
                    country. I argued that for one, it was pretty clear that we were going to have
                    to deploy in Africa more often than we wanted. We had the strategic lift, the
                    French had historical connections and bases in Africa, we had a congruity of
                    interestwe wanted to save our nationals; we didn't want the security situation
                    to fall into chaos in any of these countries. Why shouldn't we try to work with
                    the French on African issues, develop a relationship that will allow us to
                    deploy in Africa in a more efficient and expeditious manner. Jim Jamerson bought
                    off on it, and as a consequence I got to go to Paris about every three or four
                    weeks. Being a diplomat I didn't feel compelled to fly in in the morning and fly
                    back in the afternoon. I could take two or three days and at my leisure deal
                    with the French generals and the admirals. I never had to deal with the feckless
                    French diplomats at the Foreign Ministry. I was always dealing with the Ministry
                    of Defense or the French armed forces.</p>

                <p>WILSON: When it comes to AfricI think maybe even generallthe French military
                    culture matches up much more closely to the American military culture than does
                    to the French Foreign Ministry culture to our diplomats. I think I could
                    probably say that American generals get along better with French generals than
                    they do with American ambassadors, just because there's a certain professional
                    fraternity there. It is also true that when you're dealing with the French
                    military, much like with the American military, you have to understand that
                    they're task oriented and pragmatic. When you're dealing with the French
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the American State Department, there are various
                    interests that are fostered by intrigue and petty jealousies and rivalries,
                    etc., and something called national interest. It was much easier to deal with
                    the French military. I spoke good French, and the French military came to trust
                    me; the American military in Paris came to trust me as interlocutor, I could go
                    and conduct a lot of business at the most senior levels of the French defense
                    establishment including the chief of Defense, including General Duran, who was
                    the Air Force commanding general at the time. We did this. We had intelligence
                    exchanges; we moved the liaison officer to our joint command headquarters; we
                    established a much closer liaison relationship with their intelligence unit in
                    Paris, and we actually began to put some exercises together. We would invite
                    them as observers to exercises that we were conducting in Africa. They would
                    invite us to exercises they were conducting in Africa. Then we began to do
                    exercises together, which turned out to be both timely and very effective. When
                    we went into the Central African Republic to settle a blow up there, we did it
                    with the French. It was not without its friction, but the fact that we had this
                    relationship allowed us to deal with the issues at a technical level before the
                    friction got out of hand. Equally, when we went into Sierra Leone there were
                    some problems. The French had some ships offshore, and there were some problems
                    over how we were going to manage it. Again, we were able to solve the
                    problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing in Sierra Leone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were evacuating foreigners at a time of a coup d'�tat. A major problem
                    arose when Paul Kagame decided to get involved. Paul Kagame was the vice
                    president and minister of defense of the Republic of Rwanda. He was the man who
                    had led the military force that had overthrown the Hutu dominated government of
                    Rwanda after the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the group that came from Rwanda?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>WILSON: They came from Uganda. They were essentially Rwandan refugees who had
                    been thrown out of Rwanda in the 1970s, had grown up in the refugee camps in
                    Uganda, had organized themselves into a military force, and then had entered
                    Rwanda and overthrown the Hutu dominated governmenafter the Hutu dominated
                    government and its most extreme backers had engaged in this genocide against the
                    Tutsis. As a consequence of the Rwandan civil war that had spilled over into
                    eastern Zaire, some refugee campthe Rwandans allegewere being used by the
                    ZaireanMobutu in particulaand by defeated rebels as a staging area and training
                    ground for a force that was being built to try to overthrow the Rwandan
                    government. Their argument was that the United Nations, which was the protector
                    of these refugee camps, had an obligation to move them further back. But the
                    United Nations was incapable of accomplishing that particular task. I went to
                    see Kagame with Jim Jamerson. He basically said to us, “If you don't do it,
                    we'll do it ourselves; we're going to have to do it ourselves.” Nothing happened
                    and the Rwandans invaded Zaire and attacked the camps, and after they did that
                    they just went ahead and marched on to Kinshasa and looked for Mobutu. But in
                    moving the refugee camps, they sparked a return to Rwanda of several hundred
                    thousand refugees and also forced 50,000 100,000 other refugees to flee into the
                    forest. The international community decided it had to do something to protect
                    these several hundred thousand refugees. The United Nations was debating the
                    kind of authority relationship that it was going to develop to allow an
                    operation to proceed. At the same time that it was doing that, we convoked, with
                    the French and with Belgium and with a number of other countries who had
                    interest including African countries, a planning conference in Stuttgart to map
                    out an operation, which was going to be headed by a Canadian general. We would
                    never have been able to convene such a group in Stuttgart before, had we not
                    actively pursued a whole new set of relationships with these other countries and
                    their military; so this was a real first.</p>
                <p>At the same time this was all happening, we and the French, who for their own
                    political reasons had a different interpretation of what was going on from us,
                    were at loggerheads over how many people had fled into the jungle, what was the
                    extent to which there were crimes being perpetrated against these people, etc.
                    Because we had developed the multilateral relationships which included sharing
                    intelligence, we were able to convene at the technical level the intelligence
                    analysts every two or three days to narrow the differences. When you deal in
                    subjects like this, you deal not just in information but you deal in methodology
                    to interpret the information and analyze the information. The discussions became
                    so detailed that we were actually sharing methodologies used to count people,
                    for example. So even though we never did agree completely on the numbers, again,
                    because we had developed these relationships, we were able to contain the
                    parameters of the dispute, and that was really important as we moved forward. We
                    ended up not deploying because most of the refugees returned to Rwanda on their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems that it actually worked relatively well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>WILSON: The return to Rwanda worked very well. The deployment itself was never
                    going to go forward as long as there were so many groups in Zaire shooting in so
                    many different directions. We had to have a policy which was consistent with our
                    own Presidential Decision Directive 25 which said that the parties involved had
                    to be responsible for insuring that there would be a cease fire, so that you
                    wouldn't put peace keepers in unnecessary dangea Chapter 6 type peace keeping
                    operation. In the case of eastern Zaire, there were so many different groups
                    shooting at each other that you would never going to get anything authoritative
                    on cease fires. In the end, if you ask the French, you will get a much different
                    interpretation of how well it went because the French counted more the people
                    who might have been lost in the jungle than they counted the people who might
                    have been repatriated back into Rwanda. The bottom line is that we then were
                    able to develop a track record. We ran a multinational planning conference at
                    our headquarters designed to plan for a peace keeping operation in eastern
                    Zaire.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me ask a question because I recall that here in Washington, really at the
                    Foreign Service Institute, they had several conferences on this problem. One of
                    the things that was brought out was that the people who often end up taking care
                    of many problems after the military action has taken place, are the non
                    governmental organizationthe NGOs. However they are often left out of the
                    planning until after the military has taken action. It makes sense therefore to
                    include the NGOs in the planning because they become the professional
                    organizations which become responsible for feeding, shelter, medicine and all
                    this. Could you talk a little about those.</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's a legitimate point of view. We used to call it the melding of the
                    “shorhairs and the earring” set. It was something to which we in our command
                    were very sensitive after 1994 when we went in to Rwanda, spent $500 million in
                    a few weeks, and had very little to show for it other than burying a lot of
                    dead, purifying a lot of water to keep the living from dyinthat in and of itself
                    was a good operation once it happened, but we spent the equivalent of two thirds
                    of our annual development assistance budget for Africa for that purpose. As a
                    consequence, George Gawin and Madam Ogata, who was the UN Commissioner for
                    Refugees at the time, began to work much more closely together to insure that we
                    had a coordinating mechanism which included the NGO community for those things
                    for which it would be responsible normally. That was something that was in the
                    interest of the military to do, and it was something that was in the interest of
                    the NGO community to do. The military didn't want to take on any more
                    nonmilitary tasks than it absolutely had to do. It wasn't trained for it, it
                    didn't have the resource for it, it detracted from its core responsibilities; so
                    it just didn't like to do it. It couldn't do it very well. The NGO community, on
                    the other hand, as good as it was at feeding people and providing some necessary
                    services once it got the trouble spot, had great difficulty in mobilizing and
                    getting there in an efficient fashion. As Gawin put it to Madam Ogata in one
                    meeting that I attended, “The difference between you and me is that when I give
                    an order, my guys salute and go to get the job done; when you give an order,
                    your people take it as an invitation to debate,” which I think is a pretty
                    accurate description of the difference between the ways the military and
                    civilians do things. What we tried to do after 1994, for every operation that we
                    conducted in Africa during the time that I was in Stuttgart, was to establish an
                    office in Geneva. We would send somebody from our command to Geneva, who would
                    be responsible for insuring that the relevant people under Madam Ogata's
                    umbrella in the NGO community would be privy to all the briefings we were giving
                    and would be invited to contribute their ideas on how we could do it better. We
                    did everything we could to have a higher level of cooperation. One of the things
                    that we found was that the NGO community, by and large, was more suspicious of
                    the military than the military was of the NGO community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is part of the culture in the United States after
                        Vietnam, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. That's why we called it 'the short hairs versus the earring
                    set'. The military didn't like guys with earrings; the guys with earrings didn't
                    like guys with short hair basically. We had to figure out how to make the
                    cooperation happen, and we worked very hard at it. I'm not sure that we will
                    ever completely succeed, but I think we've gotten a lot better. We've gotten a
                    lot better in the former Yugoslavia, we've gotten a lot better in the Africa.
                    There are two types of NGO communities. There's the “advocacy” crowd, the Human
                    Rights Watch and what not, who are always looking at what might be done
                    differently given their conception of what is the perfect way of doing things;
                    and then you have the development NGOs who actually get involved and provide the
                    sort of support and assistance that is needed and don't have an obvious overlay
                    of political agenda. So that worked pretty well. Jim and I were down in Africa
                    about every six weeks. We would cycle back through Angola every couple months to
                    talk to the Angolans to try and keep that peace process moving forward. We put
                    together a military action program which came to be known as the “African Crisis
                    Response Initiative.” We were already working on the military program when the
                    diplomats in Washington came out with the diplomatic overlay. The “African
                    Crisis Response Initiative” came about as a consequence of international
                    concerns that Burundi was on the verge of a genocide similar to Rwanda which
                    raised the question on how the international community could respond more
                    quickly than it had in the Rwandan crisis. The conclusion was that there should
                    be an African military force prepared to move quickly to create zones of safety
                    between the various belligerents and to protect innocent civilians. We devised a
                    number of training programs that would enhance African capabilities to serve
                    these purposealthough we came to find out that African forces had a lot of
                    experience in peace keeping operations. The second thing that we tried to
                    enhance was their ability to operate together; we worked very hard on
                    interoperability and command and control of battalions from different countries.
                    While they were thinking this problem through, we were independently coming up
                    with our Flintlock Series and were already beginning to work on command and
                    control type exercise with militaries from different countries. The two programs
                    actually melded together very nicely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We saw as our role, as I take it, operational, mainly
                        transport and supplies and getting the troops there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>WILSON: We saw our role as providing unique capabilities. Secretary of Defense
                    Bill Perry said that when he came to see us. We briefed him on our concept for
                    Africa. He bought what we were doing, which gave us a lot of impetus for
                    continuing. But what he said was, “Look, Africa is clearly an issue for this
                    theater. We need to be responsive without having to put our boots on the ground.
                    Any country can put boots on the ground. What we ought to do is what other
                    countries cannot do. That ought to be our contribution.” We defined that
                    contribution as training above the battalion levemost of these African countries
                    don't have militaries above the brigade level, so we wanted to be able to train
                    command and control operations above thamulti brigade or multi battalion type
                    command and controas well as providing intelligence, communications and
                    transport. Those were the things that we thought that we could do that other
                    countries probably couldn't do quite as well; those were the things we began to
                    focus on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at Liberia and Sierra Leone, where there were some

                        slaughter went on for a long time. Correct me if I'm wrong on this. Was this
                        of concern to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That was true for Liberia in particular, which was the situation that was
                    most acute when I was in Stuttgart. The economic community of West African
                    States had already mobilized, using a preponderance of Nigerian troops, and had
                    deployed into Liberia under the auspices of relevant UN resolutions. They were
                    trying to do some peace keeping in the run up to the elections that ultimately
                    brought Charles Taylor to power. They were hampered by poor leadership for a
                    while and by a lack of discipline. Eventually, they changed their generals and
                    then they got a lot better. We were operating principally out of Washington to
                    try to support the operation by bringing together a group of donor nations who
                    would provide supplies and support to match the Nigerian contribution. To a
                    certain extent we were hamstrung in our relationship with Nigeria because the
                    Abacha regime was anathema to our administration, for good reasons. It was a
                    dictatorship, it was a kleptocracy that was engaged in a repression of its
                    people; it was just not a very good crowd. But we attempted to figure out ways
                    to work with them on this issue of common concerthe resolution for the Liberian
                    civil wawhich had been going on and off for the past 20 year10 or 15 years
                    anyway. We had worked very hard. We had a guy by the name of Howard Jeter, as
                    our ambassador in Nigerihad been our ambassador in Botswana. He was running
                    around trying to get everybody to contribute money and materiel and what not; we
                    were working with him on how we could transport the materiel and what we as a
                    command could do to be supportive of his efforts. He would come to Stuttgart
                    frequently. We would meet with him. Jim and I had met him first when he was
                    ambassador to Botswana, so there was a good personal relationship. I had known
                    him for a number of years obviously. We had been in Botswana when he was
                    ambassador there; Jim was able to develop a good personal relationship which
                    allowed us to work more closely with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>I should mention one thing about these whole Africa related issues. When I first
                    got to the command, I met a lieutenant colonel who was in the Africa Division of
                    J5, which is the Policy and Planning staff. I met him at an airport because we
                    were meeting somebody coming ian American ambassador going to Africa. This
                    happened literally the first week I was there. The lieutenant colonel was
                    telling me about what a great Special Forces officer he was, how he had made
                    high altitude, low opening jumps; he had been a Special Forces guy all his life,
                    and then he complained that he was now stuck in this backwater operation
                    worrying Africa, sort of lost and forgotten, his career not going anywhere, in
                    an area he didn't understand or know and didn't care anything about. Within six
                    months these guythere were three of them in this officwere the stars of the
                    command. They were the ones who were traveling with the DCINC every time he went
                    down to Africa. They were the ones who had seats on the airplane, they were the
                    ones who had face time with a four star, they were the ones who were known by
                    name by the four star. They were the stars of the command. It was Jim Jamerson's
                    dedication to seeing that the command really reflect the threats that were
                    arrayed against us and that it be able to respond to them that allowed the
                    bureaucracy that was the European Command to shift from defending the Fulda Gap
                    to thinking about the threats that it currently faced. It helped us become more
                    flexible as we looked not just at African threats, but also at European
                    activities and activities like “Operation Provide Comfort.” It gave a much
                    different dimension to the way that the command thought about doing its
                    business. Jim and I often still talk aboubecause we still play golf togetheis
                    the defining moment for the post Cold War command. It was there and then that we
                    actually restructured the command. At one point he and I came back to
                    Washingtoit was just right after Tom Pickering had been named undersecretary for
                    political affairto lay our vision. Our vision was that in the post Cold War
                    world you were going to have conflicts that are, by their nature, as bloody as
                    any other war was for a specific geographic location, but would in the grand
                    scheme of things be smaller, and that there was an inverse relationship between
                    the level of diplomacy and political thinking required and the level of military
                    thinking, depending on the size of the war. The smaller the war, the more
                    diplomacy and politics would have to be involved. The bigger the war, the more
                    the politicians would have to stand aside and let the generals took care of
                    business, which meant, as we extrapolated, that in the environment of the next
                    20 to 30 years, we would witness small, intense conflicts with a political and
                    diplomatic dimension, which made it essential to have political advisors with
                    the military commands who were of sufficient stature and seniority that they
                    could actually have an impact on the way the command was thinking. From the
                    State Department perspective, we being a small and shrinking agency in the
                    foreign affairs arena; this would be a great opportunity to leverage a much
                    larger agency in the foreign affairs arena to do our bidding and to really be an
                    asset, one of our assets, as we went forward. Since then there have been a
                    number of articles in the Washington Post about the phenomenon of the CINCdoms
                    created by Goldwater Nicholthe CINCdoms being the commands that have been set up
                    giving “pro consul” responsibilities to these generals with all their power and
                    their assets of the enormous American military strength. We actually got Tom to
                    buy into this, and as a consequence they now name political advisors the same
                    way they name ambassadors. It goes through the deputy secretary's Committee, to
                    insure that people assigned as political advisors are senior enough to have a
                    lot of stature and a lot of authority and yet young enough to still have a lot
                    of energy as well and still have some lift in their careers.</p>

                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. Larry was in charge of Gulf affairs in the Department when
                    I was in Baghdad; he and I are very good friends. It did come a cropper there
                    and he did not get a hearing. It was very clear. The story is, and it's written
                    up and available in the public domain, that the Helms staffer told him. “You
                    will not get a clearing, you will not get cleared until such time as you
                    repudiate Zinni.”</p>

                <p>WILSON: It's disgusting but, you know, part of an ambassadorial job description
                    is that you're going to get hung out to dry. Eagleburger used to say, “Hey, if
                    you can't take the heat of getting fired, then you've got no business being an
                    ambassador.”</p>

                        situation, the “Operation Provide Comfort?” My understanding is that France
                        was one of the main instigators in getting us in there, maybe because Madam
                        Mitterrand, who was the wife of the president of France, was very much
                        interested in the Kurdish issue; so she sort of led a campaign on TV and
                        everything else to get us in there. Why did the French pull out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I don't know why they pulled out. It is true that Danielle Mitterrand was
                    a Kurdish hugger. One of her closest friends was a good friend of ours, a guy by
                    the name of Katzemlu, who was the head of the Iranian Kurdish party; his wife
                    was French and he spoke perfect French. He had been educated in Czechoslovakia.
                    He was later assassinated by the Iranians in Vienna. By the time the French
                    pulled out, there was a difference of opinion on how we ought to be prosecuting
                    a containment strategy against the Iraqis. The French, being French, were
                    looking for ways not to lose their primacy in that part of the world and in
                    Iraq. As you may recall, the French had been principal arms sellers to Saddam
                    Hussein during the Iran Iraq War including the Exocet missile that landed in the
                    USS Stark and killed 34 American sailors.</p>

                <p>WILSON: It's one of our destroyers in the Gulf. So I think that they were
                    probably hedging their bets to a large extent. It also came about the time when
                    the French were professionalizing their armed services, which meant that they
                    were getting rid of their draft They were downsizing, and it was a burden on
                    them to continue to maintain this presence in Iraq, although I suspect that it
                    was as much for political reasons as it was for military ones that caused them
                    to withdraw from the operation. In fact, I know it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling that you were getting at your
                        headquarters? You had to interface with the UN from time to time,
                        particularly in Africa. What was the feeling, that this was a difficult
                        organization, ineffective, or one to be cultivated? How did you feel about
                        the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>WILSON: We interfaced with the United Nations on two levels. One, we used to go
                    see Madam Ogata periodically. We would set up liaison offices every time we had
                    an operation, so that we had a connection with her and the NGO community. Then,
                    two, our other principal interface with the UN was in Angola, where the UN
                    secretary general had a special representative, who was the former Malian
                    foreign minister, Blondin Bay, who was later killed in an airplane accident in
                    Cote d'Ivoire, I guess. Part of the Lusaka process had involved a UN operation
                    to disarm and demobilize UNITA soldiers. We liked Blondin Bay a lot. We liked
                    him personally; we liked what he was trying to do. We liked the Lusaka process.
                    We thought that that was the best way forward. So at all levels we were very
                    supportive. We relished the opportunity to go to see him, and Jim and I went
                    there a lot. I was in the White House for our last trip and I made sure that Jim
                    came with us when we took the president to Africa and then he and I went up to
                    Angola for one last time. So this time it was the president's special assistant
                    accompanied by a senior military officer. Before it had always been the DCINC
                    accompanied by his political advisor. But we always welcomed the opportunity to
                    engage Blondin Bay and to be supportive of what the UN was doing there. We tried
                    to be supportive of Ecous and their operation in Nigeria. I think at the most
                    senior levels of our command we understood the difficulties that some of these
                    African militaries and the UN had. When we were constructing the “African Crisis
                    Response Initiative,” we made a point of going to New York and meeting with the
                    UN peace keeping operations office to learn from them how they had internalized
                    in their own interaction review after Somalia and what procedures they were
                    attempting to develop to make their operation more effective in the future than
                    had been in the past. We went as representing the European Command but then we
                    also sent our Special Forces officer who worked on Africa out of the third group
                    of the Special Forces to meet at a more technical level. We had a series of
                    meeting during which we exchanged stacks of documents on how training was to be
                    done, what sort of procedures you establish, how you think about peace keeping
                    and humanitarian relief operations. The explicit objective in these exchanges
                    was to get as much harmonization between our schools of thought as we possibly
                    could so that, when we were training, we were training in a way that was
                    consistent with what the UN might ultimately do when it went into peace keeping
                    operations; we worked very hard at that. Again, I think we had a healthy respect
                    for the constraints under which the UN operated at the most senior levels.
                    Clearly when you went to see some of their operations that weren't working as
                    well as one would have liked, you bemoaned the fact that they didn't have the
                    authority they needed and they had all these problems dealing with it. But the
                    military again is very good at thinking about how do we fix problems.</p>

                        own European force. Was that something that was being bandied about while
                        you were there?</hi>

                <p>WILSON: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We went to talk to them in Brussels. We figured, what the hell, we should
                    be talking to them and figuring out what they were doing. This was about the
                    time that Mobutu was being overthrown and we were going to be conducting some
                    operations with the Belgians in any case. So we took the opportunity to talk to
                    European Union at the same time. Obviously there were a number of very serious
                    political issues.</p>
                <p>At the same time that we were dealing with this, we were also dealing with
                    France's reintegration to the NATO military command. The French were making
                    unrealistic demands, particularly considering that NATO had survived and had
                    indeed thrived without them for 35 years. They essentially wanted us to give
                    them control of the 6th Fleet. We always used to say the difference between the
                    French and the British is that the French wanted to use our equipment whereas
                    the British wanted to use our equipment and command our troops. We were not
                    going to give the French command of our equipment in the Mediterranean. The
                    French then started talking about the European Security and Defense Initiative;
                    there were some legitimate reasons to do so. The French and the Europeans
                    generally are nervous that one of these days the United States is going to
                    withdraw from European territory and the European collective defense system is
                    going to be the responsibility of the Europeans and, therefore, they ought to
                    begin to think their way through that potential development and staff for it
                    now. Realistically speaking, at a time of shrinking defense budgets, the chances
                    were that they were not going to be able to create a parallel European Security
                    and Defense Initiative without detracting from NATO capabilities and NATO's
                    ability to execute its mission. And, of course, the French response to this was
                    that, 'Well, we will just use NATO equipment if we go and do something under the
                    guise of the European Security and Defense Initiative'. The American position
                    was, 'over our dead bodies, because if you use NATO equipment, then you're
                    weakening NATO's ability to do what it has to do'. The Turkish had a different
                    take, which was what the Europeans are really talking about is that they will
                    provide command and control over Turkish ground troops, because Turkey had the
                    second largest army in NATO. The Turks could see what the European defense
                    budgets and defense policies were; there were very few soldiers on the ground
                    and, therefore, somebody was going to have provide them. So there were all these
                    issues that percolating up to the NATO level. Our concern was really more in the
                    context of combined joint task forces. Combined joint task forces basically
                    means that you have militaries from different countries and from different
                    services combined to operate jointly in a task force designed to solve a
                    problem. That's where we did things, that's what we thought about, how we would

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern or secret pleasure or something at that
                        time when, the growing disparity between the effectiveness of the American
                        military, particularly in the air with smart bombs and command and control
                        and all, and with the European forces, was so evident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: What we were most worried about was that the United States was getting so
                    far ahead of our European allies that fairly soon we were going to be unable to
                    operate togethei.e. that our interoperability was going to collapse. We were
                    concerned that we had just gotten ahead of the Europeans. We were concerned that
                    European budgets for defense and procurement cycles were just not going to keep
                    them at a state of readiness that would enable us to operate together as a NATO
                    force, and I think that remains a legitimate concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, were we doing anything
                        from the American side, as opposed to the NATO side, with Russia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, oh, yes. Again, most of this was taken care of out of Washington,
                    but we had a Russian three star over at NATO headquarters. George Gawin was
                    really proud that the Russian was at NATO headquarters and was working with NATO
                    at the operating level. We had Russian troops in Bosnia. We were always trying
                    to think about ways that we could do things with Russia. We even were trying to
                    figure out how we could get to Moscow from our command to try to build up that
                    relationship, but it was still jealously guarded by the chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, General Hugh Shelton, at the time. Very clearly within our command we
                    were looking at ways to work more closely with the Russians to bring the
                    Russians inside the tent at the operational level, and we were pretty
                    successfuGeorge was pretty successful. That was mostly done up in Mons and it
                    was mostly done under the NATO umbrella.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the relations with Israel from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We made one trip down to Israel when I was there. George and I went.
                    George went in his CINCEUR hat. That was the only trip I took with him, because
                    most everything else he did at that time was in a SACEUR hat. So he and I went
                    to Israel. We also had the Israeli chief of defense visit the European Command
                    while I was there and we also had the chief of the air force to our command
                    headquarters as part of his tours. One of the things we found about the Israelis
                    was that they tolerated us as the regional command, but it was pretty clear
                    that, if they didn't get what they wanted out of us, it didn't make much
                    difference because they would go right to the Pentagon. So they were
                    extraordinarily difficult as potential partners, because there was no sense of
                    shared need.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right, and the relationship between the Pentagon and Israel...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really wasn't the Pentagon. It was really between

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: All the branches of the US government. The Israelis did most of their
                    business directly with the Pentagon if they had business to do. Not having
                    served in the Pentagon, you might be absolutely right. Perhaps the Pentagon guys
                    feel exactly the same way, that they were superfluous...</p>
                <p>Q: Well, looking at the mega picture, the Pentagon has gotten very annoyed when
                    it had to provide equipment and all when they felt they really couldn't but with
                    Congress holding the purse strings and being the abject slave of the Israeli...,
                    anyway, the political process being what it is. We're both laughing here.</p>
                <p>WILSON: I think I'll let that one slide.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The only other thing we did is was to spend a lot of time with the Brits.
                    The Brits were just setting up their own joint command structure; so we were
                    over there and they were over with us quite a bit, working through how we might
                    work together. We started with the French, we moved over and started working
                    with the Brits, and then we started working with the Belgians, particularly as
                    it related to Kinshasa and the evacuation...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Africa was the easiest one because you didn't have the same sort of
                    political constituency groups looking over our shoulders; you could keep the
                    discussions at technical level. We had shared security interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had their own long term former colonial interest
                        and experiences there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>WILSON: They had responsibilities that made it easier to call upon them if we
                    needed to. It was in everybody's interest to do so. We ended up putting together
                    operations exercises where we observed and they observed, and we later did joint
                    exercises with them in Africa, in Zimbabwe and in Ghana, where they were the
                    leaders and we were observers in one and we were leaders and they were observers
                    in another. We deployed in a combined fashion in central Africa. We had troops
                    in both Gabon and in the Congo in the event that we had to evacuate Kinshasa.
                    The Brits were in Gabon. We had Belgians and French and ourselves and maybe some
                    Brits in the Congo. It was an interesting operation because we found, once we
                    had everybody there, that there were differences of opinion on how we should use
                    these troops. The French and the Belgians in particular were anxious to secure
                    Kinshasa so that there would be a minimal loss of life and so foreigners could
                    withdraw across the river in relative security...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Brazzaville or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: ...to Brazzaville. We were more reluctant because we felt that by
                    securing Kinshasa preemptively we would really not prevent but only postpone the
                    inevitable, which was the departure of Mobutu. Nobody had the stomach for
                    supporting Mobutu's continued stay in power in Kinshasa. We won out. The fall of
                    Kinshasa was peaceful. The Belgians and the French were unable to move without
                    us and could not keep Kabila from coming in. That was a source of political
                    friction with us later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Europeans saying, “You know, we depend on these
                        bloody Americans to use their air lift and all to get us there and support
                        us. Let's get our own,” or was the budgetary situation such in Europe that
                        it wasn't going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Air lifts are very expensive and always had to be negotiated. The large
                    issue was not so much that they depended on us but how difficult it was for them
                    to get it at a reasonable price. There was a lot of looking for alternative
                    strategic lifts. What the Europeans found out and what the UN found out as well
                    was that it was cheaper, more efficient, and less of a hassle to go to the
                    Ukrainians to provide the strategic lifts than it was to go to the U.S. Air
                    Force. I used to kid Jim Jamerson that, if you want to charter one of their
                    goddamn Air Force airplanes, you had to pay the Air Force budget for a year in
                    order to get it. It was outrageous. It was incompatible with everything that we
                    were trying to do to develop a sense of shared responsibility for these
                    operations. We took a whack at the cost issue a couple of timetrying to get this
                    problem solved in a way that was satisfactory to albut it was just too ingrained
                    to deal with. We made no headway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To move on then; in 1997 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>WILSON: At about the beginning of 1997, people started asking me what I wanted to
                    do. I started coming back to Washington to talk to people. Beginning about
                    February of that year I started getting queries about whether I'd be interested
                    in coming back to Washington, which I wasn't, but I was asked to come back, I
                    think, three times from February to April. Each time I was interviewed it was at
                    increasingly higher levels of the NSC. Finally I was offered my choice of either
                    being a special assistant to the president as the senior director for Africa
                    affairs at the National Security Council or being the principal deputy assistant
                    secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs. I chose the job at the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: For a couple reasons. One, I had never worked at the NSC and I thought it
                    would be fun to do that. Two, I thought that it would be more interesting being
                    head of the directorate than being the principal deputy. Three and perhaps most
                    importantly, I didn't think that over the long term the incoming assistant
                    secretary of State and I would be terribly compatible in terms of our policy
                    views.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Susan Rice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She came from the Hill, didn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. She had been at the NSC as a senior director, and prior to that she
                    had been in the Office of International Organizations, but she was an academic
                    who had worked on the Dukakis campaign and then on the Clinton campaign and had
                    moved from the campaign into a succession of positions at the National Security
                    Council and then over to the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were concerned about her management
                        style or her policy views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was principally her policies. I didn't know much about her management
                    style, although I learned a lot more about it as time passed. I thought that I
                    would be better positioned to influence policy at a competing pole rather than
                    under her. Frankly, I'd had a hell of a lot more experience than she had. She
                    was 34 years old, had never served overseas. I'd served in seven African posts.
                    There were a lot of things that she was doing that, as it turned out, were not
                    what I would have done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is also the endemic problem of somebody like
                        yourself, who's been around the block a long time in an area, and a new
                        person coming in without that experience. Being their deputy often doesn't
                        work very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I hadn't really looked at it in that context, but I suspect you're right.
                    I looked at it more in terms of how I could impact policy and where my efforts
                    could be best put to use. I had just come from the European Command where we had
                    restructured the way the command looked at threats. We had done a major push on
                    Africa. We had succeeded in a lot of different things, and I thought that it
                    would be interesting to try to run Africa policy from the White House. It was
                    fascinating; it was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at the NSC. In the first place, this was at the
                        beginning of the second Clinton administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Clinton was inaugurated in January of 1997, and I joined the NSC staff in
                    June of that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been watching it from Stuttgart looking at our
                        policy, how did you see the Clinton policy towards Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In Stuttgart, we were focusing mostly on how we could establish better
                    security relationships with African militaries and with the European militaries
                    dealing with African related issues. In that context, building on some of the
                    really disasters of previous years, notably Somalia and Rwanda, we had been
                    thinking about how to make African militaries more capable of responding to
                    crises within Africa, understanding that the UN system is very slow to react and
                    understanding that the American political system is even slower to develop the
                    political will necessary to take action unilaterally. We were working on a piece
                    of the agendi.e. the security piece of the overall African agenda. Part of that
                    was conflict resolution, which is and continues to be a major preoccupation of
                    anybody who deals with Africa. We were involved in supporting our diplomatic
                    efforts to resolve the Liberia crisis and subsequently Sierra Leone, both of
                    which had gone through difficult civil wars. We provided the security
                    underpinning for the fall of Mobutu in the Congo to make sure that there was not
                    a vacuum in Kinshasa as he left and before Kabila came to power. We were
                    involved in evacuating various embassies, one of them being in the Central
                    African Republic. We continued to maintain, and we developed really, a whole new
                    set of working relationships with European militaries so that we could operate
                    more effectively in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>Going from there to Washington and the National Security Council, there were many
                    other issues that we were taking a look at as well. In terms of the Clinton
                    administration's policy proclamations on Africa, there was very little for me to
                    really criticize. I thought that they fit very nicely with my view after 25
                    years of experience in Africa.</p>
                <p>I always thought that Africa deserved a little higher place in our foreign policy
                    constellation than it typically got from administrations and from Congress
                    frankly. Administrations, being responsible for foreign policy, are always
                    interested in it. Congress, being responsible for the expenditure and
                    appropriation of monies, are always less interested in it than they are in other
                    matters. The president was partly, I think, making a silk purse out of a sow's
                    ear because experience had taught us that this was probably the right way to go.
                    He had decided on a course which emphasized the private sector as the engine of
                    development over governmental assistance. When I say 'making a silk purse out of
                    a sow's ear,' I mean that it was pretty clear that Senator Jesse Helms was never
                    going to give the Department of State or USAID anything like the sort of monies
                    that was needed to run an effective assistance program. His favorite phrase was,
                    “It's money down a rat hole.” So faced with no more money for public investment
                    activities, we came up with another formula, which was to emphasize private
                    sector involvement and then try to get the private sector more engaged in
                    investments in Africa. I must say that there were a lot of examples of public
                    sector programs in Africa that hadn't worked. I would argue that you probably
                    had no more AID failures than you had in any other area. If you consider the
                    rate of business failureroughly nine out of every 10 businesses that start up
                    faithere were more AID successes, I think, that one in 10 of the projects. If
                    you talk to people who worked Africa for 30 years, they and everybody else will
                    acknowledge that Africa has been in a prolonged economic decline, but those who
                    worked in specific regions would argue that, very much thanks to the efforts of
                    the international community, the quality of life has not declined to the same
                    extent that the economic productivity has declined in Africa. Whether that's a
                    good thing or not, I don't know, but if you talk to people who worked on the
                    SaheI was in the Sahel in 197they will tell you that at that time the
                    conventional wisdom was that people would not be able to survive in the Sahel
                    within 25 years. In fact, they have survived and they've grown, and production
                    has grown to meet population growth. While they've not thrived, they've at least
                    managed to stay afloat.</p>
                <p>Q: As you looked at that from the perspective of the 1990s, were there actions
                    that we took that were useful?</p>
                <pb facs="0269" n="Page0269"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think we've done a lot that has been very useful in the Sahel. I think
                    we've done a lot to help develop strains of crops that do better in that
                    environment than what had been traditionally grown. We helped to set up
                    distribution systems. We've helped to build a basic infrastructure which allowed
                    people to function more easily, enhancing economic productivity. We had been
                    involved both through AID and through Peace Corps in programs designed to assist
                    health systems at the basic village level in ways that hadn't been done before.
                    I think all of that has been a net plus. Whether it's going to solve the
                    fundamental problems of governance and how you deal with self sustainability, I
                    just don't know; time will tell. We're still really in the first generation
                    after colonialism, or the beginning of the second generation, and 40 years is
                    not a long time in the history of a country. If you think back, in the 14th and
                    15th centuries, some of these West African countries were the centers of
                    tremendous accomplishment. Mali, for example, was one of the centers of Islamic
                    publishing. Timbuktu was a great publishing center in the 15th century. This
                    present cycle has been particularly debilitating for those of us who have been
                    alive during it and for those of us who have worked in and for Africa as well as
                    for Africans. I actually think I would give AID and the role of public sector
                    investment a much higher grade than Jesse Helms does, but then I would probably
                    view most foreign policy issues differently from the senator. I also think and
                    have thought that it is in fact in our strategic interest to be active in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>We had at the NSC made the argument that we needed to defend ourselves against
                    threats that might emanate from Africa because failed nation states might become
                    havens for terrorists or international criminal activities. You see that very
                    clearly in Afghanistan as that particular scenario has played out rather vividly
                    in the year 2001. I think increasingly we need to focus on health issues of a
                    pandemic nature, whether it's AIDS or whether it's some of these exotic viruses
                    such as the Bola that are currently isolated in Africa but could well expand
                    beyond that. So there's lots of reasons to be involved there. But quite apart
                    from the threats that we might be defending ourselves against, I think that we
                    have to recognize the opportunities that the African continent presents. It is
                    the largest land mass that has yet to be put into production in a meaningful way
                    as a contribution to the global economic well being. Within the borders of the
                    continent of Africa you could put the entire United States, most of Western
                    Europe, a good part of South Asia, and Australia, and still have room left over.
                    It is home to enormous natural resources. People continue to say that the oil in
                    West Africa offshore, off the countries from Angola to Nigeria, could well be as
                    much as the oil in the Arabian Gulf. And there are all the basic minerals and
                    metals on the continent. In addition to that, you have a population of something
                    over 700 million that fundamentally live on international largesse. One of our
                    largest exports to Africa when I first went therthis could still be the caswere
                    used clothing. They lived on international donations and mafia controlled used
                    clothing from the United States. The challenge is to make these 700 million
                    people productive so that they actually contribute to, rather than be a drain
                    on, the global wealth. Furthermore a market of 700 million would be a market of
                    a size that would entice anybody, as we've seen in the case of China since the
                    opening of China 10, 15, 20 years ago.</p>

                        administrative phase, was as a political observer. When you came to the
                        NSyou're the new boy on the blochow did you size up this creature, the
                        National Security Council, as a political entity at the time you were there
                        in 1997? What was making it tick? What were some of the dynamics within it
                        from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I got there in 1997, it was a time for some change in the U.S.
                    government foreign policy team. Tony Lake had left and was replaced by Sandy
                    Berger, who was particularly close to the president politically and had already
                    been the deputy national security advisor for four years. He was well anchored
                    in his relationship with the president and knew how the NSC functioned. At the
                    State Department, Warren Christopher had departed and Madeleine Albright had
                    just gotten there. His undersecretary for political affairs, Michael Armacost,
                    had also just left and been replaced by Tom Pickering. Pickering was an
                    experienced officer, but he had not been in Washington in quite a while. He'd
                    been in New York and then he'd been overseas and then in the Bureau of African
                    Affairs. I arrived and at the same time I arrived Johnny Carson arrived. He was
                    our ambassador in Uganda before he coming back to Washington. The assistant
                    secretary had not yet been confirmed, in fact had not yet had a hearing. That
                    waDr. Rice, who was on maternity leave having a baby.</p>
                <p>The president was planning to go to Africa. As a consequence, at about the time
                    of my arrival, power was shifting from other agencies to the NSC. It was being
                    centralized in the NSC even though we didn't have the horses to do all the
                    demarches and all the cables. But we certainly were able to make decisions and
                    compel their implementation. So that worked pretty well. We were able to take
                    some actions and we were able to stop some actions that other people might have
                    wanted to take but which we didn't think was in our interest to do so. I think
                    the power pretty much resided in the NSC during the second Clinton term.
                    Whenever there were key questions or matters of interests to the principals, it
                    was the NSC that had a lot of the influence on how those decisions were going to
                    be made. We chaired a lot of the interagency groups that worked on issues.
                    Assistance to the Congo, for example, was one issue that was preoccupying us
                    because there was a population of 47 million people in essentially a political
                    vacuum. How were they going to survive the rough transition they were embarked
                    upon was a good example. We were key players right at the time I left in the
                    Ethiopian Eritrean conflict; we were the ones who hammered out the agreements
                    necessary to demarcate cease fire lines and things like that. The reasons we in
                    the NSC African directorate retained a fair amount of influence during the time
                    I was there was, one, there was a void in the State Department; two, we had the
                    trip and so...</p>
                <p>Q: You might talk a little about how a presidential trip really gives everybody a
                    chance to strut their stuff and to focus policy and everything else.</p>
                <pb facs="0271" n="Page0271"/>
                <p>WILSON: There's nothing that quite focuses a mind like a presidential trip, and
                    I'll get to that. Then, three, Dr. Rice was such a controversial figure within
                    the bureaucracy that we were seeing people gravitated towards us to get our
                    support in their battles against whatever the State Department might be trying
                    to do. That allowed us to maintain a fair amount of influence during the time I
                    was at the NSC. That influence ebbed because Rice had her political contacts
                    throughout the bureaucracy that dated back to the various campaigns (she was
                    also Albright's goddaughter); so once the trip was over, and particularly after
                    I left the NSC, she was able to reassert the primacy of her position, which was
                    unfortunate but that's the way it was.</p>
                <p>As for the president's trip, I got to the NSC in June. The issues that we were
                    focusing on included the Sudan. That was one of our first issuewhether or not we
                    were going to put an ambassador back in the Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what the situation was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                <p>WILSON: We had had some intelligence that suggested that the Sudanese were going
                    to do something against our interests, either in Washington or in Khartoum or
                    somewhere in the area. Everybody was very, very sensitive to what the Sudanese
                    were up to since they had in the past been a safe haven for international
                    terrorists including Carvos and including at one point Osama bin Laden. From
                    Sudanese territory had come the assassination attempt against President Mubarak
                    and one in Addis Ababa. They were in the throes of establishing an Islamic
                    government in Khartoum. They were prosecuting the civil war against the
                    southerners with great vigor and enthusiasm including bombing of civilians and
                    the harassment of humanitarian relief efforts. They were enslaving people,
                    things like that. So they were in pretty foul odor in Washington. In fact, as a
                    result of one of these intelligence pieces of information we had gotten, we had
                    decided to withdraw our ambassador and all of our diplomatic staff from Khartoum
                    because we were afraid for their safety. When I arrived at the NSC, there was a
                    certain amount of interest, particularly in the State Department in putting an
                    ambassador back in Khartoum. I think the State Department was quite correct in
                    its view. Their analysis was that we ought to be there, that the intelligence
                    reports on which we had acted had proven to be flawed, and in fact all the
                    reports that we had acted upon were withdrawn from the system, which means that
                    essentially they were discredited. So the rationale for not having an ambassador
                    there no longer existed, and the Department felt that we should have somebody in
                    the Sudan as a platform for collecting information and as a flag of moral
                    support to people who would want to undermine the government in Khartoum itself,
                    and to perform the necessary embassy services. The trouble was the State
                    Department decided that it was within the purview of the secretary of State to
                    open and close embassies and to send personnel out to these embassies and that
                    it was not a White House prerogativa mistake on their part. They decided they
                    would push the issue by taking advantage of my recent arrival and by just
                    circumventing the White House completely by just briefing Congress and briefing
                    the press and doing it over a weekena slow news weekend. The person who was
                    spearheading this was my old ambassador in Baghdad, April Glaspie, who was then
                    the head of the office of eastern African affairs. They started taking actions
                    necessary to reopen a post; we got wind of that and made the determination that
                    since the decision to close down the embassy had been made by an interagency
                    committee chaired by the NSC, and since it was related to security and terrorism
                    and not to foreign policy, the decision to restaff the embassy had to be
                    considered by that same committee that had considered closing it down. We pushed
                    this view late on a Friday afternoon, and over the weekend we forced the State
                    Department to back down, which was seen by some as a black eye for Tom Pickering
                    and for Madeleine, particularly for Pickering, and for April Glaspie. I told
                    them on Monday exactly what I just saithat the issue was not the merits of
                    putting an ambassador back there; the problem was the process through which they
                    went. I called Pickering directly and told him that my office would support
                    putting an ambassador back in Khartoum if the Department wanted to raise that
                    question again through the appropriate committee structure. They never did while
                    I was there. They were still licking their wounds about the issue a year later,
                    which was too bad.</p>

                        showing your stuff rather than being practica“let's get an ambassador in
                        there?” It was seen as a way of exerting authority of the secretary, do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. By the secretary's staff, Pickering and certainly April Glaspie.
                    They had some good reasons for doing so; they were of the opinion that we should
                    have an ambassador back there, a view which I shared. They did not believe, for
                    some reason, that they could succeed in achieving their objective by going
                    through the committee system that had made the original decision; so they were
                    going to circumvent it. It became an issue of whether a department could
                    circumvent a system that was in place. Since the issue concerned security
                    matters and American lives, we had no choice but to oppose it on procedural
                    grounds. We had to have CIA input, we had to have Department of State inpuother
                    than the Office of East African Affairto make sure that the issue was properly
                    vetted. That was kind of an interesting issue.</p>
                <p>The first six months in the NSC we were occupied with Sudan. We ended up
                    enhancing the sanctions against Sudan, which I did support because at that time
                    Sudan still appeared to be a country that was allowing its territory to be used
                    by international terrorists and, therefore, posed a direct threat to our
                    national security interest and, as such, should be subject to economic
                    sanctions.</p>
                <p>A couple of the other big issues were Congo. We took the position that, whether
                    you liked Kabila or noand nobody particularly liked Kabila, who was the person
                    who had replaced Mobutu as presidenthat you had to, one, consider the
                    geostrategic location of the Congo in central and west Africa and, two, you had
                    to consider what the consequences would be if it were allowed to fall into even
                    greater chaos with its population of 47 million people. We worked very hard to
                    put together an AID program. We called it a “hub and spoke.” We didn't have a
                    base in Kinshasa; we had hubs throughout the provinces, so we tried to have this
                    run, despite Kabila and his people in Kinshasa. At that time he was defying the
                    international community on such things as whether there would be international
                    investigations into genocidal type massacres that had taken place in the country
                    during the war that brought him to power. There was a lot of concern that an
                    awful lot of people had been killed bringing him to power. Some of the people
                    may have been his people, some may not have been people. But Kabila didn't want
                    anybody poking around in that sordid affair. We were fending off a Congress that
                    wanted to make sure that the investigation went forward, and was trying to use
                    our assistance program as leverage to force Kabila to allow access to the Congo
                    for the UN Human Rights Commission. We resisted that. Other issues included
                    Angola.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I was at the NSC at a very interesting time. We had the UN Secretary
                    General's special representative, Blondin Bay, the former Malian foreign
                    minister. We were shuttling throughout the region. As I mentioned earlier, I had
                    worked with him when I was in Gabon and knew him quite well. We had flown
                    together, we traveled together, we had seen Bongo together, and what not. We had
                    put together some meetings between the UNITA military structure and the
                    government's military people. While at EURCOM I had been in Angola; I would go
                    there every couple of months. When I was assigned to the NSC, we were pretty
                    much finished with the disarming process, quartering and then trying to retrain
                    UNITA people so they could be part of the broader Angolan society. This was all
                    part of the Lusaka process and the cease fire. The Angolan government was
                    extending its reach into the countryside peacefully. They had formed a
                    parliament that included members of UNITA who had been sent from Savimbi's
                    headquarters as part of the Lusaka process. Events were moving towards a cease
                    fire, but at the same time when I was there we were getting disturbing signs
                    that Savimbi had gone as far as he was going to go and was not going to take the
                    next step and that in fact his actions to date were perhaps a ploy that he could
                    use to give himself a little bit of time while he in fact was importing arms and
                    materiel at a dangerous rate. We began to look for ways to try to bring some
                    additional pressure to bear on Savimbi, including sanctions on a rebel party.
                    The Clinton administration from its beginning had sought to improve relations
                    with Rwanda, and I think that that was right. We proceed on a pace with that in
                    mind. As a consequence, Savimbi had become sort of increasingly isolated from
                    the American body politic. In the post Cold War period he was no longer the
                    darling of the right that he had been before. But Angola remained an ongoing
                    problem, trying to support the UN Secretary General's personal representative
                    and trying to put into place the right mixture of incentives and disincentives
                    to try to get Savimbi and UNITA to really moving forward in the integration
                    process. We remained committed to UNITA playing a full role in the Angolan
                    political process. We did not want to see UNITA disappear completely. We wanted
                    to see it transformed from a rebel guerilla movement into a thriving political
                    party representing the interests of the population that supported Savimbi. We
                    never quite got there from here, but it was not for lack of trying. Savimbi's a
                    tough nut.</p>
                <p>Then in West Africa we had a number of things going on. We had Nigeria which was
                    in the clutches of a very bad Nigerian general, Sani Abacha, who was stealing
                    the country blind to the tune of several tens of millions of dollars that were
                    disappearing from the economy. There was pressure building. Also in West Africa
                    you had the phenomenon of Charles Taylor in Liberia, and then we had the RUF
                    (Revolutionary United Front) in Sierra Leone which was a horrible group of
                    thugs, with no political agenda whatsoever. They just terrorized their
                    population in the most despicable fashion, cutting off legs and limbs and
                    arms...</p>

                <p>WILSON: ...small children. They just terrorized the civilian population, and had
                    literally had no political agenda. Those were some of the issues that we faced.
                    The president was keenly interested in Africa. He had issued his “Partnership
                    for Growth and Opportunity” in June of 1997 just as I arrived at the NSC, which
                    was, I think, the most comprehensive guide to us who were looking at how we were
                    going to deal with Africa. It was predicated on getting the private sector much
                    more involved and using our governmentgovernment relationships to create within
                    Africa a new set of priorities that would encourage rather than discourage
                    international and domestic private sector investment. We were very supportive of
                    the “African Growth and Opportunity Act,” which was then being considered by a
                    committee in the House. We wanted to see that passed because that would provide
                    the legislative underpinning to what we were trying to achieve. In fact that was
                    the first piece of legislation that actually dealt with what American approach
                    to Africa should look like. It offered a series of incentive by opening access
                    to U.S. markets for Africa importAfrican exports to the United States. I think
                    that in the first couple of years since its passage, we actually have seen
                    African imports to the United States increase by about 10 20 percent; I think
                    that that's a good thing. The “African Growth and Opportunity Act” does have
                    incentives: if a country takes certain actions, then it will get greater access
                    to U.S. markets than if it doesn't; if a country pursues sound economic and
                    public administration policies, then the United States will be more inclined to
                    support debt reductioactions like that. It was to be accompanied by annual
                    ministerials and periodic summits with those countries that have done the best.
                    It was all predicated on sort of best business practices, and it made sense to
                    do so. That was the underpinning and that was the environment in which we
                    worked. Then around Christmas time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christmas of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It would be Christmas of 1997; it was actually right after Christmas, in
                    early January 1998. We got a call from the White House's domestic issues stafthe
                    President's schedulersaying, “If you want, we can give you the last two weeks in
                    March for the president's trip to Africa, or you can have the last two weeks in
                    August, but we can't be certain that the president will not want to take a
                    vacation in the last two weeks of August; so if you want sure dates you can have
                    the last two weeks of March, or you can roll the dice and bet that the president
                    would prefer to go to Africa rather than to Martha's Vineyard the last two weeks
                    of August. Before you make your decision, you should know that typically it
                    takes six months to organize a presidential trip. You decide if you want to do a
                    presidential trip in two and a half months..” We said, “Oh, yes, absolutely,
                    we'll do it. We'll just telescope everything and do it.” And we did. We learned
                    on a Thursday or Friday that we could schedule the trip for the last two weeks
                    of March. About Wednesday of the following week, a captivated American public
                    watched as a breathless Sam Donaldson stood on the lawn of the White House and
                    said, “If it proves true that the president had a sexual relationship with an
                    intern, he'll be out of here within 48 hours.” As we were watching this, we were
                    wondering, “What's going to happen to our trip?.”</p>

                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. It broke just literally days after we had been told that we
                    should start planning for a trip in March. For us this, trip was a major event;
                    for anybody who has worked on Africa this trip was a major event. It turned out
                    to be the most significant visit to the continent of Africa that any president
                    since the founding of our republic had ever taken. It was only the second time a
                    president of the United States has set foot on Africa, at least on Sub Saharan
                    African territory, for the express purpose of visiting with African leaders.
                    Roosevelt had been there on his way to Morocco; I think his plane refuel in
                    Liberia or close by. Jimmy Carter had traveled to Liberia and Nigeria in his
                    around the world tour of emerging nations. George Bush had stopped in Somalia to
                    see the troops at the very end of his administration. Other than that, no
                    American president had gone to Africa. So we got the trip. The president got
                    splattered with the Monica Lewinski scandal the following Wednesday; by the
                    following Saturday we were in the Oval Office while the president was calling
                    Nelson Mandela to ask him if March 26th or 27th was a good date to visit South
                    Africa; that was going to be the centerpiece of our trip and was going to be a
                    state visit. The president got on the phone with Nelson Mandela. My deputy,
                    Robin Sanders, and I were sitting in the Oval Office with the president. The
                    speaker phone was on so we could hear the conversation. The president is sitting
                    at his desk; Mandela comes on, and the president says, “Hi. Just wanted to go
                    over a couple things.” He has got three talking points. “I want to come to
                    Africa. Is March 28th good for you? This is what we're looking forward to.”
                    Basically, that was it. All Mandela wanted to talk about was Monica Lewinski,
                    and more than that, all he really wanted to do was to spend the whole time
                    telling the president how everybody in Africa loves him and what a terrible
                    thing it was that was happening to him. What is the press doing undermining him
                    with this stupid scandal, etc? Every time the Mandela began to speak, President
                    Clinton opened his mouth to say, “Well, gee, I really just want to come March
                    28th. Would that work for you?” Mandela interrupts and says, “Mr. President, we
                    all support you. All of Africa supports you. What the press is doing to you is
                    horrible.” This went on about five times. We are sitting in the Oval Office
                    listening while the president was undergoing this sort of water torture, Chinese
                    water torture, at the hands of Nelson Mandela. I am kind of looking at my feet,
                    I am looking at the ceiling, I am looking all around just praying that we could
                    move on and get to the president's talking points and then leave the Oval
                    Office. I finally looked at the president, who by this time had his head pretty
                    much in his arms, holding the phone leaning against one arm on one elbow,
                    waiting for Mandela to get done with his expressions of passionate support in
                    the face of this assault on his character. We finally got through that and we
                    got approval of the visit date and the President hangs up. Robin and I get up
                    and we start shuffling out the door. “That was a great phone call, Mr.
                    President. Thanks very much. See you later.” We are trying to get out. The
                    president gets up and walks around the desk and blocks our way and says, “This
                    is going to be a great trip, isn't it?” That got us thinking about the trip and
                    not about Nelson Mandela and not about Monica, so Robin and I ended up spending
                    about another 20 minutes sharing with the president discussing our various
                    experiences in Africa. Robin had served in Sudan and in Senegal and I had served
                    in many other places; so we regaled the president with stories of Africa for
                    about 20 minutes. After I left, I thought about the meeting for awhile, and it
                    became clear that there were a couple things that happened in the Oval Office.
                    For one, we had had this just wonderful opportunity to spend 20 minutes with the
                    president of the United States on a subject about which we were passionate; we
                    got him jazzed up to go to Africa. Secondly, it was pretty clear that the
                    president, always a politician, did not want us leaving the Oval Office with our
                    last thoughts being of his rather difficult and embarrassing conversation with
                    Nelson Mandela; succeeded in that, because as we left, all we were thinking
                    about was what a great trip we were going to have.</p>
                <pb facs="0278" n="Page0278"/>
                <p>When you plan a presidential trip, everybody gets involveeverybody who thinks
                    they have a claim on the president's heart and mind even if they don't. By
                    everybody, I mean everybody from the Secret Service to the president's staff
                    that worries about the domestic agenda, who did not like the idea of the
                    president going out of the country during a key part of the legislative calendar
                    and who argued that we should scale the trip back to six or five or four days,
                    and that we should make three stops instead of six stops, and that we should do
                    this, that and the other thing. The State Department had its views. As we
                    programmed the trip, we would rise every morning, go to the office to argue
                    about which five or six places we wanted to go on the trip. We get that settled
                    by nine o'clock that night. We would then go home, come back the next morning
                    and start all over again. Should we go to Ethiopia or should we go to Uganda?
                    Should we go to Ghana or should we go to Nigeria? Would we go here or would we
                    go there? Everybody had something that they wanted to say about that; those who
                    shouted loud enough and made their points clearly enough, would get their way.
                    In the end, we agreed on those things that we had essentially agreed upon in the
                    first hours of our planning process, and that was that the overriding objective
                    of this trip was going to be to show a picture of Africa to the American people
                    unlike any picture most of them had ever seen about Africa. For the last 20
                    years or probably since the massacres of the Belgian sisters in Zaire in the
                    civil war of the 1960s, Americans have seen really nothing but the most horrible
                    pictures of Africa, whether it was famine or disease or war or other disasters.
                    We wanted to change that image. We wanted a picture that was more representative
                    of the Africa that those of us that worked in Africa knew. Basically that meant
                    showing other images of Africa and using the president's presence in Africa to
                    showcase those. Secondly, we wanted to make the point that African countries
                    which followed the best political, business and economic practices would benefit
                    from the prestige of an American presidential visit; so we looked for countries
                    that had actually undertaken political and economic reforms, where there were
                    democratic movements or emerging political cultures, and where there had been a
                    sustained period of economic growth as a consequence of past economic and
                    management decisions. Those were issues that we factored into the decision of
                    what places to visit. We also came up with a number of additional issues that we
                    wanted to showcase and we matched countries to those issues. We wanted the
                    president to have a good time; so we wanted him to go to a game park and we
                    wanted to underscore the richness of the African environment. In the end, I got
                    my way on everything. We understood that we could not go to Africa without
                    addressing one of the arcs of crisis either in West Africa or in Central Africa
                    going from Angola through the Great Lakes region of Africa. The question was
                    where were we going to do it. Every ambassador came to see me to plead his or
                    her special case as to why the president should go to their country and not
                    somewhere else. Jesse Jackson went to the president a couple times to get him to
                    go to Zimbabwe. We said no. The Secret Service told us that we couldn't fly into
                    Rwanda. We had a special meeting with the Secret Service to tell them why we
                    could, and we did. We set up a summit meeting in Entebe, Uganda, to which we had
                    invited a number of regional African leaders to discuss the crisis in Central
                    Africa. We had major debates as to whether you would invite Daniel Arap Moi, the
                    President of Kenya, or Laurent Kabila, the president of the Congo, with one
                    faction saying, “You can't do that because these are despicable characters,
                    dictators,” etc. We said, “You have to do it because, after all, these guys are
                    figures who represent power bases in their continent and, after all, the
                    president is going to have an opportunity to act as our senior diplomat to
                    advance an agenda that will be helpful to us.” We won on that. We got the
                    president to go to Botswana. We arranged that in such a way that it occurred
                    right on the day that the peaceful transition of power was taking place in
                    Botswana from one president, who was retiring, to his vice president; so we were
                    there for that. We took the president to one of the most magnificent game parks
                    in Southern Africa in Mawana called the Chobay Game Park along Chobay River. I
                    made two trips in preparation for the president's journey. I had to explain to
                    the prime minister of Ethiopia why we were not going to the seat of the OAU and,
                    why we were going to Kampala, and than I took another trip to Angola to deliver
                    a message on behalf of the president in support of the peace efforts in Angola.
                    In the end, we settled on Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana, and
                    Senegal on the way out; we had different themes that we underscored for each
                    stop. We put together this trip. It turned out to be 11 days long. It was the
                    longest time that the president spent out of the country in his eight years in
                    office. It was the most significant trip that he made in terms of number of
                    countries visited and time spent. It was probably the most difficult trip that
                    any administration had ever undertaken, just because the infrastructure in
                    Africa is so poor that you pretty much have to do everything yourself. You had
                    to have communications, you had to have vehicles, you had to bring everything
                    with you; they were basically stand alone trips. I think the president will tell
                    you to this day that it was the best trip he ever made.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: His daughter did not go. Hillary went, and he took a number of Cabinet
                    officials. We also took members of the House African Affairs Subcommittee
                    including is chairman, who was a Republican. We took Jesse Jackson with us. We
                    took my old boss at European Command, General Jamerson. We took members of the
                    Black Caucus. We took one American businessman, Bob Johnson, head of BET. There
                    was another delegation that went to a ceremony that the president presided over
                    which was the opening of our commercial center in Johannesburg, South Africa. We
                    had Air Force One for 11 days, and Air Force One takes generally a delegation of
                    40 to 46 people. We visited Ghana. One of the big debates we had was where the
                    President was going to make his speech in Ghana. The Secret Service had gone
                    there and the advance people had gone there, and they had chosen this big
                    square, Independence SquarBlack Star Square it was called. You needed to have up
                    to 500,000 people in it to make it look full. There was some concern that if the
                    president of the United States was there with only had 25,000 people in the
                    square, it would look like nobody had come out. So they suggested this other
                    square which would only hold about 25,000 people. The Ghanaians were saying that
                    we couldn't do that, that we had to hold the ceremony in the big square because
                    this is where they did all their major functions. They argued this issue back
                    and forth, and finally we held a meeting. I had delegated this part out; finally
                    the tie had to be broken and I went in and sat down with the most senior people
                    on the advance staff and said, “Look, I've been in Africa 25 years. I have seen
                    the Pope. I've seen Omar Qadhafi come to Africa. I can guarantee you the
                    president of the United States is going to draw 500,000 people to that square.”
                    That won the case, and we put him in the big square. Hell, there were 500,000
                    people on the streets from the airport just going to the square and another
                    500,000 people in the square for the president. The president drew enormous
                    amounts of energy from the population there, so it was wonderful. It was a great
                    way to start the...</p>

                    primary objective. Our goal was to send back a positive image of Africa. We made
                    that really one of our operating principles.</p>

                <p>WILSON: We felt, and I do feeand we were criticized for “all show and no
                    substance”that that was the only way that you were ever going to get a
                    constituency supporting Africa, which is what we needed. It was not enough for
                    Chet Crocker to say, “Africa is important; therefore, I'm going to work on
                    Africa.” You need a constituency which is going to say, “We need more of this or
                    that policy towards Africa. We need people to have positive views towards Africa
                    and U.S. involvement in Africa. So we wanted the “show;” we saw this as a main
                    way of educating Americans about a continent that was far more complex than what
                    they usually see watching CNN. We looked for every good shot, whether it was
                    thousands of Africans cheering the president of the United States in Ghana or
                    whether it was the president walking hand in hand with a couple school kids
                    outside Kampala, Uganda. Absolutely, we wanted people to see that Africans are
                    human beings, that they had the same concerns that Americans did. We wanted the
                    president to be seen with African families, with African children, with African
                    leaders, with victims of genocide as well as with productive business
                    entrepreneurs.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Once we got out of Washington, it was fine because the journalist who
                    traveled with the president were people who were going to write about Africa;

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sandy was on the trip. When we planned the trip, it was ours to build;
                    our offices were in charge of the substance; we had only occasional debates or
                    disputes on the substance or on where we were going to go. There was some
                    question about to the value of going to Rwanda because there were those in the
                    administration who didn't want to be reminded of our slowness to act in 199'our'
                    being the international communities including the United States.</p>

                <p>WILSON: That was the genocide in Rwanda that had amounted to about 800,000 deaths
                    of Rwandan citizens. The international community had largely stood by and not
                    reacted. We pushed argued against the “no go” position and won that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the background of getting this out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The question was why would we go to Rwanda which might bring up yet again
                    an opportunity for the press to write articles about the American failure to
                    react quickly when genocide was taking place. We said, “You cannot go to Africa
                    and ignore the crisis in Central Africa, and clearly the place that we ought to
                    address this issue should be Rwanda. You have to render homage to the victims of
                    the genocide.” Finally we got everybody to agree to that. We got the Secret
                    Service to agree to the flying in, but the concession we made was that we
                    wouldn't leave the airport. We moved the whole program out to the airport so
                    that we wouldn't expose the president to the streets. There was a lot of
                    concern, because there were still a lot of Rwandan Hutus who had been in power
                    and then had been overthrown in the aftermath of the genocide, but they were
                    still around. They were principally on the Congo side but they could
                    infiltrate.</p>

                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>WILSON: Two presidents had been shot down landing in Rwanda. Then the question
                    became what was the president going to say and what was he going to do. We
                    wanted him to meet with survivors of the genocide, not so much to hear from them
                    how bad things had been and how they were suffering, although it was clear he
                    was going to hear some of that, but to hear and see how they had managed to put
                    their lives back together in the aftermath of this really horrible tragedwhat it
                    had been like for them to move back to their villages, to live back with their
                    neighbors, some of whom had been responsible for the killing of their family
                    members. The second question was what was the President going to say, and we had
                    a number of formulations. As we were flying into Kigali, the president was
                    reviewing the speech that we had drafted for him and called Hillary, Sandy,
                    Susan Rice and myself into his office. We sat there and went over the speech
                    line by line. The important words were, “Never again will we stand by and allow
                    a genocide to occur without reacting;” the question was: Can you really say
                    'never again' to genocide? There were two schools of thought on the plane. One
                    school was, “Mr, President, you can't say 'never again' because you're
                    committing the United States to do something that the United States might not be
                    able to do, and in any case your government has not agreed that we would do
                    this.” In other words, there hadn't been a series of interagency meetings; there
                    hadn't been a decision memorandum forcing the U.S. government to make a decision
                    as to how it would act in the face of a genocide in the future. That was the
                    Sandy Berger side. I know that Sandy may not have felt this way personally, but
                    he was the defender of the process designed that the president did not get so
                    far out in front of his government which might not really act upon commitments
                    he might have made. That was the prudent approach. Then there was the other
                    side, which I articulated, which posited that if there was ever an opportunity
                    for the president to provide direction to his government, this was the time and
                    this was the issue. If the president didn't direct his government to address
                    this question, his government would never come to him with a decision
                    memorandum, because you could never get the Pentagon to buy into this as a
                    mission and, in the absence of directing the Pentagon to undertake this study,
                    they would never allow this issue even to raised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Kosovo an issue at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0283" n="Page0283"/>
                <p>WILSON: No, Kosovo was not an issue at that time, although down the road it was
                    going to be. Clearly Bosnia had been an issue; we had lived through Bosnia. The
                    military didn't like the Bosnia operation. The Congress didn't like Bosnia. I
                    remember being in Stuttgart when Senator Stevens of Alaska came and said, “If
                    you guys go into Bosnia, you're be training with plywood tanks next year,
                    because you won't get any money for your budget.” The military view was that
                    Bosnia didn't fit nicely into our two “major wars” doctrine and, therefore, we
                    couldn't do it unless we trained and had resources and had everything that goes
                    along with ithe same arguments they've used to not get involved in the war on
                    drugs, the same argument they used before September 11th not to be assigned a
                    lead responsibility in the war on terrorism. The discussion got really
                    passionate. Hillary was asking key questions. Susan was weighing in with her
                    views. The president was listening to all of this, and people were screaming and
                    yelling and talking loudly. The next thing we knew, the plane had landed and we
                    were all still sitting or standing there as the plane landed. Nobody had buckled
                    up or anything. The president was still at his desk and he hasn't buckled
                    himself in. We just landed in Kigali, Rwanda. The president says, “Thank you
                    very much,” and we left, not knowing what the president was going to say. We got
                    off the plane. The president met with the survivors of genocide and had his
                    meetings with the president and the vice president of Rwanda. Then he moved to
                    where he was going to speak. I'd gone ahead of him. I had not attended the
                    survivor meetings; I had gone ahead to where he was going to speak. I was going
                    to be responsible for spinning the press, talking to the press about what he
                    said in his speech and making sure they understood what he meant. The president
                    entered and stood at the podium and he started into his speech. Suddenly I heard
                    what he was saying; it was not written in his speech. He had just spoke
                    extemporaneously. He had discarded his text, and was very clearly speaking based
                    on what he had seen and what he concluded from his meeting with the survivors of
                    the genocide, which fit in very nicely with his overall theme. I think one of
                    his guiding philosophies about the human condition was that one major challenge
                    was to draw strength from diversity rather than using diversity or using
                    different ethnicity as an excuse to destroy each other. It was truly a moving
                    speech. People who were sitting around me were all in tears. I myself was having
                    great difficulty swallowing. I got up and walked out because I was really choked
                    up, and I don't usually get that way. I was standing in the area between where
                    the president was giving his speech, the antechamber, and then a walkway to
                    where the press was. The president left the room where he had spoken. Everybody
                    else is still in the room. The president came around from behind the screen, and
                    there's only two people in this sort of holding area. One is the president of
                    the United States and the other one was me. There was nobody therno Secret
                    Service, nobody. The president, who had tears in his eyes, looks at me, and
                    said, “Did I do okay?” I'm sitting there and I can barely talk, and I stammer
                    “Yes, just fine.” He then came over to mhe's about six two, six threa pretty big
                    guand gave me a great big bear hug; we sort of are supporting each other after
                    that. It had been obviously a very emotional day for him; his speech reflected
                    that much more than that written by his speech writers. In the speech he gave he
                    did not commit the United States to 'never again' on genocide, which was
                    something that nobody had argued for. What we had argued was that he go as close
                    to that as he possibly could; the formulation he used was something like, “While
                    we can never be certain that there will never another genocide; we must do all
                    in our power to prevent it, and be vigilant.” Of course, you got people like Tom
                    DeLay who would argue that this was the apology trip and that this was one of
                    the things that he would apologize for...</p>

                    off to brief the press. I had agreed that I would fly back on the press plane.
                    One of the guys that worked for me had never flown on Air Force One, so he and I
                    switched places. He flew back with the president on Air Force One; I flew back
                    on the press plane afterwards, and we spent a lot of time dealing with the press
                    on that.</p>
                <p>After that, we had a summit meeting in Entebe, Uganda. It's just right outside of
                    Kampala; it's where the airport is. We had invited the heads of government or of
                    state of East and Central Africa to a meeting to addresses conflict and post
                    conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in the context of Central Africa. It
                    was a good meeting. It was very, very useful; a number of ideas that were
                    proposed that were later incorporated in what came to be known as the “Great
                    Lakes Justice Initiative.” There was an Entebe declaration which laid out some
                    common goals and which tried to address the methodologies. Those pretty much
                    fell apart when Ethiopia and Eritrea went to war a couple of months later, but
                    there was value in the document and there was certainly value in the
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>In South Africa, the president clearly wanted to spend time with Mandela. The
                    president had enormous respect for Mandela, particularly the image of a man
                    spending 30 years in very difficult prison conditions and emerging espousing a
                    philosophy of reconciliation rather than going after his enemy. That is so
                    unusual in Africa. It's unusual anywhere, but it's particularly unusual in
                    Africa. Mandela is one of those rare personalities of historical importance who
                    is more than a president. He is a figure of considerable morality and high moral
                    purpose. We spent time in Capetown, then went up to Soweto and spent time in a
                    church in Soweto. The president then met with a number of civil society
                    activists. In addition to our overarching theme, we had a number of policy
                    objectives we wanted to accomplish within the African contexone of which was
                    embracing economic and political reforms. Secondly, he underscored the
                    importance of civil society in some of these countries. We talked about a civil
                    society in South Africa. Botswana gave us an opportunity to do two things. One
                    was to support the peaceful transition from one democratic president to another,
                    which we did. The other issue was the environment. That discussion took place
                    about the fifth or sixth day of the trip. There was a good chance for everybody
                    to take a little bit of a break when the president spent a day going to a game
                    park. He actually went up and spent the afternoon at a game park and liked it so
                    much that he went back the next morning. His game park trips, which were
                    scripted to be two hours, ended up being five hours. That particular game park
                    is the onI had insisted that he visit just because it was such a wonderful
                    example. It is up along the river between Botswana and Namibia; you can take a
                    boat down the river and you can see the game as they come to drink at the riveor
                    you can take a car to the riveThere are some great southern African savannah
                    water type experience. When the president wen to the park, then Jim Jamerson,
                    and I and a few others flew to Rwanda to meet with the president of Angola to
                    try again to move the peace process forward.</p>
                <p>Before we left for Botswana, I had awakened in the morning in Johannesburg and
                    was about to take a shower and shave. I looked in the mirror and I noticed that
                    one half of my face wasn't moving. When I winked at myself saying, “What a good
                    looking guy you are this morning,” as guys always do every morning, one side of
                    my face wasn't smiling back at me. I looked at it and it had pretty much
                    collapsed; it was frozen in place. I thought to myself, “My word, I've either
                    got a spider bite or else I've had a stroke.” I felt around for a spider bite
                    and couldn't find one. I thought this was strange. So I took a shower and got
                    ready and went to get on the airplane. I mentioned my finding to the president's
                    secretary. She said, “Yes, one side of your face is pretty much paralyzed.” So
                    we got the president's doctor and he said, “Let's call back to Walter Reed.
                    Hospital” So we were sitting on the airplane talking to Walter Reed, and they
                    determined that I had gotten Bell's palsy, which is an inflammation of one of
                    the three nerves. There are three nerves apparently that activate one side of
                    your face, and it was an inflammation of one of these nerves that caused my face
                    to freeze up. It's a classic case of not being able to drink soup because you
                    can't keep one side of your mouth closed.</p>

                <p>WILSON: That's exactly right, yes. I could not smoke cigars. To smoke a cigar I
                    had to kind of hold it in the other side of my mouth. I couldn't smile with both
                    sides of my mouth; I would drool. I flew to Angola and I got off the airplane
                    only to be met by the press because, after all, there was a presidential envoy
                    traveling directly from South Africa to Angola to meet with President Dos Santos
                    bearing a message from the president of the United States. I stood on the tarmac
                    with the Air Force general just behind me and the American ambassador next to
                    me, and I read to the Angolan people the message of peace from the president of
                    the United States of America. Then we went off and met with the prime minister,
                    the foreign minister, the president, and a bunch of other people, the UNITA
                    figures, and the Troikthe group of ambassadors from countries which were
                    responsible for supporting the peace process on behalf of the UN Security
                    Council, etc. We had lunch with Blondin Bay. I should say that the meeting was
                    great. We had everybody from their side and everybody from our side. We walked
                    into this meeting, and there was a translator there. I had never met Dos Santos
                    before, although he knew who I was and I obviously knew who he was. I knew a lot
                    of the people around there. We sit down in sort of a L shape with Dos Santos and
                    myself right at the corner with my delegation going one way and his delegation
                    going the other way, and with a translator sitting right behind us. He's a
                    Portuguese speaker. We started with a translator, but soon I said, “Look, how's
                    your French?” He said, “My French is pretty good.” I said, “We can either do
                    this one of two ways. We can either go through this translator, which is really
                    going to take a lot of time and who knows if it's going to be accurate or not,
                    or you and I can just talk in French.” He said, “Yes, let's just talk in
                    French.” So Dos Santos and I just talked in French. Half of my delegation didn't
                    speak French, half of his delegation didn't speak French, but it didn't make any
                    difference because he and I got along just fine; we conducted our business in
                    French. I told him, I said, “You know, I've been working on the Angolan civil
                    war not quite as long as you, but I've been doing it for a long time. I've been
                    doing it since the early 1980s. You take a look at my guys and you take a look
                    at your guys; there's something that's really striking in this, and it is that
                    all of you who have been involved in this war on the ground look so young and
                    refreshed, and you look at my delegation and they've all got gray hair, hearing
                    aids; they all look old and worn out. What does that tell you about the effect
                    of your war on you versus the effect of your war on us?” He loved that; he
                    thought that was great. We had Paul Hare with us, who was 64 but looks about 90;
                    he was the personification of somebody who's been ravaged by timhe also is my
                    weekend golfing partner to this day. So Dos Santos and I talked and we went
                    through everything. The focus of my message to him was the question of what was
                    going to happen after the war is over, in particular “What are you going to do,
                    because at the end of the day your most dangerous time is still ahead of you?
                    How are you going to deal with providing public services to your population when
                    you no longer have an enemy that you can point to as a reason for sacrifice and
                    inability to provide services? How are you going to be a respected member of the
                    international community at a time when such things as transparency and fighting
                    corruption and what not are going to be key elements of what you do? These are
                    the things that you need to focus on.” That's what we focused on for an hour and
                    a half, which is pretty good. That was a lot of fun. As we walked out and went
                    on our way, Paul Hare later told me that our ambassador to Angola, Don
                    Seinberwho was a very good friend, a person who is secure in his beliefs of how
                    good he is at doing what he doeas they were driving back in the car, had turned
                    to him and paid me the ultimate compliment by saying that I had done it almost
                    as well as he could have done it himself. Just as we got to the airport that
                    afternoon and getting ready to board the airplane, a journalist came up to ask,
                    “Can I have just one more radio interview?” I said, “Sure.” He and I go off to
                    the VIP lounge, and as we walked in, there was an Angolan television on the
                    wall. We walked in quite literally just as the national news broadcast was
                    beginning. The lead item on the national news broadcast was that a special envoy
                    of the president of the United States' special envoy had come to Angola to
                    deliver a message of peace. I looked up there, and there was I delivering the
                    message of peace looking very much like Edward G. Robinson in a Grade B gangster
                    movi“There will be peace, you dirty rat”because only one side of my mouth
                    worked. Everything else was frozen. Fortunately the Angolans hadn't spent a lot
                    of time watching Grade B American gangster movies, so they didn't make the
                    connection between my talking out of the side of my mouth and the typical
                    American gangster as portrayed in movies of the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
                <pb facs="0286" n="Page0286"/>
                <p>We got back on our airplane and flew back down to Botswana. The next day we did
                    another environmental activity which gave the president an opportunity to talk
                    about the environment in Africa and the fragility of the African environment and
                    to share with his audience and with the American press, his experiences in the
                    game park, not just seeing the game but what it had meant and the need to be
                    good stewards of the environment.</p>
                <p>Then we flew off to Senegal. We stopped at Senegal for a couple of reasons. One,
                    you really can't cover Africa without stopping somewhere in Francophone Africa.
                    Senegal was also, because of Gorey Island, an opportunity to underscore the
                    cultural and historic ties between Africa and the United States. Senegal in the
                    person of Diouf had long been a moderate, functioning democracy even though
                    Diouf's party had been power since independence. We did a couple of other
                    things. We went to see an AID projeca women in development project which was
                    about the empowerment of women, an important sub text, and then we went up to
                    review the troops in an exercise that European Command was doing with Senegalese
                    troops. That gave the president an opportunity to talk about the “African Crisis
                    Response Initiative,” which was something that Jim Jamerson and I had been
                    working on for a number of years from the military side and Susan Rice had been
                    working on from the diplomatic side. Then we went out to Gorey Island to see the
                    old slave house that has been turned into a museum and shrine to the Africans
                    who had gone through the door of no return to go off from their African
                    homelands to America as slaves. We were walking around the slave house; our
                    interpreter had wandered off with a couple congressmen to show them the slave
                    house. I was left with the President and Hillary and President Diouf of Senegal.
                    I was going to do the translating. Diouf turned to his wife, who was over in
                    another corner, and called her over, “Elizabeth,” and says to heI'm
                    translatin“Elizabeth, you know Ambassador Wilson, don't you?” Elizabeth says,
                    “Yes, of course.” Diouf then said, “You know, it's thanks to Ambassador Wilson
                    that the president of the United States has come to Africa, and in particular
                    it's thanks to him that President Clinton is here in Senegal with us.” I'm doing
                    the translating on this. When you get somebody as respected as President Diouf
                    to give you such compliment, I thought that it might be about time to retire. It
                    didn't get much better than this.</p>
                <pb facs="0287" n="Page0287"/>
                <p>I later went back to Senegal with the intention of suggesting to Diouf that he
                    not run again for president at the suggestion of a number of government people.
                    I went to see him and I sat down. The press was there, and he repeated in front
                    of the press what he had told me on Gorey Island. After the press left, he said,
                    “You know, what I told you on Gorey Island I really meant it, but I really want
                    everybody in Senegal and everybody in Africa to know it as well.” It was a
                    disastrous meeting, because after the president had said something like that to
                    you, how can you say something like, “Well, Mr. President, thank you very much.
                    Now it's time for you to leave.” Senegal was wonderful. The president gave a
                    great speech on Gorey Island in which he introduced all of the African Americans
                    who were on the trip with hipeople from Susan Rice to Betty, his secretary, to
                    his Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, to the secretary of Labor and a
                    number of other African Americans, members of the Black Caucus such as Charlie
                    Rangel. The point he was trying to make was that, no matter how humble your
                    originand no origin could be more humble than being a slave in a society 150
                    years agyou could still aspire to be a minister and a secretary and a senior
                    government official. Africans should be proud of what their fellow black people
                    have been able to accomplish in the United States since the end of the Civil
                    War. It was very well done. He obviously did it much better than I could ever
                    describe it. It was quite a moving speech. Then we were in Senegal. Monica
                    Lewinski, the scandal, invaded our little bubble again, because the Paula Jones
                    suit got thrown out, so there was apparently some celebrating. I was not present
                    at that, but there was apparently some celebrating that was seen by the press
                    stalking the president. The Senegal story for them was that the president had
                    been seen through lace curtains beating on bongo drums in celebration of the
                    Paula Jones case being thrown out. I think that that was a pure fabrication, but
                    that was what was reported.</p>
                <p>We got back to the U.S. 11 days later. We got back on April 2nd. We'd left on
                    March 19th or something like that. A couple things happened in the next couple
                    days. I went out to get married the next day, with my frozen face and all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been divorced when, or were you divorced?</hi>

                <p>WILSON: Sequentially. We're sequential Muslims. Yes, I'd been divorced. We got
                    married. We had already bought a house in the Palisades Foxhall neighborhood. It
                    was clear when we got into the house that on my salary I was not going to be
                    able to afford to live in the house. I could own it but I couldn't afford to
                    live in it unless I got a different job. I could retire, and so I did. I got
                    married, and the same day or the next day it became clear to me that I was the
                    most detested person in both the NSC and the White House domestic side, because
                    I had learned that the domestic side of the White House would never forgive me
                    for having taken 11 days of their president's precious timnever again would
                    Africa appear on his schedule.</p>

                    very good friend Don Bandler, who was my counterpart in charge of Europhad gone
                    in to brief the president and Hillary about a trip to Europe that the president
                    was going to make in June. White House procedures requires that you meet with
                    the president and Hillary in the initial planning stages so that you get some
                    feedback from them on what you are thinking, what they're thinking or what they
                    want to achieve, just to see if you're on the same wave length. Then you go and
                    develop the trip, and then you brief the president and all interested Cabinet
                    officials and senior officials in the Cabinet Room in a formal briefing. I did
                    these briefings differently from other people. I insisted in fact, that all the
                    Directors come with me to brief the president of the United States, which was
                    the first time that anything like that had been done. I'll go back to some of
                    that in just a minute. Bandler went for his initial briefing with the president
                    and Hillary; and he had barely sat down when the president said to him, “What I
                    want you to do is go talk to the Africa folks, find out how they did their trip,
                    and do the same thing. Then come back and talk to me.” Bandler wasn't real happy
                    with that because he had already done all his preliminary planning. We had done
                    some things in that trip that hadn't been tried before.</p>
                <pb facs="0289" n="Page0289"/>
                <p>The White House is a notoriously insular place, and the NSC especially. You work
                    for the president and you don't develop a domestic constituency. We turned that
                    on its head. We thought that, if there was one thing that Africa needed in this
                    town, it was a constituency. We also thought that this trip was of such historic
                    significance to people who were interested in Africa that they had a right to be
                    engaged in the planning. We also thought that, if we could get them engaged, we
                    could make them our allies and our advocates, and if we didn't engage them in a
                    meaningful way, they would just ultimately become our critics. For everything
                    that you do, there's half a dozen people telling you you're doing it wrong. The
                    first time I had briefed the broader African American community on what we were
                    planning on doing, the first question came from Sally Booker, who at that time
                    was on the Council of Foreign Relations. I said, “Yes, Sally, what would you
                    like? What is your question?” The answer was, “It's really more of a statement.
                    I just want your assurances that you're not going to go out there and embarrass
                    us.” I think that underscores the sort of level of mistrust or distrust or lack
                    of trust between people who are in the White House and people who are basically
                    paid to be critics of whatever the administration is doing. We did not embarrass
                    Sally Booker, I might say. But what we did is set up a series of what we called
                    “roundtables.” So as part of our planning process, we invited groups from
                    different constituencies to meet wit us. We talked with the PVO/NGO
                    communitprivate voluntary organization/non governmental organizatiowe met with
                    the business community, for example, and appointed team leaders and we assigned
                    them tasks. We invited them to spend three hours thinking about we should
                    accomplish in Africa. We tried to incorporate some of the best ideas that came
                    out of that in some of our subtexts, but very clearly in even doing we were
                    supporting our overall objective of portraying to America a view of Africa that
                    was different from what they were used to getting.</p>
                <pb facs="0290" n="Page0290"/>
                <p>We did select three or four different subjects, and had these “roundtables” on
                    them. We invited people to say whatever they wanted to and provide any sort of
                    advice. One of us from the NSC staff would participate in the whole
                    “roundtable,” and I was at every one to at least kick it off and I generally
                    would come and sit in for some of the dialog. That way we got an incredible buy
                    in to what we were doing. It worked very well, because after the trip when we
                    went around to various constituencies we were invited to all these receptions
                    where we were congratulated. Some people made money hosting receptions at which
                    we would go and speak about the president's trip. For one of my linewhich was
                    greatly appreciateI would stand on the podium, with 300 people in attendance,
                    and I would as“Did any of you see your ideas incorporated into the president's
                    trip?” And people would say, “Yes, we did.” I'd say, “Not every idea got
                    incorporated, but if you saw some of them, at least you know that we took into
                    consideration everything everybody suggested.” So we developed this little army
                    of people who were prepared to support us through thick or thin on Africa
                    policy. I think that helped us, as we went down the road, to get the “African
                    Growth and Opportunity Act” passed. Both sides of the aisle will tell you that
                    it is a piece of legislation that will stand the test of time. There was an
                    article just this morning in the Wall Street Journal about the effects of it on
                    increasing exports to the United States from Africa. We were criticized for all
                    show and no substance by the Republicans, who of course had no substantive
                    objections other than the fact that we were there and it cost money for us to be
                    there. But I think it was a huge accomplishment, because I think the trip really
                    did what we wanted it to do. It made Africa of a size and intensity that people
                    could really begin to understand. When they looked on their evening news
                    broadcast and they saw the president in Africa, the continent was suddenly not
                    so remote and not so dangerous, not so forbidding. All that, I think, was good
                    seeing the images of the president walking hand in hand with little kids in
                    Uganda or the president at the game parks or with civil society people talking
                    about things like attending church or like being part of an association or using
                    this school as a way of teaching this and thatolerance and things like that. So
                    I think it was all very good.</p>

                        operated, the role of Hillary Clinton with the president on a trip like

                <p>WILSON: She was very clearly a very close advisor to the president, and she made
                    her views known in ways that made it difficult for the president not to accept
                    her advice. She was pretty tough minded. In my case, she was also very
                    interested in Africa. She had already been to Africa on a trip. Her issues were
                    issues that we cared about a lowomen and children, families, things like that,
                    which are also core African issues. So she was extraordinarily effective. She
                    was also effective in articulating some of the difficulties of some of the
                    things that we were trying to accomplish, in forcing us to think more clearly
                    and focus our own minds more clearly on why we were trying to achieve. Going to
                    Rwanda was one of them, for example. She understood better than most the
                    potential political pitfalls of going to Rwanda. She understood, as we were
                    reviewing the speech, what the consequences were of trying to do something that
                    we perhaps could not act upon and how we needed to be very careful of the way we
                    phrased it; so she was a voice of considerable good judgment, and considerable
                    reason. I have enormous respect for her as a person and as somebody who is
                    committed to a set of ideas and principles.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very early on, but how did you see Madeleine
                        Albright at that point from the NSC perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Madeleine did not go on the trip with us. My first dealings with
                    Madeleine were all pretty positive. We met early on about Nigeria. It was
                    Pickering, Madeleine, myself, Susan and a couple of others. We had been some
                    conflicts between State and the NSC on Nigeria, and this was our first meeting
                    to try to figure out what to do. There were not a lot of good options. We could
                    eliminate some useless sanctions, but unless you were going to get the
                    international community to impose international sanctions on the oil sector in
                    Nigeria, you were not going to do anything that was going to hurt Sani Abacha
                    and his thugs. We understood that. There were those who said, “Well, we have to
                    do it because, as Jesse Jackson put it, we have to be on the moral side of
                    history,”that great moralist Jesse Jackson.</p>

                <pb facs="0292" n="Page0292"/>
                <p>WILSON: More than that, there were probably even more scandalous things that have
                    not yet come to light that he was doing, but that was his position anyway.
                    Madeleine's position when we first met with heshe said something that has stuck
                    with me ever sincwas “Look, the way I see it, we want to be part of the
                    solution, so we need to calibrate everything we do with that in mind. It seems
                    to me that we need to avoid, in our efforts to isolate Nigeria, isolating
                    ourselves from its future and from the solution.” That was, I thought, very
                    pragmatic and very thoughtful. Later on, we had two distinct camps. We had what
                    we called the “whackers,” those who would take a whack at Nigeria at every
                    opportunity no matter what, and then we had what we called the “appeasers,”
                    which included me, although I've never been known to be much of an appeaser. I
                    did believe that what we needed to do was we needed to figure out where we could
                    work with the Nigerian government on matters of mutual national security
                    concern, such as international criminal activities, narco trafficking, the
                    horrible conditions at their airport that caused it to be put on our list of
                    airports you should never travel to, and things like that. Then we should try to
                    build some rapport with the Nigerians that would allow us to more effectively
                    engage them on issues on their domestic political agenda. We won that debate,
                    but only because Sani Abacha died. We were clearly holding a weaker hand as we
                    went down the road. Then the untimely demise of Sani Abacha was timely, very
                    timely indeed, for a number of...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We put a bunch of people on the first plane to welcome in the new regime.
                    Madeleine was okay in the beginning. I must say, on other issues where we had to
                    engage the State Department, it struck us that there was not a lot of interest
                    in riding herd on the assistant secretary, who frankly needed some guidance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The problem was that she had a set of view on Africa that bore little
                    relation to reality of the situation. In Sudan, for example, the focus became
                    exclusively terrorism, even though the intelligence that we had obtained was
                    tainted and even though the Sudanese were making overtures on terrorist related
                    issues. We lost sight of the need to play an active role or the need to address
                    a civil war that had been going on for 25 years at a cost millions of lives.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: So the policy was skewed in ways that just could never be undone by that
                    administration. In Angola, after six years of the administration having
                    positively supportewe were one of the original Troika membera peace process and
                    understanding that the impediment to the peace process was increasingly Jonah
                    Savimbi, the UN and its representative and the Troika all agreed that we should
                    enhance the sanctions regime against Savimbi to bring more pressure to bear.
                    Susan decided, without saying why, without giving any reason, that she would
                    threaten to veto the resolution. That decision got communicated to New York
                    without any State Department or White House concurrence on the cable that went
                    out. That leaked to the Angolans in a way that reinforced their own paranoia
                    that the United States truly did have an insidious plan to make Jonah Savimbi
                    president of Angola. While we were never going to veto any resolution, just the
                    mere threat of it, even an unauthorized threat, set the peace process back a
                    year and a half. There were things like that.</p>
                <p>In working with the Europeans, we had fundamental differences on how we would
                    work with the French and the with the British on issues of common concern. I
                    always believed that we should work on those issues where we could cooperate and
                    where we could work together, and disagree where we could not agree; then we
                    would competed. Susan's belief was that we didn't work with those sons of
                    bitches at all unless absolutely forced to do it. The trouble with that approach
                    is the French are so ensconced in their zones in Africa that we couldn't
                    steamroller them; you just couldn't do it. Time and again they would outflank us
                    very easily and we wouldn't know what hit us, whether it was the Central African
                    Republic, the Congo, or West Africa countries. In 1994 after Rwanda, French
                    policy was pretty much on the ropes. In 1997, I guess, after Mobutu was
                    overthrown, it was clear that the French were going to have to reassess the
                    effectiveness of their African policy; they did that. We could have been very
                    helpful to the French on that. In fact, I went over to Paris and participated in
                    a significant debate with some 300 French scholars and academics and journalists
                    on Africa policy. It was called “Convergences and Divergences in U.S. and French
                    Approaches to Africa.” It was written up and published in book form. It always
                    seemed to me that we should be working to helping the French through this
                    debate, because the outcome of the debate was clear even before they went into
                    it. The outcome was going to be that Africa would be mainstreamed into French
                    foreign policy thinking. It would no longer have the policy priority that it had
                    in the past, nor would it be subject to the same political machinations that it
                    had been in the past. Historically French presidents used Africa as their
                    playground both literally and figuratively. Literally they'd gone there to hunt
                    and receive diamonds...</p>

                <p>WILSON: ...pick up a few diamonds, mess around with a few wives of dictators and
                    whatever. Figuratively they would launder money through African states back to
                    French contractors, who would then finance reelection campaigns. It's been a
                    rather interesting history. But going into this debate, it was pretty clear that
                    the outcome was going to be something that we could live with. Rather than work
                    with those who shared our views on this, we didn't work with anybody, and as a
                    consequence the Neanderthals were able to undermine some of the goals we were
                    trying to reach. I refer to people like Michel Depuche, who had been ambassador
                    to Cote d'Ivoire for 13 years, during which that time he had been the proconsul
                    and had run the French involvement in the civil war in Liberia from there; he
                    then had gone on to be Jacques Chirac's advisor on Africa and had reasserted
                    some primacy of place.</p>
                <p>We differed on the whole concept of a new generation of African leaderthis idea
                    that Melish of Ethiopia and Izais of Eritrea and Museveni of Uganda were all
                    really great people, the reincarnations of the messiah, and everybody else was
                    just a bunch of dictators. I think it was proven to be very simplistic and
                    frankly wrong headed. When the Ethiopian Eritrean war broke out, we had the
                    president call both Izais and Melish three times each to stop the air war. We
                    then had Susan go out with two instructions. One was to make this a temporary
                    trip designed to stand between two friends and neighbors at a moment of high
                    passion so that they wouldn't do something rash and stupid, and then to get out
                    of the way and turn it over to some broader organizational framework to help
                    them resolve their differences; and the second instruction was keep a very low
                    profile. We did not want to make their problem our problem. She went out there,
                    stayed 12 days and ended up getting involved in a process that took her two
                    years, and which required lots of compromises. You can go back and take a look
                    at the money that's flowed into the region as a consequence of this. When it was
                    clear that the Ethiopians and Eritreans were playing her, just as we told her
                    they would play her, she got huffy and had this big press conference and invited
                    the world's press attention on what she was trying to do and then flew off
                    uninvited to an OAU summit to brief them on what she was doing. It not an
                    approach that was taken seriously.</p>

                <p>WILSON: We got back in April and I started transitioning out. I basically said
                    that I wasn't going to stay on. I got offered a number of ambassadorships. I
                    said no; I'd been there, done that. We worked through the death of Sani Abacha
                    and then the outbreak of the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea and then left in
                    June and went off into glorious retirement.</p>

                <p>WILSON: I have a number of clients and we do a number of different things. We do
                    investments in projects in Africa and in the Middle East and in southern Europe.
                    We also do investments here in the United States for foreign investors who are
                    looking for and are interested in an investment portfolio here in the
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to raise one point, because I've been mulling
                        this over, and this goes back to the Gulf War. I've almost finished a series
                        of interviews I've been doing with our counsel general in Dhahran, Ken
                        Stammerman, and he was talking about a problem that he had, which was also
                        mentioned by Chas Freeman in Riyadh and by Bill Brown in Tel Aviv. A number,
                        not a large number, but a number, of people, and not just staff but
                        officers, couldn't take the pressure of the war, the threat of scuds,
                        biological warfare, the whole thing, and had to leave. To use military
                        terms, they chickened out. I served 18 months in Saigon during wartime, 1967
                        70. I listened to a lot of people, I've interviewed a great many of our
                        people who served in Vietnam, and you might say that the chickening out
                        incident just didn't occur. Maybe people didn't go there and were able to do
                        their chickening out before they went, but it didn't seem to happen. You may
                        have mentioned iI'm sure you havbut could you look at it again. Did you see
                        this as a new manifestation of the new Foreign Service or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0296" n="Page0296"/>
                <p>WILSON: There are lots of manifestation of the new Foreign Service that you see
                    going through your career, without a doubt. That, however, was one that probably
                    affected me far less than it might have in some of the other countries, for the
                    simply reason that, as soon as Iraq invaded Kuwait, we were instructed to draw
                    down to the minimum staffing level; so within 10 days we had drawn down to maybe
                    10 or 12 offices, something like that, and within a very short period of time
                    after that we had gone down to the bare minimum, which was five or six officers.
                    Most of our staff from the time we drew down until the time we finally left in
                    January were those people who had come from Kuwait and were not allowed to
                    leave; so they were forced to stay there. In our case we had the wife of one
                    officer, who was actually a part time temporary employee at the embassy, and
                    because of the position she occupied, I had acceded to her husband's wishes that
                    she remain in that position. She was a family liaison officer, temporary, but
                    she stayed. Then when she became pregnant, the circumstances changed and so we
                    moved her out. I had one other officer who came to me and said he couldn't take
                    it, he wanted to leave; so we made him redundant and sent him on his way. Our
                    rationale for doing that was that if you didn't want to be here, we didn't want
                    you here, because you're not going to be of any help. In his case, I'm surprised
                    that his career has gone on as long as it has. He seems to have done as well as
                    he has done, for some of those reasons that you pointed out. But I don't think
                    at the end of the day that, given the numbers of people that we were looking at,
                    the percentage of people who sort of chickened out was any higher than one would
                    expect in any other sort of situation, whether it's police officers in a gun
                    fight somewhere or any other sort of emergency situation that you don't expect
                    that you're ever going to have to meet. In the Foreign Service you expect
                    general hardships, but you don't necessarily expect that you're going to be
                    physically threatened. In our case, of course, we assumed really from the second
                    day, from our meetinI think I described the meeting to yothat some of us were
                    not going to survive; so it became incumbent upon management to make sure that
                    the staffing levels got to be as low as possible as quickly as possible, and we
                    did that.</p>
