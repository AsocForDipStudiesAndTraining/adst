                <p>Introduction by Ambassador Peck</p>
                <p>PECK: Ambassador Boyatt will be leading the second part of our presentation
                    today. Ambassador Boyatt was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. After receiving his BA
                    from Princeton University and MA from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy,
                    he served in the United States Air Force and reached the rank of First
                    Lieutenant. He entered the Foreign Service in 1959, and has served as vice
                    consul in Antofagasta, Chile from '60 to '62, assistant to the Under Secretary
                    of the Treasury until '64; second secretary at the American embassy in
                    Luxembourg until '66; and first secretary at the US embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus
                    from 1967 until 1970. He returned to Washington in 1970 as special assistant to
                    Joseph Sisco who was Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East; and he was
                    director of the Cyprus Bureau from 1971 to 1974, and named a member of the
                    Senior Seminar in foreign policy the following year. In 1975 Mr. Boyatt became
                    Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Santiago, Chile. Mr. Boyatt was chosen
                    to be ambassador to Upper Volta in 1978, and in 1980 he was nominated and
                    confirmed as the ambassador to Colombia. In 1983 Ambassador Boyatt was promoted
                    to the rank of Career Minister of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Boyatt has also received many awards in the course of his career. In
                    1969 he received the State Department meritorious honor award for courageous
                    behavior during the 1969 hijacking of the TWA plane by Palestinian guerrillas.
                    Later he received the William R. Rivkin award for intellectual courage,
                    disciplined dissent in taking bureaucratic and physical risks in the cause of
                    peace on Cyprus from '67 to 1970. In 1979 Ambassador Boyatt was given the
                    Christian A. Herter award for extraordinary contributions to the practice of
                    diplomacy. He has also been decorated by several foreign governments. In 1971
                    Mr. Boyatt was elected vice president of the American Foreign Service
                    Association, and he was elected president of AFSA in 1973 and served until he
                    was transferred to Santiago.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In 1984 Ambassador Boyatt was elected a member of the Board of Trustees of
                    Princeton University. He serves on the Advisory Boards and Advisory Councils of
                    several other institutions including the Woodrow Wilson School, and the Peru
                    Private Sector Management Project. In 1984 Mr. Boyatt was brought to the Sears
                    World Trade as vice president for Latin America by Frank Carlucci. And currently
                    Mr. Boyatt is a partner in the IRC group, and president of US Defense Systems.
                    Please join me in welcoming Mr. Boyatt.</p>
                <p>BOYATT: Thank you very much Ed for that introduction which would have amused my
                    father, and my mother would have believed.</p>
                <p>Just as an aside, how many of you know the book, and the author from which the
                    quote about “urine etching glass” comes from? All right, listen carefully.
                    Generation of Vipers by Philip Wiley. You're already one up on the cultural
                    affairs officer at any post where you serve.</p>
                <p>I've known Ed Peck for 25 years, and during those 25 years we probably spent 15
                    or 20 of them together...well, more like 15 in Washington. When we've been in
                    Washington together we see each other every day, and on every one of those days
                    Ed Peck has made me laugh. He is a truly humorous person, and you all have had
                    the benefit of that this morning. In addition to that, I've been playing poker
                    with him once a month during those 15 years as well. So he has made a
                    contribution of another sort to the well being of my family. And I want to take
                    this occasion to thank Ambassador Peck for his contributions to Tommy, and Kit,
                    and Jessica, Alexander, and Catherine, and to their educations. I mean, how can
                    you not love a guy who donates $100 a month to your cause?</p>
                <p>But having heard Ed you've heard the good cop, and the funny cop. And now you're
                    going to hear from the tough cop, with a story that is not funny at all. What I
                    want to do is to take you through, step by step, in real world, real time, a
                    Foreign Service case wherein in 1974, during the Cyprus crisis of that year, the
                    Foreign Service system about which Ambassador Peck was talking, efficiency
                    reports, and grievance systems, and the dissent channel, and hierarchies, and
                    the corridor reputation, and the network, where all of these elements of the
                    system were brought into play under tremendous pressure. Because the only time
                    you can really find out about a system is when it's under pressure. And it's
                    under pressure when the best interests of the United States are in play, when
                    the reputations of senior officers are at risk, and when you as a more junior
                    person, have a different view as to how the government should be proceeding,
                    than your bosses do. And that's when it really counts because everybody is
                    playing for keeps. And what I intend to do this morning is to give you a quick
                    history of Cyprus, to tell you where the various national and bureaucratic
                    players were in 1974, and then to step by step take you through a situation
                    which I lived, which demonstrates, I think graphically, all of these
                    elements.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>First, a capsule history of Cyprus. Cyprus is an island in the northeast corner
                    of the Mediterranean. It sits there like an aircraft carrier and dominates both
                    east, west, and north-south movement. Every empire from the Egyptians to the
                    British which has sought to dominate the Middle East has had to control Cyprus,
                    and they all have. The Egyptians did, the Mycenaean Greeks did, the Achaean
                    Greeks did, the Persians did, the Alexandrian Greeks did, the Romans did, the
                    Byzantines did, the Crusaders did, and the Ottoman Turks did, and eventually the
                    British did. Every one of those empires controlled Cyprus for anywhere from 80
                    years to several centuries. And every one of those empires left an impact on
                    Cyprus.</p>
                <p>In the ebb and flow of cultures across the island, two stuck. The first, and the
                    majority, is the Greek. The Mycenaean Greeks arrived in Cyprus in 1200 B.C., and
                    there has been a Greek presence there ever since. In modern times the Greek
                    portions of the island constituted about 80%, and that is an 80% majority which
                    speaks Greek, believes in the orthodox form of Christianity, and has essentially
                    a European culture. Unfortunately in the ebb and flow of history with all of its
                    mistakes, the Ottoman Turks, who controlled the island from 1570 until the
                    British came in 1870, for about 300 years, also left on the island a 20%
                    minority spread throughout the island in kind of a measles-like pattern in
                    enclaves, which was and is, Turkish, Muslim, and partaking of what is
                    essentially an eastern or middle eastern culture.</p>
                <p>The way Cyprus flowed into the interests of the United States, in the latter half
                    of this century, was through the decolonization of the island. When it began to
                    become clear that Great Britain was no longer going to be able to control the
                    island as they had from 1870 until the late 1950s, the two groups on the island
                    rose up in various ways in an effort to control what Cyprus was going to be
                    after the Brits left. The Greek Cypriot majority of 80% wanted enosis, which is
                    the Greek word for union. They wanted to unite Cyprus to the Greek motherland
                    just as other chunks of Greece had been united to Greece—Crete is an example,
                    Epiros is another example, Macedonia is another example. Historically what had
                    happened was that after those provinces would win their freedom from the Turks,
                    they would accede and become part of the Greek nation. And the Greeks on Cyprus
                    wanted the same thing to happen with the island.</p>
                <p>The Turkish minority, as you might understand, had absolutely no interest in
                    being a minority in a Greek nation including Cyprus. So as the Greek Cypriots
                    were fighting for union with Greece against the British in the '50s, the Turk
                    Cypriot minority began to fight and to agitate for “taksim”, or partition of the
                    island with part of it being Greek Cypriot, and part of it being Turk Cypriot,
                    and an exchange of populations to achieve that.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In '58 and '59 and '60 the British were in their typical decolonization situation
                    between two sides. They were being shot at by both sides. It was a mess. They
                    were trying to negotiate some kind of a constitutional modus vivendi, and in
                    1960 they were successful with the establishment of the London-Zurich Treaties
                    and Accords. And under London-Zurich what happened was that instead of Cyprus
                    becoming unified with Greece, or partitioned between Greece and Turkey, it was
                    declared an independent nation wherein there would be a Greek Cypriot majority
                    which would have the presidency and most of the cabinet posts, and a reserved
                    power-sharing majority in the parliament; but where the Turk Cypriots would have
                    the vice president, a certain number of cabinet posts, and total control over
                    the local affairs—land, water, family, religion, all of that sort of thing. Not
                    unlike the situation that was established in Beirut earlier. Great Britain
                    became the guarantor power, along with Mainland Greece, and Mainland Turkey, of
                    this constitutional regime.</p>
                <p>They stumbled along from '60 until 1963 in a very uncomfortable situation
                    characterized by feuding between the two communities. Eventually Archbishop
                    Makarios, who was elected president of Cyprus in a free election, and who was
                    also head of the Orthodox Christian church of Cyprus, tried to change the
                    constitutional regime to give more power to the central government, which the
                    Greek Cypriots controlled. The Turk Cypriots appealed to Turkey, the Greek
                    Cypriots appealed to Greece. Greece and Turkey both sent troops onto the island,
                    and a crisis ensued.</p>
                <p>The British were in that part of the world, as they were in other parts of the
                    world, trying to shift their imperial responsibilities to the United States.
                    Just as in Iraq, and the Gulf, and the Middle East, we found ourselves taking
                    over the great power, third power adjudicator, referee, enforcer role. We found
                    ourselves increasingly thrust into that role in Cyprus. Why? Because the United
                    States could not afford to have its Greek and Turkish allies at each other's
                    throats with armies, armed and trained by us, over Cyprus. So suddenly Cyprus
                    became a major problem for the United States wherein it had in the past, like
                    Palestine, and like Kashmir, and India-Pakistan, like Ireland, been a British
                    problem, it suddenly became an American problem.</p>
                <p>The differences were patched over in 1963. There was another crisis in 1967
                    wherein the parties almost came to war, but didn't. And Cyrus Vance,
                    incidentally, was President Johnson's negotiator in that crisis and managed to
                    avert a war, and indeed he managed to get a mechanism for negotiations
                    established which exists to this day. It must be the longest on-going
                    negotiation in the history of the world, still unsuccessful. In any case, the
                    situation on the island deteriorated, and deteriorated, and deteriorated, and
                    the position of the United States came more and more and more to the forefront,
                    and the British withdrew. And if they could have they would have washed their
                    hands of it. They had a treaty obligation. They couldn't get out of it, but they
                    very clearly weren't going to play a major role, and they very clearly
                    encouraged us to do so. And we, for our own reasons, we felt that imperative,
                    and we played that major mediatory role.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So, that's where we were in 1974. I hope you'll understand this capsulized
                    history. What it did was, it projected two warring ethnic groups, both of whom
                    were connected to metropoles which were our allies in NATO, and whom we could
                    not afford to see in conflict because of what it would do to the NATO alliance,
                    and because of the advantages it would give to the Soviets to fish in these
                    troubled waters.</p>
                <p>In 1974 the situation on the island was as follows: the Greek Cypriot community
                    was itself divided between those who supported independence, and those who were
                    disappointed with independence, and in fact wanted to go back to enosis. And
                    this latter group, more radical, the rejectionist front, went into clandestine
                    guerrilla warfare against its own government. And they began robbing banks, the
                    usual pattern. They began robbing banks to collect money, and they began using
                    the money to buy arms. They began raiding the stores of the Greek armies, and
                    the Cypriot armies to get arms, and publishing inflammatory leaflets, and
                    organizing, and doing the sort of guerrilla warfare things, both urban and
                    rural, that one always does when one is in charge of a rejectionist front.</p>
                <p>The government of Makarios remained in favor of a solution on the basis of
                    independence. The Turkish Cypriots continued to rearm because they saw trouble
                    coming, and because they increasingly heard the voices in favor of enosis. And
                    both Greece and Turkey, of course, supported their co-religionists on the
                    island.</p>
                <p>The situation in Greece was that Greece was run by a military junta, led
                    initially by a gentleman named Papadopoulos, a colonel, and eventually by
                    another gentleman named Ioannidis, who was a general. These Greek military men
                    in effect ran the country. They had a civilian face organization. They had a
                    prime minister, and a defense minister, and a foreign minister, all of whom were
                    appointed. But these people were puppets, and they didn't have any power, and
                    they did what the Greek army generals told them to do.</p>
                <p>In Turkey, in 1974, Bulent Ecevit, had been elected the prime minister, and was
                    the first prime minister from the left side of the political spectrum, and the
                    first democratic leader in the country in several years. The country had been
                    run by the army. His situation was fragile, and the Turkish army allowed him
                    varying parameters depending on what the issue was. On economic issues he had a
                    fairly wide borders within which he could operate. On nationalist issues, of
                    which Cyprus was the key, he had a very narrow parameter within which he could
                    operate.</p>
                <p>In 1974 the situation in Great Britain was that the discredited Wilson government
                    was on its last legs. “Sunny Jim” Callaghan was the foreign minister, he wanted
                    to succeed Wilson. He had absolutely no interest in the Cyprus problem. And he
                    had no interest in having to have responsibility for the Cyprus problem because
                    it would draw down his energy, and his resources, alienate the several hundred
                    thousand Greek Cypriots who lived, and still live, in London. And generally the
                    British were in a “wash my hands of it” mode.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>In the United States, if you'll remember, the first six months of 1974, we were
                    without a government. Nixon was in the final phase of Watergate, and it was
                    clear that he was without power, virtually without portfolio. But what power he
                    did have left, and what time he had left, was devoted to saving Nixon. So in
                    large measure one could say that the United States was without a government. And
                    into that vacuum stepped Henry the K. Henry Kissinger became, in effect,
                    president for foreign policy. Both during the final stages of Nixon, because
                    Nixon was without power, and during the Ford administration because Ford really
                    didn't have any capabilities in that area, Kissinger truly “ran” foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>But in any case, the point here is that the United States government was not
                    functioning in any way with any degree of efficiency. The normal channels of
                    government had become clogged. The concern with Watergate was overwhelming.
                    Washington was a very strange place in the first six months of 1974.</p>
                <p>From a bureaucratic perspective there were a couple of wild cards. The first wild
                    card was, that the defense establishment in the United States was very pro the
                    Greek military government. Why? Well, the main reason was because Admiral
                    Zumwalt wanted to home port the Sixth Fleet in Piraeus, the port of Athens, and
                    in order to home port the Sixth Fleet in Athens he had to have the agreement of
                    the Greek government. And since the Greek government was three or four generals
                    and colonels, he had to have their agreement. So nobody in the defense
                    establishment wanted to see any activity involving Greece which would alienate
                    the military government in any way.</p>
                <p>To complicate matters further, the CIA had a special relationship with General
                    Ioannidis and Colonel Papadopoulos. Why? Well, the reason is historical. In the
                    '40s and '50s when there was a communist guerrilla movement in Greece, and at
                    that time, at least in the late '40s, we weren't sure whether Greece was going
                    to go communist or not. We poured huge amounts of aid, and bureaucratic
                    attention, into Greece. And among that bureaucratic attention was a huge
                    intelligence establishment. And that intelligence establishment, as it always
                    does in a liaison way, got in touch with the Greek military, and the Greek CIA.
                    And it turns out that almost 30 years later, both General Ioannidis and Colonel
                    Papadopoulos had been very friendly with the CIA in the '40s and '50s, and the
                    CIA, in fact, had a very close relationship with both of them, particularly with
                    Ioannidis. So, from the CIA's bureaucratic point of view they had a major asset
                    in Athens. They had a relationship with the guy who ran the country, and they
                    didn't want it disturbed. And they certainly didn't want it disturbed by the
                    Cyprus problem.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of the US embassy in Ankara they had all sorts of things
                    that they were worried about in terms of the bilateral relationship, and they
                    didn't want to see Cyprus impinge upon those relationships because from the
                    Turkish point of view almost everything the United States did, or could do with
                    respect to Cyprus, was anathema to any Turkish government. And particularly this
                    Turkish government which was being observed very carefully by the Turkish
                    army.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>That was the world situation with respect to Cyprus into which one FSO-3—you
                    would say O-1 today, I think—stumbled as director of Cypriot affairs. I was
                    doing my job as the sort of super desk officer for the Cyprus problem,
                    monitoring the situation, when over a period of time in late '73 and early '74 I
                    began to receive increasing evidence that the government of Greece, the Greek
                    CIA, and the Greek military, were backing the radical rejectionist front on
                    Cyprus which wanted to overthrow Makarios and declare Cyprus part of Greece. Now
                    I knew, I'm a Greek language officer, I'd spent a lot of time out there, I knew
                    that were the Greeks, broadly defined, successful in establishing a government
                    in Nicosia which was responsive to Athens, much less which became part of
                    Greece, that Turkey would invade Cyprus. I knew that. And I knew that if Turkey
                    invaded Cyprus we'd have two NATO armies fighting each other, illegally, with
                    American supplied weapons and on the basis of American training, and that it
                    would damage our position in the eastern Mediterranean for a generation, and
                    provided—who knew at the time—what opportunities for the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The situation on the ground kept getting worse and worse and worse and the
                    signals, at least to me, were clearer and clearer and clearer that the bloody
                    Greek government was playing games with the pro-enosis extremists on the right
                    wing of the Greek Cypriot political spectrum. The goal appeared to be to get rid
                    of Makarios and install a government which would be totally responsive to
                    Athens.</p>
                <p>So what do you do? You're the initially responsible person. I took what I thought
                    was the most responsible action. I drafted an instructional cable to the
                    ambassador in Athens which said, in effect, go in to General Ioannidis, not to
                    the prime minister, not to the defense minister, not to the foreign minister, to
                    Ioannidis himself, and tell him in words of one syllable that even he will
                    understand, that the United States being the only government in the developed
                    world which is still on friendly terms with the government of Greece, that the
                    United States strongly opposes any efforts by any element of the Greek
                    government, overt or clandestine, to mess around in the Cyprus situation. And
                    that we particularly oppose any efforts to overthrow Makarios and install a
                    pro-Athens government. Because if that happens the Turks are going to invade,
                    and that's not good for any of us. And I also drafted backup supporting cables
                    for actions for our ambassador in Nicosia and our ambassador in Ankara to
                    take.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The cable got as far as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the bureau and he
                    called me in, and he said, “We can't do that.” And I said, “We have to do that.”
                    He said, “Nobody in this town wants to alienate the Greek government.” And I
                    said, “You would prefer a war?” Anyway, we argued back and forth, he refused to
                    clear the cable. So I went back and I redrafted it, and I toned it down but with
                    essentially the same message, and I came back with another try. This time he
                    said, “Okay.” So we went to the Assistant Secretary, and the Assistant Secretary
                    said, “We can't do that. Nobody in this town wants to hear this sort of thing.”
                    And I said, “We have to do it. As responsible people we just have to.” Well,
                    this battle went back and forth, and up and down, and finally along about
                    April—I had started this in February, so two months had passed—I finally got in
                    to see the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, who was Joe Sisco, my friend
                    and former boss in NEA had been promoted, and I said, “God damn it, Joe, we have
                    to do something.” And he said, “Look, this is very difficult. Nobody in
                    Washington wants to do this, particularly they don't want to hear anything
                    anti-Greek in the White House. Don't ask me why. I don't know why, but I know
                    that's how they feel over there.” So we had the same argument again.</p>
                <p>Eventually in about June I managed to get a much watered down version of my
                    instructional cable out of Washington with one version to our ambassador in
                    Athens, and backup cables in Ankara and Nicosia. The ambassador in Athens
                    instantly came back with a cable, which is his right, saying, “Those are
                    terrible instructions that you've given me. I can't possibly do that. If I do
                    that it's going to alienate the Greek government, and we won't have any
                    influence with the Greek government. I reject these instructions. You've got to
                    change them.” So I had to fight the fight all over again, but with one more
                    enemy. And by this time the CIA and the Defense Department had discovered what I
                    was up to and they were both opposed to doing this for the reasons that I stated
                    before. In the case of one, because of home porting; and the case of the other,
                    because they had a relationship with Ioannidis.</p>
                <p>So I went back for about the eighth time to the drawing board and finally got
                    another instructional cable out to the embassy in Athens. By this time it's July
                    5th. The ambassador in Athens promptly went on leave. And the DCM, instead of
                    himself carrying out the instruction, gave it to the Political Counselor. And
                    the Political Counselor, instead of going to General Ioannidis as instructed,
                    went to a Greek Orthodox bishop who was reported to have close relations with
                    the military, and gave the message of the United States government to this
                    religious figure. All of this was reported back to Washington about the 12th of
                    July. It became clear that the instructions had been carried out in a
                    halfhearted manner at best by the embassy in Athens.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>That same day we received a raw intelligence cable from the station in Athens
                    which said, in effect, “We have been in touch with General Ioannidis, and we
                    have been assured by General Ioannidis that the Greek government is not, and
                    will not be involved in any clandestine activity designed to overthrow
                    Archbishop Makarios, and to damage the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.”
                    That was a weekend, so all right, we'd had it from the horse's mouth. I went
                    home. And about 3:00 a.m. on Monday morning, I got a call from the Ops Center at
                    the State Department and the person said, “You better get in here. There's
                    fighting in Nicosia, and something is going on and it doesn't look good.”</p>
                <p>So I went into the State Department, I went up to the Operations Center, and they
                    said, “Here's what we've got.” And he put two pieces of paper in front of me. On
                    the left hand side was the Daily Intelligence Summary, which is done by the
                    entire intelligence community for the President and the Vice President, the
                    Secretary of State, and the highest officers. And it said, in its lead item, “We
                    have been assured by General Ioannidis that Greece will not move its forces on
                    Cyprus against Makarios. To the right was a cable from Embassy Nicosia
                    describing the fighting between Cypriots loyal to Makarios and Cypriots and
                    Greeks trying to overthrow him. The Presidential Palace was in flames the
                    Cypriot force has been decimated. We don't know where Archbishop Makarios is. We
                    presume he's dead. A government has been installed in Cyprus, and the new leader
                    is Nikos Sampson.” Nikos Sampson happened to be an individual who had killed a
                    lot of British policemen during the '50s, and he'd killed a lot of Turk Cypriots
                    during the '60s, and for them to make him the president of the new nation of
                    Cyprus, was just unbelievable, and unthinkable. And, of course, instantly the
                    Turkish army mobilized.</p>
                <p>Now think about this. There we were, sitting there with the entire intelligence
                    establishment of the United States in all of its majesty, having been conned by
                    a piss-ant Greek Brigadier General, on the one hand; and on the other hand the
                    disaster which I had been trying to avert, and avoid, coming true like your
                    worst nightmare. Well, it was in the fan, clearly. Several emergency meetings
                    were held, and Kissinger decided to send Joe Sisco out on a shuttle diplomacy
                    mission to solve the problem. And I had been around Washington long enough, and
                    had become cynical enough, that I knew that the minute Kissinger sent Sisco,
                    instead of going himself, it meant that he knew that there was no hope, and he
                    didn't want to have a loser identified with himself. So he sacrificed Under
                    Secretary Sisco, and his staff, of which I was one. I mean it's a clear
                    bureaucratic signal that you're not going to win. And we didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>We flew first to Athens where an ashen-faced ambassador received us and said,
                    “We've made arrangements for you to see the foreign minister.” And Sisco said,
                    “I'm not going to see the foreign minister. If I can't see General Ioannidis,
                    I'm leaving.” And we had about a morning's go-around over that, but we
                    eventually got to see General Ioannidis, and Joe Sisco went in there and said,
                    “If you don't do something we're going to have a war, and you're going to lose
                    the war. Now give me some elements of compromise that I can take to Ankara that
                    we can work with.” Whereupon, General Ioannidis launched into an emotional,
                    weird, surreal, description of Byzantine history, and the struggle against the
                    Osmanli Turks, and Constantinople, not Istanbul. We were clearly in real trouble
                    because this guy had disconnected from the world, and he had all the power. And
                    he didn't give us anything.</p>
                <p>We went off to Ankara, and we met with Ecevit. We met with Ecevit just forever it
                    seemed like, eight or ten hours. Talk, talk, talk, and Ecevit was just shaking
                    his head, no, no, no. I'm not going to do anything. And finally our ambassador
                    there, Butts Macomber, who is known to Ed, and Steve, and myself at least, and
                    someone who had been Under Secretary for Management, with whom I had fought
                    seriously as president of AFSA, but for whom I had a great deal of affection and
                    respect, he sort of went like this, time out. And everybody stopped talking, and
                    he turned to Ecevit, and said, “Mr. Prime Minister, you're a teacher and a poet.
                    You're not a military man, and there are kids all over the world who are not
                    going to forgive you if you let this happen.” A tear rolled down Ecevit's cheek,
                    and he said, “Mr. Ambassador, it's out of my hands.”</p>
                <p>The next morning the Turks hit the beach. They attacked northern Cyprus, they
                    overwhelmed the Greek Cypriot forces in Kyrenia. They drove straight through to
                    the Turkish sector of Nicosia and established a bridgehead on the island. We
                    went back to Washington with a failed mission, and at that point I was, as you
                    can imagine, self-righteous, and angry, and disappointed because American
                    diplomacy had conducted itself in such a way as to bring damage, death, and
                    destruction. The three Ds. It was, in my mind, unforgivable.</p>
                <p>So, I wrote a dissent memorandum. And in that dissent memorandum I covered what I
                    had tried to do, where I had been blocked, what the intelligence community had
                    said and done, what the Defense Department had said and done, what had had
                    happened. And, yes, I had to say, “you see, I was right,” you know, a little bit
                    of that. But then I said, “But Mr. Secretary,”...these dissent memoranda go
                    straight to the Secretary...”Mr. Secretary, you have to go to the Turks now, and
                    keep them inside that bridgehead because if they break, and drive to both
                    coasts, they will divide Cyprus in half, and Greece and Turkey will have another
                    boundary over which they can fight until the end of time. And what's more, you
                    will have them fighting with American supplied equipment which is contrary to
                    their treaties with us, and our military supply relationships with both
                    countries will have to be stopped...blah, blah, blah.”</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Clearly, Kissinger...I'm not sure he ever saw my memorandum. There's a
                    requirement that they be answered within 30 days. In fact, my memorandum was not
                    answered by Policy Planning for six months, and I'll get to that in a
                    minute.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, on the island itself the Turkish tanks, two days later, drove out of
                    the bridgehead, crashed across the island east and west in both directions, cut
                    Cyprus in half, great slaughter of Greek Cypriots in the Turkish area, great
                    slaughter of Turk Cypriots in the Greek area. A bloody mess. The government of
                    the generals in Athens fell, and a democratic government took over but it was
                    totally paralyzed. The only good thing was, it was clear that that democratic
                    government was not going to get into a war with Turkey.</p>
                <p>In Turkey, the Turkish army simply did whatever it decided to do and Bulent
                    Ecevit had the choice of ratifying it, or disappearing, and he chose, however
                    reluctantly, to ratify it.</p>
                <p>On the island of Cyprus itself, everyone blamed the United States for what had
                    happened. There was rioting, and there was a lot of shooting around the American
                    embassy. And one particular morning the shooting was particularly bad, and as
                    everybody ran for the safe room—a room with steel casings around it—one of our
                    colleagues (long pause) was hit in the head, and her head was blown off. A
                    Foreign Service national, and as the ambassador reached out to carry her, he
                    took one right here, which tore his heart out, (pause) and he was dead before he
                    hit the ground. A friend of mine, and Ed's and Steve's.</p>
                <p>So, there you have it. We had alienated all three parties, the Greeks, and the
                    Turks, and the Cypriots. We had caused severe death and destruction on the
                    island. We had contributed to the death of friends, and in general made a mess
                    of it. As you can see, it is difficult for me to this day. In any case, I got
                    what I deserved. That is to say, I was simply fired. Kissinger said, “You are
                    relieved of your job as director of Cypriot affairs.” And I expected that. So I
                    just went home, and stayed there.</p>
                <p>The situation on the island went from bad to worse. Indeed, our relationships
                    with Turkey and Greece were severely damaged. They stayed damaged for a
                    generation, and we had a lot of problems in achieving our policy goals in that
                    part of the world.</p>
                <p>Well, what are the lessons of all this? What does it tell you? In order to make
                    that clear I have to provide a postscript. And the postscript is what happened
                    to me. Well, what happened to me was that, unbelievably for me, the Director
                    General of the era called me up, and said, “I'd like you to go to the Senior
                    Seminar.” I said, “Hey, you can't be serious. I'm damaged goods.” And he said,
                    “No, no. We want you to do that.” And, of course, I did. It's an honor
                    assignment, it's fun. It's a great year. It's the senior most training
                    assignment that one can have, and I have to tell you that I was surprised, as
                    well as delighted. That's what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Half way through that year, I got a call from the intelligence committees on the
                    Hill, the Church committee on the Senate side, and the Pike committee on the
                    House side—it was the Pike committee that called me—and they said, “Mr. Boyatt,
                    we have decided in analyzing US policy failures, we're going to do the three Cs,
                    Chile, Cambodia, and Cyprus. And you had a lot to do with Cyprus, and we'd like
                    you to testify.” And I said, “You can't come to me directly, you have to go
                    through the chain of command. If you want me to testify I'll have to call my
                    superiors, and ask them.” And they said, “That's fine. Do that.” And mind you,
                    I'm in a training assignment, all right? So I called Larry Eagleburger, who was
                    the Under Secretary for Management, and who was very close to Henry, and I said,
                    “Larry, the Pike committee wants me to testify.” And he said, “You can't.” I
                    said, “Okay, I'll tell them that you said that.” So he said, “Wait a minute.”
                    (Laughter) “Let me talk to the lawyer.” So he went and talked to the lawyer, and
                    called me back and he said, “You can't on the basis of executive privilege.” I
                    said, “Okay.” I called up the Pike committee, and I said, “I can't testify.
                    Under Secretary Eagleburger has said I can't testify on the basis of executive
                    privilege.” And the counsel for the committee said, “That's nonsense. Executive
                    privilege flows from the President only to his immediate advisers, and not down
                    to desk officers at the State Department. I'll call Eagleburger.” So a big
                    struggle ensued—with constitutional overtones, by the way. A fight between the
                    Executive Branch, and the Legislative Branches, as to whether I could testify or
                    not. And finally Kissinger said, “Okay. You can testify, but you can't say
                    anything that's classified.” So I saluted, and I went up to the hearing.</p>
                <p>There were three or four Assistant Secretaries in the room, and Pike didn't call
                    any of them. Instead he called me. So I went up, and was sworn, and he asked me
                    a question. The first question he asked me involved a classified response, and I
                    said, “Mr. Chairman, my instructions from the Secretary of State are that I can
                    come, I can testify, but I can't divulge any classified information.” “What!”
                    And he went ballistic, and he cleared the room of all of the “riff raff”
                    Assistant Secretaries, and the press, and everybody else, and the CIA's lawyer.
                    And I'm sitting there all by myself, and they're all up there on this
                    pedestal—you know how they intimidate you—and he went into executive session and
                    he said, “Now you can testify.” And I said, “Those aren't my...” Anyway, it went
                    back and forth, and back and forth, and halfway through they discovered that
                    there was a Boyatt dissent memorandum, about which I had heard nothing from the
                    Foreign Service specifically. And they subpoenaed the dissent memorandum, and
                    Henry, of course, resisted that mightily. This struggle went on and on, and
                    eventually an agreement was reached under the terms of which I was allowed to
                    testify in closed session, and answer questions up to secret but not beyond
                    secret. And the Boyatt memorandum was cut into pieces, and those pieces were
                    interspersed with other drivel made up by S/P designed to disguise what was the
                    Boyatt memorandum because Dr. Kissinger was so concerned for protecting my
                    anonymity. (Laughter) If you believe that, you will also believe anything.</p>
                <p>Anyway, a constitutional compromise was reached. At the end of my year in the
                    Senior Seminar I became the Deputy Chief of Mission in Santiago which is a great
                    job. It's a career making job. I wound up being charg� there, and went on to two
                    embassies, and retired when I was 50, and lived happily ever after.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>What are the lessons? Well, there are a lot of lessons here. The first lesson is
                    that you really test the system by how it performs under pressure. That's lesson
                    number one. In my case, the system performed pretty well under pressure. While
                    it is true that in a policy sense I was unsuccessful...maybe that's a fair way
                    of putting it. I was unsuccessful in getting the United States government to do
                    what it should have done, when it should have done it. And if I'd been
                    successful, lives would have been saved and the best interest of this nation
                    would have been much better served. But in the process of trying to do that, I
                    spit in just about everybody's eye that you can spit into. I fought with the CIA
                    at the highest levels, I fought with the Defense Department at the highest
                    levels, I fought with two ambassadors at the highest levels, and I fought with
                    everyone that was above me in the bureaucratic chain of command—the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, and the Under Secretary, and there
                    was an implied fight the whole time with Kissinger. And he knew it, and I knew
                    it. And yet, I survived. And not only did I survive, I prospered.</p>
                <p>Why? How? What were the mechanisms that made this possible? Well, I guess three.
                    One is the dissent channel. I used it, and I used it in the proper way. I used
                    it in the appropriate way. Two, I fought but I kept my fight within the
                    building. At any point in this struggle, I could have gone to the press, or the
                    “Hill”, (the Congress) and I could have generated a counter-fire against Henry
                    Kissinger and made him fight out our Cyprus policy in public. In which case he
                    would have had...the case for what I wanted to do was so overwhelming, that had
                    it gotten into the public domain, particularly the press domain, and the
                    Congressional domain, that he would have been forced to do what I wanted him to
                    do, but I did not do that. Now, I stayed within the system and a friend of mine
                    was killed. But I did stay within the system. What did the system do for me?</p>
                <p>Much to my surprise the first thing that happened was that I got a great
                    efficiency report from the very Assistant Secretary I had been fighting. The
                    Director General stepped in, and made sure that I got to the Senior Seminar.
                    Somebody else stepped in and made sure I got a good onward assignment. In short,
                    the old boy network, and it's still an old boy network, by the time you guys get
                    up there it will be an old boy and old girl network, but in those days it was an
                    old boy network, closed ranks, and everybody in that system did what they could
                    to take care of me, and they did. And I lived to talk about it.</p>
                <p>The questions? There are a lot of them, and the biggest one, of course, is did I
                    do the right thing. Well, I don't know. Judgement is everything. Believe me, I
                    would not have fought this fight over something that was unimportant. I wouldn't
                    have fought this fight over an efficiency report, and I wouldn't have fought it
                    over a travel allowance. But from my perspective the best interests of the
                    United States were in play. So I fought. When your time comes, I hope you
                    fight.</p>
