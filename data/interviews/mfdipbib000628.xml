                <p>Interviewed by: Kirstin Hamblin </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Ambassador Ridgway B. Knight on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. Today is October 23, 1993,
                        and I am Kirstin Hamblin. Ambassador Knight, I'd like to begin with a little
                        bit about your background, such as where you were born, where you were
                        educated, and the types of subjects that you studied in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I was born in Paris, of American parents. I went back to New York
                    City very young, went to school in New York until I was about nine years old,
                    came back to France where my father liked to paint. He was a well-known
                    landscape painter as well as was my grandfather Ridgway Knight. So I went to
                    secondary school here, and I obtained my two baccalaureates in Paris, then I
                    went back to the Harvard Business School from where I graduated in 1931.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What chain of events led you to join the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It's a very, very long story because I was always interested in foreign
                    affairs but when I came out of business school, I felt that I didn't have the
                    financial resources to lead an interesting, and successful Foreign Service life.
                    Because in those days the Foreign Service was not what it is today. In fact, you
                    could not get along on your salary. One had none of the allowances and special
                    facilities such as help for educating one's children, housing allowances,
                    commissaries, etc... So I decided to go into business and make some money. With
                    great luck I was able to do so and thus to constitute a small nest egg which, in
                    due course, did a great deal to make my Foreign Service career more pleasant. In
                    partnership with a friend we bought out an old family firm of wine merchants
                    after the repeal of Prohibition, Bellows and Company, which went back to 1830.
                    Several years later we had made it into one of the foremost importing firms of
                    wines and spirits in America. However, my partner, Frederick S. Wildman and I
                    were deeply interested in the European situation and both of us believed that
                    France and England's war against Nazi Germany was our war as well. Having
                    decided to participate in the war effort, we sold our firm to National
                    Distillers.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Looking back on what I did, it may sound a little crazy to-day. I was married and
                    the father of three fine small boys. However, and fortunately, my wife's
                    financial situation was adequate and I felt a compelling duty to do what I could
                    personally.</p>
                <p>Reasoning that the first branch of the service to be engaged would be the Air
                    Force, I learned how to fly and presented myself at the Air Force's downtown
                    recruiting office in New York...only to be laughed at! Indeed, it turned out
                    that I was quite color-blind, something which I had never suspected. Thinking
                    that the next outfit to see active duty would be the Marines, I went to
                    Governor's Island where I was turned down for the same reason, plus a trick knee
                    dating back to schoolboy athletics. However, the Marine officer who had
                    interviewed me was kind enough to add that he liked my spirit and that he might
                    be able to get me a commission for limited duty, such as recruiting. Clearly,
                    that was not the kind of involvement I was after.</p>
                <p>Somehow my two applications, plus one to the Navy Department, found their way to
                    the State Department, which was working on an intelligence mission to French
                    North Africa, together with the War and Navy Departments. Much has been written
                    about this operation, commonly referred to as the “Murphy Mission”. In a few
                    words, President Roosevelt, with his global view of world affairs, had realized
                    as soon as the WWII had started, that French North Africa provided an excellent
                    launching platform for a possible attack against Southern Europe. He had
                    inquired what intelligence we had on the area and it turned out that we did not
                    even have the telephone books of the major cities! So, very much under F.D.R.'s
                    personal direction, Robert D. Murphy, then Counselor of Embassy in Vichy, had
                    negotiated an agreement in Algiers with General Maxime Weygand, the Vichy
                    Government's “pro-consul” for all of French North Africa. On the one hand, the
                    United States would provide certain civilian goods, essential for keeping the
                    native populations quiet; such as sugar, green tea, powdered coffee, flour and
                    cotton cloth - to clothe the living and bury the dead - and a very small
                    quantity of POL products. On the other hand, the French would accept 12
                    “Vice-Consuls and Technical Advisers” to supervise the handling of these
                    products to make certain that they would not find their way across the
                    Mediterranean, where they might fall into German hands. Of course, this was a
                    cover for our real mission, i.e. the gathering of intelligence.</p>
                <p>Well, as time passed, and once we had come into the war, our intelligence work
                    turned into the preparation of a possible landing. We worked very actively with
                    local elements who were opposed to the Germans. And I think that our efforts
                    resulted in minimal resistance when finally the Americans, and British in
                    American uniforms, landed on November 8th, 1942.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>You asked me how I came into the Foreign Service, that wasn't the reason.
                    Actually, after the North African landings I went into the Army, and after
                    landing in Italy at Salerno, seeing duty on the Anzio beachhead and working as
                    liaison officer between General Clark commanding the Fifth Army, and General
                    Juin commanding the French Expositionary Corps, I was, as a favor, assigned to
                    an outfit which was to land in southern France on August 15, 1944. Strange as it
                    may seem, that is how I came into the Foreign Service! As we made our way up
                    through southern France, politically interested as I was, I wrote a memorandum
                    on political conditions as I observed them. By a miracle of efficiency, which
                    I'm sure has not been often repeated, my memo was amongst the papers given to
                    Ambassador Caffery when he took his plane in October of 1944 to join his post in
                    Paris. My paper happened to be the only paper written on conditions south of the
                    Loire, and he said, “I want that Major on my staff.” And that is how I came into
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you were then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Then I became a special assistant to the Ambassador, and also of his
                    successor Ambassador David Bruce until I went back to Washington in January of
                    '50. Finally, in 1946, I was integrated into the Foreign Service as a Class 4
                    officer under the Manpower Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what specifically did you do as special assistant to
                        both of these ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I had two titles, I was special assistant to the Ambassador, and I was a
                    full-fledged member of the Political Section. I was responsible for dealing with
                    several of the French political parties, and I reported on the French
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of involvement did you have in post World War II
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I was one of the two American Commissioners handling the rectification of
                    the Franco-Italian border. The other one was Freddie Reinhardt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can go on to the next question. After Paris, you went
                        back to Washington and you were the Deputy Director of European Regional
                        Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, I was Deputy Director for European Regional Affairs which handled
                    NATO, the budding European movement, in other words what we would today call
                    multinational diplomacy. After two years, I was for one year Deputy Director of
                    Western European Affairs, and then for a second year, Director of Western
                    European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What exactly did you do in this job? I mean as far as
                        running the office...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I don't understand the question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Director of the program, I mean you managed the
                        office and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, as a desk officer...you handle the entire relationship with the
                    countries you are responsible for. It's so broad that it's a little difficult to
                    answer. I would say that we follow carefully the developments, political and
                    economic, I would say all kinds, consular as well as anything else in the area
                    of your responsibility. I'm talking about Western Europe, this was my field. You
                    also formulate recommendations as to what should be our policy toward these
                    areas. You also give instructions to embassies as to how they should conduct
                    themselves on this, or on that. It's so very broad, it's the whole life of the
                    country that you're dealing with of an area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What major events did you have to deal with during that
                        time being director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Again, it's so extraordinarily broad. From the point of view of the first
                    job, European Regional Affairs, I would say that...it was also
                    political-military, not just regional, but political-military. As a matter of
                    fact, it's amusing to think that that area which was condensed in one office
                    then, is now handled by a couple of Assistant Secretaries of State. I would say
                    the main development that claimed my attention, was the development of NATO
                    which was still a very fledgling and new organization. And another problem which
                    took up a good deal of time, was French Indochina, and the French war in
                    Indochina, which is all but forgotten. At that time we helped the French as much
                    as we could with arms, and economic assistance.</p>
                <p>If I refer to the two following 1952 and 1953 years, I would say that NATO
                    continued to be very important because most of my client states were members of
                    NATO. And also Indochina wasn't finished, so I would say that continued. Another
                    broad area which took up a good deal of time was the budding European movement.
                    Even though I was rather junior in those days, I did participate in a number of
                    conversations and discussions as to where our interest lay. Was it to our
                    advantage to have a united Europe, which would be a powerful political body
                    which could help us militarily, vis-a-vis the Soviet threat, and more generally
                    share a part of our worldwide burden? Or should commercial disadvantages take
                    precedence? Because we were sure that a united Europe would be a much more
                    dangerous competitor for the United States. At that time it was decided that the
                    political advantages, and the military advantages of having a strong Europe
                    which would help us assume our world responsibilities, and contain the Soviet
                    Union should take precedence. I can only observe somewhat wryly that our
                    optimism at the moment was, I'm afraid a little bit exaggerated. Indeed, while
                    the economic threat has developed, we have not yet derived any of the political
                    and military benefits which we had hoped for.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time how did you deal with the threat of
                        communism? I mean in what specific ways were you working against that in
                        western Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, that's a matter of public knowledge. It was building up the NATO
                    forces which would be powerful enough to contain a Soviet attack, and therefore
                    to deter it. I'm glad to say that it worked out. We did deter aggression. We
                    also fostered the economic rebirth of Western Europe which was just as important
                    in dealing with the Soviet threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this in 1955, you became the political adviser
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: We're jumping from '54 to '65?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. This was 1955—Deputy Assistant High Commissioner
                        for Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, responsibility for Berlin. Mr. Dulles had the idea that it would
                    encourage the Berliners to think that we were returning to normalcy should the
                    number one American in Berlin be a civilian, instead of the General commanding
                    the garrison. Well, it took me about three weeks after arriving in Berlin to
                    discover that the only real concern of the Berliners was the Russian threat.
                    They were only interested in the protection of our armed forces, and Mr. Dulles'
                    brilliant idea was a non-starter. Hence I recommended that the position be
                    abolished, that we revert to the preceding situation, i.e. the American General,
                    being the number one American in Berlin. This took about a year. Anyhow, the
                    position was also to disappear with the end of the occupation status. That time
                    coincided with the entrance of Germany into NATO in 1955. General Gruenther, who
                    was Supreme Allied Commander Europe, asked for me as his political advisor, in
                    part because I had worked for him in Italy during the war. So I was lucky enough
                    to be named to that position. I was Political Advisor to General Gruenther for a
                    year and a half, and to his successor, General Norstad, for another year and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>Then at that time I was sent to Pakistan as number two, as Minister Counselor,
                    which was my only unhappy job in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well because I happened to disagree with U.S. policy. I happened to feel
                    that the Pakistanis were taking us to the cleaners. The entire aid which we were
                    giving them was being used for developing NATO type, military formations—which
                    could only be used against India, which was not an enemy of the United States.
                    The Pakistani war effort was not going into developing mountain brigades, the
                    type of units which could be used against the Soviet Union, which was our
                    concern. But when I made these views known to the Secretary of Defense visiting
                    Pakistan, they were not particularly welcomed.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of my tour in Pakistan which made it my only unhappy experience in
                    the Foreign Service, is that I had to deal with extensive black marketing going
                    on in the U.S. Mission to Pakistan, and in which the military were very
                    prominent. And it had to be stopped and I was told so in the Department when
                    leaving Washington. The military were cashing in the local rupees into dollars
                    at the official rate, including the Commanding General of the outfit, General
                    Truman. When I refused continuing to do so I became persona non grata from the
                    Pentagon. That nearly ended my career. Fortunately, luck was on my side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I was named to a non-job at the White House, Deputy Director of the
                    Operations Coordinating Board. It was an outfit created under President
                    Eisenhower. The idea was to take the decisions of the National Security Council,
                    and translate these into detailed directives which would govern the operations
                    of the various governmental Departments in Washington. On paper it's fine, but
                    no Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of the Treasury, is going to be governed
                    by a piece of paper coming out of such a junior body. At least it gave me a
                    perch, shall I say, of something that looks not too bad on your curriculum
                    vitae.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after that you were sent to Syria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That was where luck came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, at that time Syria was an explosive place. It seemed to be not a
                    particularly good assignment. It was part of the United Arab Republic, and not
                    many people wanted it. When I was asked if I wanted to go to Damascus, I said,
                    “With pleasure.” And eight months later Syria broke away. As a matter of fact,
                    if I accepted with such alacrity, it was because I believed that the United Arab
                    Republic was not going to last very long. I had no other insight except my own
                    opinion. So don't ask me how I knew. So I went in October of '60, and in
                    September of '61 Syria broke away, and I was fortunate enough to be named
                    Ambassador.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a hard time dealing and negotiating for the
                        United States with Syria at that time because they had such a turbulent
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I don't know that it was a hard time, but I had a successful time.
                    Because after my five years in Syria...I forget the name of the award, but it's
                    the State Department's top award, Assistant Secretary Talbot made the comment
                    that at no time during my years in Syria had I needed any instructions from the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have one more question about that. Did our relationship
                        with Israel affect our relationship with Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: What's that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the United States' relation with Israel...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Of course. That's the heart of the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was what made it difficult? After Syria...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's the heart of the problem. You know perfectly well that the
                    creation of Israel, and our relationship with Israel, has been...it isn't the
                    only one, but it's been at the heart of an explosive situation in the Middle
                    East ever since. I survived only because I'm the first one to know that the
                    Arabs are so intensely individualistic that even without Israel you can be
                    pretty sure that we have some kind of turmoil in the Arab world. Of course, the
                    interesting thing about the assignment to Syria, and to any Arab country, is the
                    challenge, it's the difficulty of the problem. Because on the one side you have
                    a depth of feeling on the part of the Arabs which is very difficult to
                    appreciate for one who has not lived there. It's cockeyed, it's unjustified, but
                    it's there. And this is one of the reasons why I never felt that the
                    Arab-Israeli problem can be solved by a single piece of paper, by a nice neat
                    plan. The Arab-Israeli problem can only be solved by time, step by step, little
                    by little, preventing explosions, and I think that with time this is what's
                    happening now. Arafat's position, and the recent initiative leading to the
                    Gaza-Jericho suggestion is not going to solve the whole problem. It's the result
                    of the fact that when we made the proposal, Arafat had no other place else to
                    go, he'd used all his other cards, all his other weapons. He had to try this
                    peace line. It's a great step forward, and I welcome it, but it is only a step
                    toward better relations. But once again I repeat, I don't think the Arab-Israeli
                    problem is going to be solved by any single plan, or one piece of paper. It's
                    still going to take a lot of time to work out.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Syria, you went to Belgium. This was in 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. Belgium was very peaceful after Damascus. I forgot to say that
                    during my stay in Damascus, I went through four revolutions, and if I count all
                    the changes in governments, in those five years, I had dealt with sixteen
                    different governments. So, as I say, Belgium was very peaceful. But I did have
                    two major problems to deal with during my four years in Brussels. One was the
                    expulsion of NATO from France by General de Gaulle, and helping convince the
                    Belgians to accept NATO as an institution in their country. The Belgians were
                    very happy to welcome the civilian institutions of NATO. But the Belgians are
                    internationally timid, being such a small country. Even though they're no longer
                    neutral, the spirit of neutrality is still in the country up to a point. They
                    feel that to live happily, if you live a little hidden and out of the limelight,
                    it's much better. Therefore they were most reluctant to accept the military
                    headquarters. And it required a certain amount of cajoling to induce them to do
                    so, but it was done in a friendly spirit. At a farewell official dinner when I
                    left Belgium, Foreign Minister Harwell stressed that at no time had I sought to
                    twist their arm, or to use the might of United States to intimidate them. The
                    transfer was successful. As you know the NATO military headquarters are just
                    near Mons alongside the French frontier. I might point out, just as far away
                    from Brussels as they could possibly locate.</p>
                <p>The other major problem I had to deal with was an uprising against the central
                    government in Zaire, the old Belgian Congo. And as you know, there are many,
                    many Belgian residents in Zaire. I recommended to Washington that we help the
                    Belgians with air transport planes to get them out. I have a recollection of one
                    of my friends from the Department coming out to see me in Brussels and saying,
                    “Ridgway, we're going to accept your recommendation. But if something goes
                    wrong, there has to be a scapegoat, and you know who its got to be.” As a matter
                    of fact, I think that's all right. I think that if you're in a policy job, in a
                    policy making job, I think it's quite right that you rise or fall by the policy
                    recommendations. Some of my Foreign Service colleagues think that they should
                    have the right to make foreign policy recommendations, but be held blameless
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you happy with your time in Belgium? You certainly
                        accomplished a lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I was happy. Speaking particularly of my next assignment in Portugal, the
                    people say, “You must have loved it, the beaches are so fine.” People forget
                    that most of us in the Foreign Service go into it for the work to be done, and
                    for the challenges to be overcome. I know very few of them who go into it,
                    excepting non-professional people, for the lush side of the career. The social
                    whirl is quite secondary. That's why from the point of view of the professional
                    challenge, I was more stimulated by my assignment to Syria, than I was by any
                    other.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Portugal, I was very fond of. The Portuguese are a very strange people.
                    They're not at all Mediterranean. They're rather dour. There's a quality of
                    sincerity about the Portuguese that I like. They take a long time to know, and
                    they take a long time to know you. But when they do they're very faithful
                    friends. There I had four interesting, as well as pleasant, years. You better
                    ask me about my main problems.</p>
                <p>The ongoing challenges, of course, were the African colonial wars in Angola and
                    Mozambique. There isn't much you can do in such a situation. Of course we did
                    what we could. We tried to encourage the Portuguese towards a peaceful solution
                    of the problem. During my stay there I went down on two long...</p>
                <p>I visited all the local provincial capitals in both colonies. The truth is
                    usually between the extremes. On the one hand I was able to appreciate the work
                    which the Portuguese had done and also appreciate their exaggeration thereof in
                    their propaganda. But I must say that when you look at the condition of those
                    colonies now, and I have visited Angola since independence, they were heaven
                    compared to what they are today. I say that because, for example, of their claim
                    that blacks and whites were treated equally. But I visited enough factories, and
                    I spoke with enough people, to be quite sure the blacks were being paid
                    considerably less than the whites were for the same work. But this did not
                    interfere with the fact that there were many local blacks who identified
                    themselves with Portugal. It was not perfect, but on the whole pretty good. I
                    would say somewhat better than the relations between the French and the
                    indigenous African tribes. But that's ancient history now.</p>
                <p>The other challenge which I had to deal with was renegotiating the Azores base
                    agreement. We had been there for years without an agreement, on sufferance. I
                    was fortunate enough to be able to negotiate an agreement. Now we send down a
                    special negotiator from Washington to handle such things. The Department was
                    satisfied at that time to let the local ambassador handle it. Fortunately in
                    this case he was able to handle it successfully.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else about your ambassadorship to

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Oh, I might recount an amusing incident.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be great.</hi>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: I forget what the issue was, but I was instructed by the Department to
                    make a foreign policy point, publicly. It happened that I was going up to make a
                    speech in Oporto. It was a significant local event, and in my speech, which was
                    quite serious, I made the points which I'd been instructed to make by the State
                    Department. However, in the introduction, I said, “I belong to a wine-loving
                    family, and since the age of fifteen I have appreciated vintage port.” Well
                    somewhat to my chagrin, the papers the next morning barely mentioned the policy
                    point I'd made, but they all stressed that the American Ambassador appreciated
                    vintage port since he was...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. Why you'd think they'd take into account that you
                        were born in Paris. I guess not. How did your diplomatic career end after

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I'd had three embassies, and two quasi-ambassadorial jobs, and the
                    only embassy that interested me was Paris. And the day that Paris went to
                    someone else, I resigned. I was asked by my old friend David Rockefeller to take
                    on a new job, that of Director of International Relations of the Chase Manhattan
                    Bank. I thought that this was more interesting than taking on another
                    embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Those things are for others to judge. What's been written up most is the
                    secret conference between General Clark, and four members of his staff, who came
                    by submarine to meet with some of the resistance leaders near Algiers. The word
                    was not used then, now its become fashionable. The meeting was with the key
                    people with whom we were working and took place three weeks before the landings
                    in North Africa. It happened that Ambassador Murphy had asked me to organize the
                    meeting. It nearly became a catastrophe when the Vichy police got wind that
                    something was going on, and a section of Vichy troops closed in on us in a farm
                    house along the coast. There was a lot of difficult moments getting our visitors
                    out safely. This episode has been written up a lot. It's not the most important,
                    but the most spectacular.</p>

                    what I told a couple of Senators who were visiting me at one of my posts. One of
                    them said, “Ambassador Knight, what can we do to help the Foreign Service?” And
                    I said, “I think the best thing you can do is to leave it alone for ten years.”
                    I think the Service suffers with these constant reorganizations. And I think
                    there is a non-recognition, the quality of any race, any color, and any
                    religion. But I'm completely against making mandatory the admission of certain
                    fixed percentages. I think it's just as stupid as if the Ford Motor Car Company
                    said its sales force would have to be composed of a fixed percentage of all its
                    workers from the sweepers on the shop floor to the top office. I'm for taking in
                    people of quality, with character, and of any and all races of the best people.
                    Not because they're white, or wasps, black, yellow, Hispanic. I know this is not
                    the mood of the day, but I feel very strongly about it. We need our very best
                    people to sell our country, and to represent it abroad.</p>

                <p>KNIGHT: I loved my years in the Foreign Service, and I still miss them. My wife
                    says, “If you were asked to go back to Syria tomorrow, you'd go like a shot.”
                    And I think it's so.</p>
