                <p>Interviewed by: C. Edward Dillery </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 14, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 14, 1996 and we are interviewing Arnold
                        Schifferdecker. The interviewer is Edward Dillery. Arnie, why don't we start
                        out by asking you a little bit about your background, where you were born
                        and where you came from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I'm from Missouri, a small farming community called Norborne
                    along the Missouri River in western Missouri not far from Independence where one
                    of my heroes, Harry Truman, grew up. I went to the University of Missouri at
                    Columbia and had a dual major in journalism and in history. It was in the study
                    of diplomatic history that I got interested in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your family background? Where did your folks
                        come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, they are all of German origin—Lutheran Protestant. My great
                    grandfather immigrated from Germany to Pennsylvania and then onward to Illinois
                    and eventually to Missouri where land was cheaper. I have a family of five
                    siblings and none of them hardly left the mid West, except myself. I guess I was
                    the black sheep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that brings us to what caused you to come into the
                        Foreign Service. How did you get interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, as I mentioned, in studying history, especially diplomatic
                    history of the United States as one of my elective courses in my history major,
                    I became very interested in the process of diplomacy and learned a little bit
                    about the Foreign Service just from reading and knowing a little bit about what
                    the diplomatic corps of the US was. After I graduated I entered the Navy and
                    pointed myself toward taking the Foreign Service exam, which I was able to pass
                    successfully three years after graduation and prior to leaving the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: A total of six years. I was in Naval Air in a squadron that
                    deployed to the Far East, the Pacific, on an aircraft carrier, the USS Ranger,
                    which had many port calls in Japan, where I understand you also served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. It might have even been at that time. What years
                        were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had deployments from our home port of San Francisco to the Far
                    East in 1960 and 1961. I believe that did coincide with your time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, that is exactly right. I left Japan in August,
                        1961. So you took the exam and came in in 1964. What are your impressions
                        about the beginning days in the Foreign Service? Any thoughts on the
                        training or what you found when you got here, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was very elated having made it through the exam process into
                    the Foreign Service. There was a bit of a hiring freeze during the time I was
                    waiting on the register, but they found enough money in 1964 before the end of
                    the fiscal year to have an extra class in September and I got my call in July,
                    1964. I entered into the A-100 training course which was then in the infamous
                    garage annex at Arlington Towers where many Foreign Services officers were
                    trained initially. I was very impressed with the orientation training we
                    received. I didn't come in with a language and was given French, a world
                    language, to hopefully get off language probation. But, unfortunately, they
                    assigned me, my first posting as a junior officer, to Istanbul, although it was
                    fortunate in one regard, I really enjoyed Turkey and I went back to the country
                    again much later. But, I couldn't use my French and I didn't get off probation
                    until later with a little bit of extra effort on my part using my French to
                    achieve a tested 3/3 rating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like me. What was the oral examination
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The oral was about an hour and a half of grilling. It was not the
                    long, complex oral review that you might have gone through, this was in 1963. It
                    was a panel of Foreign Service, a couple of ambassadors, a civil servant from
                    the Office of Personnel Management, someone from another agency and someone from
                    the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That was in Washington at what is now the Office of Personnel
                    Management where the Board of Examiners resided for a brief period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you finance your own way out here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Fortunately I was in Washington because I was finishing my tour
                    of duty in the Navy in the Pentagon as an information officer. As I mentioned I
                    had studied both journalism and history and I was pegged by the Navy when I came
                    off sea duty to be a flack for the Pentagon during McNamara's time. It was a
                    very interesting time, by the way, with the “Whiz Kids” in the Pentagon and the
                    beginnings of our engagement in Southeast Asia..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the oral examination what was the tenor of it? I
                        remember when I did it, it was more designed to see how you would react
                        under pressure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, I can remember the first couple of questions. They wanted
                    to elicit a fairly extensive answer about the objectives and aims of the
                    Alliance for Progress, which was then being promoted for Latin America by
                    President Kennedy. Fortunately, I was au courant on that one. They asked me some
                    factual questions, somewhat trivial pursuit in nature and I remember getting
                    most of those except one, I couldn't identify the strait between the North Sea
                    and the Baltic which is Kattegat; I thought for sure I had failed then and
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family status when you came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was married without children at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The training lasted, as I recall, 16 or 17 weeks. Then I went
                    into language training for 4 months only, and almost reached the 3/3 in French,
                    but not quite. Then I was given the consular training and was off to Istanbul as
                    vice consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find when you got to Istanbul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I mentioned previously that while in the Navy I had been in the
                    Far East, but had not traveled to Europe or the Middle East. I found Istanbul
                    quite exotic and very interesting. I, of course, was an enthusiastic, interested
                    junior Foreign Service officer. My wife and I tried to settle in as quickly as
                    we could. I remember apartments were particularly difficult to find.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of housing did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We were required at that time to find our own housing and
                    received an allowance from the State Department which limited us to certain
                    areas and prices of apartments. We managed to find something suitable with a
                    small view of the Sea of Marmora between two other apartment buildings. It was
                    very pleasant getting settled in there. The people all spoke Turkish, of course,
                    and I only had English and French, so I immediately began a post language
                    training course in Turkish and was able to acquire at least a courtesy level of
                    the language during my time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that the old post language programs were
                        useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I thought they were quite useful, even essential, just to get
                    around in the city. My wife also took training so that she could get around on
                    her own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you fit the language training into your day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I did it during my lunch hour at my desk. We had native speakers
                    who would come in and who had been trained in the FSI method, that is no use of
                    English, start right out, sink or swim speaking the language. Of course, we had
                    a workbook or text that I was able to study in the evenings, but basically we
                    used tapes and the native speaker to get the accent and the sound of the
                    language and then a lot of vocabulary and grammar study when we weren't with the
                    teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your specific duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: My first duty was vice consul in the consular section. I handled
                    American citizens problems, shipping and American seamen, and non-immigrant
                    visas. I had one interesting experience on the American citizens services side.
                    There was one American, a young lady who had married a Turk and was stranded in
                    Istanbul. Her husband had taken her passport away from her, gone to the United
                    States to work, illegally I might add, and she was living with his family in a
                    small village on the Black Sea as a virtual prisoner. She had had two children
                    by her Turkish husband by this time. We were able to get her and the two kids a
                    new passport, but we had to arrange for a loan from her family back in New
                    Jersey in order to get her plane tickets. We did manage to do that. The
                    Department was quite interested in the case. I learned from that how important
                    taking care of American citizens problems were. We ran into a lot of other
                    problems with hippies and others in Istanbul, people who were out of money. We
                    had a small fund in the consulate for helping American citizens who were
                    destitute and needed a little money for a night in a hotel or something like
                    that. But, that was the beginning of the great beatnik or hippie migration into
                    the Middle East and eventually into Asia and India, etc. We had another major
                    problem trying to persuade the Turkish authorities to release a young
                    19-year-old American convicted of hashish possession. His father came over from
                    the U.S. and virtually camped out on my doorstep. It was tough persuading the
                    Turks to be lenient when we were otherwise pushing them to crack down on drug
                    smuggling. Does this sound familiar?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Turkish authorities responsive to requests for
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They were rather stiff and forma back then—in 1965. There were
                    vestiges of the Ottoman bureaucracy alive and well in Istanbul. We did have a
                    very competent Foreign Service National, who had been employed by the US
                    government way back when the embassy was in Istanbul before the capital was
                    moved to Ankara. He was born in Montenegro and his family had moved to Istanbul
                    during the migrations after the Ottoman Empire was progressively ousted from the
                    Balkans. His name was Abdurrahman Bey and he was the most distinguished looking
                    and acting gentleman I had ever met. He knew, of course, elegant French,
                    Turkish, who knows what Balkan languages, and English as well and we relied on
                    him heavily as our main interface with the provincial and municipal authorities
                    in Istanbul in order to get things cleared through customs, all sorts of
                    problems involving Americans who had either been robbed in the covered bazaar or
                    had run out of money. Abdurrahman was respected and was able to intercede very
                    effectively with the local authorities. In fact, Foreign Service Nationals of
                    that caliber were in many of our embassies at that time in the Middle East and
                    were valuable people whom we certainly miss now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think in those days working for the United States
                        government was probably one of the best jobs in any given country. With
                        changes in the value of the dollar and in the governments we still get good
                        people but not quite that layer of really, really excellent folks that we
                        had in many posts that I was in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I agree totally with you.</p>
                <p>There was one other duty I had while in Istanbul which I thought was illustrative
                    of our sometimes convoluted dealings with the so-called Ottoman bureaucracy. In
                    retrospect, it was more a Turkish nationalistic kind of bureaucracy rather than
                    what one might call the classic Ottoman bureaucracy, which at one time was very
                    efficient and a major reason why the Empire lasted over 400 years, but
                    eventually became corrupt like so many bureaucracies do. I was assigned, after
                    my stint in the consular section, to the commercial section to replace the
                    commercial officer who was going on home leave in the summer. My primary duty
                    then was to make arrangements for American exhibitors to obtain foreign exchange
                    allocations to import goods to exhibit at the Izmir International Trade Fair,
                    which was an opportunity for American companies to introduce new products into
                    Turkey. At that time foreign exchange was very scarce and the allocations by the
                    Turkish government for American firms to exhibit goods were strictly controlled
                    by the Ministries of Commerce and Finance in Ankara. The Istanbul consulate was
                    responsible for taking these allocations and parceling them out to the American
                    importers.</p>
                <p>At that time IBM, which had an office in Istanbul, wanted to introduce its new
                    IBM Selectric typewriters with a Turkish typeface...remember the round ball?
                    They had developed the Turkish ball at some cost to the company and they wanted
                    to market it to Turkish consumers, especially government and businesses. What
                    happened was, IBM went ahead and developed their Turkish ball, which was
                    reliable and as good as the English one, assuming they would get their import
                    permit or foreign exchange allocation. To my dismay and the company's dismay,
                    that particular year the Turkish government was interested in marketing some low
                    grade Turkish tobacco languishing in warehouses in Izmir which apparently they
                    had difficulty selling abroad. The government, rather deviously cleverly, I
                    thought, decided to force all latecomers to the Izmir Fair including IBM, to buy
                    an equivalent share in Turkish lira of a quantity of that tobacco and export it
                    in exchange for having a foreign exchange allocation for their exhibits. To
                    cover themselves, the local IBM wanted to claim that I had misled them, but
                    that, of course, was not true. I had, in fact, been very scrupulous in telling
                    them that we did not yet have their foreign exchange allocation even though they
                    went ahead and developed their typewriters.</p>
                <p>But in the end, IBM swallowed its pride and disdain for this Turkish method of
                    doing business and bought, I believe, about a hundred thousand dollars worth of
                    Turkish tobacco and dumped it abroad somewhere. I am not sure whether they
                    managed to market it or just dumped it into the ocean. But, it was a good lesson
                    for them and me, that you don't make commitments, especially financial
                    commitments, until you know what the rules of the game are. I ended up being
                    commended for doing the job right, although at one time I thought I was going to
                    be the fall guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you end up in the good graces of IBM as well as the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. We had a few laughs about it later on after the Fair got
                    underway, and IBM, by the way, did succeed in introducing its product and did
                    exceptionally well in selling Turkish Selectric typewriters all over the
                    country, some still in use today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hopefully it was a net gain for them. You mentioned that
                        you changed your assignment. Was it a rotational thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had the rotational junior officer program in effect at that
                    time. Shortly thereafter, I understand one of the Congressional Committees found
                    out about this “training program” and told the State Department basically to
                    knock it off. I believe it was Congressman Rooney at that time who said, “You,
                    the State Department, had told the Congress that you were recruiting people who
                    were able to hit the ground running, so why do you have this training period for
                    them? They don't need training, they are very capable people and you don't need
                    the extra positions for training abroad. Initial training in Washington should
                    be sufficient”. So, that program was phased out about the time I was going
                    through it. I was designated as being in the political cone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were brought into the Service as a political
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. At that time you were allowed pretty much to self-designate
                    your cone and I had wanted to be a political officer. I received rotational
                    training in consular, commercial and econ. I did some econ reporting on Turkish
                    industry. Also in administrative duties for six months. About the time I was
                    ready to go into the political section, I was transferred to Tel Aviv as the
                    ambassador's staff aide, so my political work came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The consul general was Lansing Collins. We had two first rate
                    career ambassadors in Ankara. We had Raymond Hare and later Parker Hart, both of
                    whom are well known Foreign Service icons of the 1950s and ''60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our relations with Turkey like during that
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: During the 1965-66 period there were problems over Cyprus, but
                    they were not as great as they were to become in your time later on and in my
                    time in the early ''80s. Relations in general between the US and Turkey were
                    firm, under control, not necessarily warm, but the Turks needed us and we needed
                    them, as the anchor of NATO's southern flank. I would say relations on a whole
                    were steady, without major bilateral issues. We still had a fairly active aid
                    program and of course close military cooperation and ties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of sense did you have for the internal political
                        climate with regard to Istanbul versus Ankara at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, there has always been sort of a rivalry and maybe a little
                    bit of jealously between the two cities as to which is really the center of the
                    Turkish universe, but it was always acknowledged that Istanbul was the business
                    and commercial capital of the country and Ankara was the government capital. One
                    can see why there might be feelings of rivalry between the two cities but there
                    was not any noticeable tug-of-war between the government in Istanbul and the
                    government in Ankara. That tension still exists, even with the spread of
                    economic prosperity to other parts of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wondered if there was a sense that Istanbul felt itself
                        to be semi-autonomous, doing its own thing? I know the central government is
                        pretty powerful in Turkey and always has been.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think because of that centralization the provincial government
                    and the government in Ankara were on the same wave length at that time. The
                    government was headed by Ismet Inonu at that time. He had been Ataturk's
                    right-hand man. He gave way, while I was there to Suleyman Demirel. Elections
                    were held in 1965. Demirel's party came into power shortly thereafter. That was
                    the beginning of a more wide open democratic system, which eventually led to
                    political excesses and periods of near anarchy and which prompted two military
                    interventions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On a cultural note, I have always felt the consulate and
                        former embassy in Istanbul as one of the most interesting buildings, but
                        clearly very inefficient. I know there was a recent effort to move to a more
                        modern building out in the country. What are your thoughts on that as a
                        former inhabitant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The consulate general building in Istanbul is a former 18th or
                    19th century Italian palazzo on a very narrow, busy commercial street. In terms
                    of our security requirements today, it certainly doesn't meet the criteria, but,
                    it is a beautiful old building and has over time been kept up and restored. It
                    has marble interiors and some ceiling frescos in the style of 18th century
                    Italian palazzi. There was a story that an early American Minister to the
                    Ottoman Sultan, had won that building in a poker game. I don't know whether that
                    was ever confirmed, but it makes a nice story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a great place and I for one hope we keep it. Let's
                        move on to Tel Aviv. Did you have a direct transfer after only one year in
                        Istanbul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, it was a direct transfer. I was assigned specifically as the
                    ambassador's staff aide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It happened without myself being consulted. In those days junior
                    officers weren't expected to know ahead of time where they were being sent,
                    although telegrams were usually sent authorizing travel orders saying that the
                    panel had met in Washington and assigned X to post Y, and that was what happened
                    in my case. I was very happy to have the assignment. It sounded very prestigious
                    to me only a first tour junior officer and going into my second tour and working
                    for the very prestigious career ambassador, Walworth Barbour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go directly to Tel Aviv or have home leave in
                        between?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I went directly to Tel Aviv from Istanbul taking home leave
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Israel at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very peaceful at the beginning of my tour, except for a few
                    border incidents, incursions by Palestinians along the Jordanian/Israeli border
                    and later along the Syrian/Israeli border. Those incidents were at the time we
                    thought pin pricks. Of course, Nasser was in power in Cairo and there were
                    constant fulminations and threats against Israel and the United States. Less
                    than a year later the situation changed dramatically. Israel and Syria exchanged
                    artillery fire in the Golan Heights in the spring of 1966 and there were air
                    battles. This led to a closing of ranks among the Arabs and Nasser's crossing of
                    the Suez, ostensibly to aid Egypt's Arab brethren. He forced the UN peacekeepers
                    to evacuate the Sinai which had been virtually free of military forces. When the
                    Egyptians began moving toward Israel's border in large numbers with heavy armor,
                    the Israelis became very alarmed and, as you know, struck preemptively in what
                    was called Six Day War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there throughout that tense period. How about
                        some reflections on the job of aide to an ambassador and what you learned
                        about the ambassador's jobs and aide's jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, my job was mainly pushing the paper, making sure it was
                    ready for the ambassador's review and sign off. It was the typical staff
                    position which occurs in Washington as well as in the field. I was required by
                    the ambassador to translate his handwriting, which was sometimes difficult to
                    read, into cables when there was no secretary to take the dictation.
                    Occasionally I was given special assignments by the ambassador to go to the
                    Foreign Ministry. Basically it was delivering things which he had promised Abba
                    Eban or the head of the Israeli MFA's American Section in Jerusalem. Of course,
                    with the embassy in Tel Aviv and the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, it involved
                    a trip of about 45 minutes to an hour each way.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>One of the demarches I delivered was a demand for financial restitution after the
                    Six Day War. You may recall that during that War there was a bombing of an
                    American ship, the USS Liberty, a communications ship, manned by the National
                    Security Agency. A number of Americans were killed and wounded in that attack.
                    Israel claimed it had been a mistake, they said they had thought it was an Arab
                    ship. Some people later said the Israelis knew exactly who they were bombing,
                    i.e., they didn't want us monitoring what they were doing. But, in any case, we
                    were called after the attack by Israeli Defense Minister Dayan to come to the
                    aid of that ship, saying that the ship had been disabled and there were probably
                    casualties on board. They flew our military attach� out by helicopter to
                    communicate with the ship. This communication was by flashing light as it was
                    night and because the bombing had knocked out all of the electronics. So, we
                    found out that there were around several dozen Americans killed or wounded in
                    that attack. Somewhat later I presented to the Foreign Ministry a bill for the
                    damages suffered by the ship and indemnity for the families who had lost loved
                    ones. The total, I believe, was around ten million dollars. That was presented
                    to the American Section in the Foreign Ministry. The recipient, an Israeli named
                    Shlomo Argov (later Ambassador to Mexico and the UK), said that he would refer
                    the matter to the highest levels in government and eventually, I understand,
                    compensation was paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was interesting being the person who was the messenger
                        in that case, I am sure there was a lot of tension. I do remember that there
                        was a lot of tension about that case. During that period were there any
                        special meetings or events between the United States and Israel, prior,
                        during or after the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There certainly were a lot of consultations. The Israelis did not
                    tell us ahead of time they were going to attack. They claimed they were acting
                    in self defense and a case could be made that an attack by the other side would
                    have left them crippled and maybe unable to do what they did which was to
                    destroy the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces on the ground before they
                    were able to attack Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. President Johnson was livid about
                    not being consulted and demanded an explanation, which Ambassador Barbour
                    obtained from Prime Minister Eshkol. Basically, the explanation was, Israel
                    could not afford to wait to be attacked; by then it would be too late to defend
                    themselves. Shortly after the onset of the Six Day War a White House emissary
                    came from President Johnson. He spent some time in the embassy getting in touch
                    with the Israelis and coordinating with the defense establishment on the
                    resupply of ammunition and other armaments that Israel expended in the war.
                    There were a lot of postmortems conducted and delegations came to us and
                    Israelis traveled to the United States. The most immediate action came up in the
                    Security Council. Abba Eban, the Foreign Minister, flew to New York and the
                    famous UN Security Council Resolution 242 was negotiated with our help and 242
                    continues to be one of the basic documents undergirding today's peace process.
                    One of its main provisions, the inadmissibility of territorial gain by conquest,
                    has helped to constrain Israeli expansionists and to keep the Arabs at the
                    negotiating table.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other manifestations of the special relationship
                        between the United States and Israeli were apparent at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Relations at that time were strong, and durable. We didn't have
                    the extent of defense cooperation, perhaps, that we do today or intelligence
                    sharing. Although that began to increase in the aftermath of the Six Day War,
                    and more perhaps after the 1973 war. But one incident did come up which pitted
                    Israel and the United States against one another. That was on nuclear
                    proliferation. We did get word through open non-intelligence sources that Israel
                    was producing weapons grade material. As a result of that we made a number of
                    demarches to Israel warning them not to proceed on that track, much as we had
                    done with other countries such as Pakistan, that had moved towards the
                    capability of producing nuclear weapons. Of course, the Israelis did have a
                    small reactor for research purposes and Israeli scientists are among the best in
                    the world in many fields. But, this did create some tension in US/Israeli
                    relations which continued long after I left and were never totally resolved
                    because Israel still today is not a signatory of the Non Proliferation
                    Treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to internal politics. Was there any problem or
                        perceived interference in Israeli internal affairs? I'm not thinking of
                        official interference, but the large Jewish community and visits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There were no major issues of such interference or accusations of
                    such interference in Israeli internal affairs. There were a couple of amateur
                    efforts by well meaning private Americans to come over and try to promote peace
                    between Israel and the Arabs. One of them was a Rabbi from Massachusetts named
                    Baruch Korff, who wanted the Israelis to take unilateral steps to open relations
                    with Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states, which he had visited—again strictly on
                    his own. It was an interesting effort but the Israelis were not yet ready, nor
                    were the Arabs ready to talk to the Israelis about peace. The logjam was broken
                    only after the 1973 war, when the Arab side recovered some sense of pride and
                    Israel began to realize that periodic wars did not advance their goal of
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to the unofficial side in Israel, was the fact that
                        Israel did have difficult or no relations with its neighbors affect your own
                        ability to move around? Did you feel isolated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: To some extent yes. Before the Six Day War when Jerusalem was a
                    divided city and before Israel took it over entirely, we were able to go to
                    Jordan through the Mandelbaum Gate which was torn down by the Israelis the day
                    after the Six-Day War when they unified the city, literally opening roads that
                    had been closed for almost 20 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The feeling of isolation increased somewhat after that because only persons on
                    official business could travel between Israel and Jordan by land. Of course, one
                    could go by aircraft to Cyprus and take Middle East Airlines to Beirut, Amman
                    and Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Israeli accreditation cause problems in Arab
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The Arab countries would not accept for admission into the
                    country a passport containing an Israeli visa, but at that time the State
                    Department could issue a second passport to those on official travel which Arabs
                    would accept. So, we were able to get around the problem although we did not
                    have diplomatic relations while I was there with most of the Arab countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were living conditions like in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Living conditions were quite comfortable. Houses were small, but
                    clean and well built. We were mostly living north of Tel Aviv in the so-called
                    diplomatic ghetto, Herzliyya Petuach, which contained not only foreign diplomats
                    but also Israeli civil servants and business people. It has become quite a large
                    Mediterranean resort city and residential area north of Tel Aviv stretching
                    further north today to the old Roman city of Caesarea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any interesting aspects of how Ambassador Barbour ran an
                        embassy or anecdotes about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Ambassador Barbour was a professional in every sense of the word.
                    A seasoned diplomat who had served in Moscow, London and at least one Middle
                    East post, when he came to Tel Aviv. He was ambassador in Israel close to 13
                    years. I think I was his eighth staff assistant. He had the habit of coming in
                    in the morning at normal business hours, a little bit later than most of his
                    staff. His papers were stacked up and waiting. He would look through his papers
                    and pared down the sheaf of telegrams that I had filtered for him and taken out
                    some of the stuff he had no interest in, although he had a wide interest in
                    everything to do with managing the embassy as well as all the political and
                    economic cables. Along about eleven or twelve he would finish his paperwork and
                    confer individually with the section chiefs. If he had a demarche or some matter
                    to take up, which was frequently with Jerusalem, he would get in his old
                    Cadillac limo with his driver Shalom and head for the Jerusalem hills, and do
                    his work with the Foreign Ministry, usually with the Foreign Minister, himself,
                    or the Director General of the American Section, Moshe Bittan. Then he would
                    return home for lunch and would not return to the office. I would run paper out
                    to him if necessary. Once or twice a week he would try to play golf. As the Six
                    Day War approached and in the aftermath of the war he was unable to find time to
                    play golf and he frequently spent the entire day in the embassy. His work habits
                    were somewhat laid back but he was a very efficient processor of the substantive
                    material. He had a competent staff who kept him informed. It was a very smooth
                    running office, a real model of an efficient embassy. Though it was not a very
                    large embassy, like London and Paris...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: My recollection is that it was around 40-45 officer personnel and
                    20 or fewer American support personnel. If you count State and the other
                    agencies you would have maybe 65 Americans and then a fairly large local
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ambassador Barbour was a fairly colorful character
                        which you have indicated. Were there any other anecdotes about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I would say he was a gentleman through and through. He treated
                    everyone with respect. He never raised his voice and I never heard him say a
                    word in anger. His sister, who was also a single person, as Ambassador Barbour
                    was, used to come out during the Christmas holidays and be his hostess for the
                    holidays and the ambassador would have staff in for Christmas parties and
                    American occasions like the 4th of July. He entertained in a very certain
                    special way. He had a table that seated 24 people and he liked to have the table
                    full. He had a wide range of government and business contacts that he
                    entertained regularly. Of course, there were many CODELS to Tel Aviv. The saying
                    during my day back then was that any congressman who was running for reelection
                    had to travel to one or more of the three I's—Israel, Italy and Ireland—in order
                    to show the constituents that they cared about the old country. The ambassador
                    kept a very set schedule for his dinners. A set amount of time for drinks, a
                    certain amount of time for dinner, followed by cigars and cognac for the men in
                    the library, then rejoining the ladies in the salon afterwards. Everybody was
                    usually out the door by 11:15 or so. He was a man of very regular habits. He was
                    a rather portly gentleman and had been a chain smoker. He had the beginning of
                    emphysema while I was there. He would frequently alarm visitors when he would
                    pull out his inhaler, lean way back in his chair and spray it to get his
                    breathing back on track. He would say, “No, go ahead and speak,” when they would
                    stop as he used his inhaler. Remember, these devices were not very common back
                    then as they are today with asthmatics and people with breathing problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the DCM's job like under an ambassador who was so
                        interested in everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The DCM did not have as much of a role in handling the substance
                    of the embassy work as he did in overseeing the administrative part of the
                    embassy because the ambassador handled the major issues himself or dealt
                    directly with his section heads. I don't know that this was necessarily a
                    personality issue between Ambassador Barbour and DCM, Bill Dale, but only when
                    Barbour took his home leave did Dale have a little more scope to run the embassy
                    and deal with the political issues which the ambassador liked to do when he was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the social life. Were you as staff aide involved
                        in protocol duties as well as other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oh, yes, I was required to make sure that the guest list was in
                    order. I maintained the lists of official government personnel, business people
                    and other movers and shakers. I advised other sections; on protocol and
                    procedures. I conferred with the ambassador on who his guests were to be and
                    with his secretary who handled the invitations. I placed the guests in protocol
                    order and made sure the seating was according to protocol requirements. That
                    turned out to be not such a difficult job. I always showed the seating plan to
                    the ambassador ahead of time so that he could play around with it and
                    occasionally he would change things around and not go by strict protocol if he
                    noticed there might be some conflict with people sitting beside each other.
                    Normally, he was a stickler for rank order. Remember, he had been DCM in London
                    many years. I frequently was invited as a fill in and was out by the swinging
                    doors normally. So, I got to participate in many of these formal dinners. He
                    enjoyed having black tie dinners as well, so that was part of his entertaining.
                    It probably no longer exists at that embassy, although I am not certain. The
                    Israelis, of course, were very informal, usually not wearing a coat and a tie to
                    the office, but they certainly did at his residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife invited to those dinners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: At that time I was divorced and single. I remarried later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Okay, let's move on to your next assignment in the
                        Department. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: My assignment to the Department was not the one I particularly
                    wanted, it was to the Public Affairs Bureau. I was hoping to get a regional
                    bureau where I would be a desk officer or something like that. I was assigned to
                    the Bureau of Public Affairs in the media liaison office. It turned out that I
                    enjoyed it quite a bit. Dealing with the press in the State Department can
                    sometimes be ticklish but normally if you establish good relations with the
                    press you develop a mutual respect and a way of working out issues and problems.
                    I was not in the spokesman's office, at that time Bob McCloskey. Media liaison
                    meant assisting broadcast or print media to get interviews or to have access or
                    to answer their questions about certain issues that were not necessarily of a
                    daily nature, daily development of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>At that time Vietnam was a major issue in our foreign relations and we were doing
                    our best to get the story of Vietnam according to our interpretation out to the
                    media. We provided access to many of the policy makers in the Department on
                    Vietnam as part of that effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Another duty in the Bureau of Public Affairs, a special assignment I had, was to
                    deal with the media during the 20th anniversary of NATO celebrations in 1969,
                    held in Washington. That involved a month of preparations ahead of time. A lot
                    of foreign journalists came to report on the anniversary and President Nixon
                    spoke at the Department of Commerce's auditorium where the ceremonies were held.
                    I think at that time the Acheson auditorium was deemed to be too small to hold
                    all the delegations from all the NATO countries plus all the visitors and media,
                    so it was held in the Department of Commerce.</p>
                <p>Another special assignment that I had was to be the head of media liaison for the
                    INTELSAT conference. The organizing conference of the International
                    Telecommunications Satellite Organization, which was also held in 1969. Leonard
                    Marks, who was head of the USIA at one time, was the head of the US delegation,
                    and I was his press advisor and spokesman and head of the media relations. Now,
                    that was a highly technical conference and I had no experience dealing with
                    technical issues such as telecommunications up to that time, but reading
                    furiously through all of the documentation that we had and background papers, I
                    was able to master in perhaps a superficial but adequate way, I thought, the
                    material that I was dealing with. Since a lot of the discussions, both in
                    plenary session and in the smaller committee groups, was highly technical, I was
                    required to do press releases to make it intelligible to non-technical
                    personnel. Some of the journalists had better technical knowledge than I, but I
                    felt very good about the whole thing because I was complimented on the clarity
                    of the press summaries that I had done and shown to others in the US delegation
                    before they were put out, of course. I had tremendous help from Michael Bandler
                    from USIA who did a good job working with me on these press releases. So, I
                    received compliments from Ambassador Marks and from my own Public Affairs bosses
                    for that.</p>
                <p>So, in fact, just about any assignment that you get in the State Department, even
                    if it is not your first choice, usually turns out to be an interesting one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the media liaison office fit into the
                        organization? It wasn't part of the news division I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, it was part of the public liaison and press liaison offices
                    and at that time was under a man by the named Bill Blair, who was quite an
                    astute office director. He was a political appointee, but a very pleasant
                    gentleman to work with who later went on to work for the Nature Conservancy as
                    an environmentalist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that mean then that you dealt more with journalists

                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Sometimes when they had a special request to interview the
                    Secretary of State—at first Dean Rusk and later on Cyprus Vance—or his deputies,
                    we handled that. The press office only handled the daily noon news briefing and
                    press releases of a perishable nature, that is, releases of information about
                    breaking developments. The media liaison and public liaison offices, where I
                    worked, dealt with less perishable requests for interviews and information. Our
                    office also sent officers out from the State Department all over the US on media
                    and broadcast interview tours. Some of them participated in the talk shows of
                    that time. As I mentioned, we were interested in getting our story out on
                    Vietnam and that was a big part of it.</p>
                <p>As a small aside, I personally was not very enthusiastic about our Vietnam
                    policy, but I was told by my superiors I had better get with the program and
                    mind my responsibility regardless of my personal views. I agreed on this. At
                    that time, I didn't feel that our policy was immoral or of a nature that would
                    cause a person with a conscience to resign. I felt, rather, that practically and
                    strategically it was the wrong fight, the wrong war, at the wrong time. I was a
                    great admirer of Walter Lippmann who said, “Never get involved in a land war in
                    Asia.” And, of course, that warning was ignored and to our peril we paid the
                    price for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That raises an interesting question about the Foreign
                        Service, which is how do you go about divorcing your own feelings? This
                        arises in other cases usually in smaller issues than that but where you are
                        required to carry out acts that you might not necessarily agree with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I have never been put in a position where I was asked to do
                    something that I felt was absolutely repugnant to my principles. Sending someone
                    out on a media tour to get the administration's side to the public on Vietnam
                    did not appear to me to be an immoral responsibility. It wasn't my primary
                    responsibility in any case. In fact, I felt that even though I opposed our
                    deepening involvement in Vietnam in the late '60s, that if I had been assigned
                    to Vietnam I would go because maybe I would be convinced that what we were doing
                    was right, because most of my information like many other people's information
                    about the Vietnam situation even in government came from extensive press
                    reporting. So, I was willing to be persuaded that maybe there was a lot more to
                    Vietnam than I had thought. But, of course, I wasn't assigned to Vietnam, for
                    whatever reason, so I was never able to test whether my beliefs were correct or
                    not, except through the passage of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have the situation where you were required to
                        go in and make a demarche that you found it hard to do with a straight face?
                        I felt I had some of those where you knew what you had to say and what they
                        had to say and it was almost more of a ceremony than a real attempt to get
                        them to change their views.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I have done demarches later on in my career where I knew the
                    answer was going to be “no,” but generally speaking I felt we had a point to
                    make. I was never given a demarche to do that I totally disagreed with. Maybe I
                    disagreed with the way the issue was presented and, of course, we in the Foreign
                    Service are able to take a little bit of liberty occasionally to repackage the
                    demarche and make it more palatable to the host government, although we have to
                    be careful how far we can go on that, as you know. But we do have to make the
                    case as best we can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that is the point, that one of the reasons that
                        they need to have people abroad is precisely because they have a feeling how
                        best to present something to the host country, whereas the people back in
                        Washington, especially in the case of some of those wholesale demarches
                        where you get just a general line and you have to figure out how to make it
                        the most effective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That is right. I know in cases where I worked for ambassadors, I
                    know more than one who managed to rewrite his instructions taking more liberties
                    than I would have as a political officer or political counselor in my
                    presentations. Although I was able to elaborate them differently, perhaps, I
                    didn't rewrite my instructions as some ambassadors I know have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having that assignment in Washington, was your thought it
                        was good in the end to get back and see what was going on in the States?
                        Would you have rather stayed overseas? How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: At that time I was ready to be in the Department of State. I felt
                    that two tours abroad and then one tour in the Department would give me a better
                    grounding. I toyed with the idea of working on the 7th floor in the Secretariat,
                    but ended up taking the advice of one of my mentors, former ambassador Bob
                    Dillon, who was in Personnel at that time and whom I had known in Turkey when I
                    was in Istanbul. His advice was that perhaps I should go for a hard language and
                    use that as my vehicle to get a good job overseas. Up to this time I had not had
                    a good solid political reporting officer job overseas. I was assigned to Persian
                    language training and to Tehran as my onward assignment. That assignment to
                    Tehran was changed to Kabul in mid language training. Fortunately the languages
                    of both countries are quite similar, although there are differences between
                    Dari, which is Afghan Persian, and Iranian Persian. But, I was able to make the
                    transition. I was assigned to Kabul in 1970 as the second political officer in a
                    two man section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get language training by volunteering for it or
                        was it suggested to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I picked the language and the post went with the language.
                    Normally at that time, it was just beginning to happen, we didn't have an open
                    assignments bidding process that came later as a result of the Foreign Service
                    Act of 1980, but I was able to spot a job opening in Tehran a year a head of
                    time and volunteer for the language training at the same time with the help of
                    my assignment officer. So, that was the beginning of identifying jobs before
                    language training, although there were many who went into Arabic language
                    training or Chinese or other hard language training assignments that lasted more
                    than a year in some cases where you didn't know where you were going yet. You
                    only knew you would go to one specific country, or in the case of Arabic, one of
                    several countries that would be able to use your language skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as it was, even knowing your assignment, you didn't
                        know it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That is right. I had the position identified and didn't have the
                    orders in hand. What happened was someone left their post in Kabul a year ahead
                    of plan, so I was asked to fill that gap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't really lose the job in Tehran to somebody else
                        through a tour extension or something like that, it was because of the Kabul
                        situation where they needed somebody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right. The job, I think, in Tehran that I was going to was
                    left unfilled for a period of time or someone filled it without language
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what was the situation in Kabul in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, in Kabul it was quite peaceful and tranquil. The decade of
                    the '60s in fact leading up to the early '70s was a period when the King of
                    Afghanistan, Zahir Shah, introduced parliamentary democracy. He called it an
                    experiment in democracy because the country had not known much of that kind of
                    governing. Up until that time they had a series of strongmen prime ministers
                    where the king presided over the country but did not rule...reigned but did not
                    rule. The prime ministers up to the early 1960s were strongmen, usually members
                    of the extended royal family. After that time commoners were brought in to head
                    parliamentary governments. That process was just going strong when I got there
                    and was just beginning to show some results after two elections in the '60s.
                    Politically the country was stable. We had a fairly extensive AID program, not
                    so much in dollar terms being something between $25-$30 million per year, which
                    was not a large program in those days, but a large number of AID people. We had
                    a lot of Americans on the ground at that time. Probably, including Peace Corps,
                    250 or more Americans plus dependents. There were a lot of contractors for
                    AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>When I arrived the ambassador wanted to more fully integrate the economic and
                    political sections of the embassy with AID. He felt that some of the AID
                    projects that we had had in the past, rightly so, had not worked out so well in
                    every case because they had not been grounded in the political or economic
                    realities of the country. So, we worked very closely with our AID counterparts
                    and with the rest of the country team. The ambassador at that time was Robert
                    Neumann, who later became our ambassador to Morocco and then, for a short time,
                    to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a non-career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right. Robert Neumann was an academic from California and
                    had been ambassador in Kabul for three years, at least when I got there, and was
                    ambassador for another two years afterward.</p>
                <p>In any case, things fell apart in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Shortly after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, so it stayed stable the whole time you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Pretty much so. There was a serious drought the summer that I
                    left and in order for our emergency assistance program to be operational in any
                    country we had to have a request for the government, basically a declaration of
                    an emergency. After much pushing on the Afghan government which was reluctant to
                    issue a declaration, they did issue one which was basically drafted in AID.
                    Because it was viewed in the country, by the people, as begging for assistance
                    instead of being self-reliant as Afghanistan frequently had to be because there
                    were no aid programs in earlier years, the king and his government were severely
                    criticized and a year later a coup was staged by a member of the royal family
                    but a coup in which Muhammad Daud, the leader of the coup, ended up by seizing
                    power and abolishing the monarchy. That eventually became the end of both
                    parliamentary rule in Afghanistan and independence. The pro-Russian Communist
                    Party in Kabul was able to seize power on behalf of the Russians who moved in
                    quickly several months later in 1979 and you know the rest of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there signs of this happening even while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very little. During my time, 1970-72, we saw the interests of our
                    government and the Russians as being compatible in Afghanistan. Afghanistan had
                    occupied the position of a buffer state between British India and expanding
                    Imperialist Russia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. That status continued
                    in independent India and Pakistan and the Soviet Union. The United States felt
                    that there were no basic incompatibilities between our position in Afghanistan,
                    which was to assist in a modest but responsible way to educate and help the
                    Afghans develop their own country. Whereas the Russians had a larger program, an
                    infrastructure program and military assistance program. We had a very, very
                    small military training program where we trained some of the Afghan officers.
                    But the Russians had a heavy arms supply and training program of a Russian
                    nature and the army ended up being the nucleus for the Russians to move in and
                    take over. And, of course, the infrastructure, the highways, that they built in
                    the north were used to bring tanks into the country from the Soviet Union to
                    take over control of the capital and other major cities in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our relations with the Soviet Union at that time were kind
                        of on the upswing anyway weren't they, leading toward detente?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, it was a period of detente, the period of the Nixon
                    administration when we were signing some of our first strategic arms agreements
                    with the Brezhnev regime and no one felt that Russian interests were threatened
                    by what we were doing in Afghanistan or any other country. There was a large
                    international presence of Germans and United Nations. It was only when the Shah
                    of Iran started courting the Afghan government in the mid-1970s and tried to cut
                    deals to wean the Afghans away from dependence on Russia that the Russians
                    became alarmed. The Russians thought that we, Iran and Pakistan were trying to
                    roll them back—sort of a U.S.-led “plot” against them. In fact, some believe
                    that this was the proximate cause for the Russians to move into Afghanistan
                    1979, even though Iran was already engulfed in the Khomeini revolution
                    generally, I believe the Russian occupation was mainly opportunistic, that is,
                    they moved in only when the Afghan Communists took over the country but then
                    began to falter and they needed outside help to survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have talked about the monarchy and the coup that took
                        place later, but what about the ethnic divisions in the country, were they
                        sort of stamped out at that point or like in many places very real at all
                        times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The ethnic groups of the country were basically bought off by
                    royal patronage and by the classical political balancing of one group off with
                    another. Each ethnic group seemed to feel that it had a piece of the pie, small
                    as it was and not expanding very rapidly, but yet it seemed that every ethnic
                    group had a stake in the country continuing on an even keel with political
                    stability and a growing national consciousness, which was occurring when I was
                    there. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you free to travel around the country and did you do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I certainly did. The highway construction had not been completed
                    fully in the north yet, but there was access through the Hindu Kush Mountains
                    north of Kabul to Mazar-e Sharif, to the beginning of the steppe country of
                    central Asia and to some of the rug weaving country of northern Afghanistan,
                    which is where I first developed a taste for oriental rugs. I traveled north,
                    south, east and west. We were able to travel out of Afghanistan by road to Iran,
                    which was quite remote on the other side of the country from where Kabul was in
                    the eastern part of the country. We were also able to travel by road, built by
                    the United States incidentally, through the Kabul Gorge and the Khyber Pass into
                    Peshawar, Pakistan. It happened that that road was the main road used by the
                    Americans who were being evacuated out of Pakistan during the Indo-Pak war of
                    1971 when I was there, and that is another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There were large numbers of Americans in Pakistan when India and
                    Pakistan went to war over Pakistani repression in the East Bengal, out of which
                    emerged Bangladesh in 1971. Because of my language capability, I was asked to go
                    to the border at Torkham, which is at the head of the Khyber Pass on the Afghan
                    side, to help process Americans being evacuated from Pakistan along the road to
                    Kabul and then to fly out of Kabul by the Afghan National Airline to either Rome
                    or Frankfurt where they flew. We did process several hundred American families,
                    dependents, contractors working on the big Tabala Dam project in Pakistan and
                    had a very interesting time of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I camped there for three days and nights; no hotel or anything
                    other than a sleeping bag and a couple of tents to stay in; we cooked our own
                    food. On the second day there was a big stir at the border as Zulfikar Ali
                    Bhutto, shortly to become prime minister of Pakistan, was coming through the
                    Khyber to go on to Kabul to fly to New York to defend Pakistan's position at the
                    UN Security Council which was drafting a resolution to stop the war. I spoke
                    with him briefly, verified that he was going to Kabul (because all of
                    Pakistanis, civilian airports were closed down), and wished him a safe trip. I
                    then radioed the Embassy, to make sure our government was aware of what was
                    going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later Pakistan became quite a big player in Afghanistan,
                        was there any of that at that time or did they have enough problems with
                        India to not worry about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Relations were correct but occasionally tense during my time
                    because Afghanistan would periodically play what we called the Pashtunistan
                    card. The idea was to have the Pashtuns on both sides of the border, which was
                    the British imposed Durand Line dividing the Pashtun tribes between Afghanistan
                    and Pakistan, to be brought together. It was never stated that Afghanistan
                    wanted to annex this territory, but the Afghan idea was to use this as a
                    pressure point on Pakistan and also as a way of stirring up Pashtun national
                    sentiment in Afghanistan, thereby diverting attention from internal problems
                    that bedeviled the monarchy and the government in Kabul. In any case the tribes
                    straddling the mountainous border area moved more or less freely back and forth,
                    a feature that was very useful later on for supplying the Afghan freedom
                    fighters against the Russian invaders, as you noted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the benefit of those who might not know, what are the
                        major tribal groups in Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The main Afghan ethnic groups are roughly six in number. The
                    predominant group are the Pashtuns who comprise maybe 40-45 percent of the
                    population. There are the Tajiks, the next largest group, maybe 20 percent. I
                    use approximations because nobody ever knew exactly how many people belonged to
                    each ethnic group or the total population of Afghanistan which was roughly
                    estimated to be about 14 million during my time there. Then you had the Uzbeks,
                    probably less than 10 percent also predominantly in the north along with the
                    Turkmen who numbered less than 150,000. In the southwest and west you had the
                    Baluchi group, related to similar groups in Iran and Pakistan, including some
                    who were partially nomads and who led their camels and donkeys and herds of
                    goats to higher elevation pasturage in the northern part of Afghanistan in the
                    summer and then went down to the Indus Plains crossing the border into Pakistan
                    to winter over. They were always a colorful sight with whole families on the
                    move and chickens riding precariously on the backs of donkeys or camels. Last
                    you had a Shia ethnic group called the Hazara living mainly in the center of the
                    country. They numbered about one million and were said to be the descendants of
                    Genghis Khan's army. I mention them last because the Hazara was low man on the
                    totem pole, the most discriminated against and occupied the lowest rung on the
                    economic ladder, in part probably because they were Shia instead of Sunni which
                    was the predominant Muslim sect of the country. Physically, they were also easy
                    to identify because of their Oriental features. In fact, many of them found jobs
                    as domestics for American homes in Kabul. I had a cook and a bearer in my time
                    in Kabul, both of whom were Hazara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting how that kind of situation arises where
                        Americans get to know countries through their associates, including their
                        servants, and there is a little bit of bias towards that. Did you sense that
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Of course, and the reason being that many of the other ethnic
                    groups would not take such menial positions. You even saw on the streets of
                    Kabul in my time heavily loaded wagons and carts being pulled by Hazaras, by
                    people, not by donkeys or by horses or any other beast of burden. You would see
                    two Hazaras at the yoke pulling these heavily laden carts around Kabul. This
                    really grated on Western sensibilities and gave many the impression that Afghans
                    could be very cruel to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, here you were new in your first political assignment.
                        Did it meet your expectations and what were your thoughts about that aspect,
                        the professional side of your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was given pretty much free range on doing political reporting
                    on domestic political issues. I handled some foreign political issues, but that
                    was usually the chief of the section, the counselor's job. At one time I was
                    acting counselor and handled all of the issues, both demarches and foreign
                    policy issues as well as domestic political reporting. The non-urgent political
                    reporting was done, still in my time in the early '70s, by airgram and I did a
                    weekly roundup of political developments in and around Kabul and elsewhere in
                    addition to special reports that we did about the parliament and the parties or
                    the judiciary or the media, the student movements at the universities, and that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>We had wide access to all of the domestic political elements in the society,
                    including the Communist parties. In fact, I even had Communist party deputies to
                    my home for lunch occasionally or for a reception. The ambassador and the DCM at
                    that time felt that they would not entertain Communist party diplomats, so I was
                    able to do that with relative ease, although it wasn't a frequent occasion. We
                    would have rival party members who didn't speak to each other at my home for a
                    reception with a buffet, usually a garden type of reception in the summer when
                    the weather was pleasant which it was in the evenings, Kabul being at over 5,000
                    feet altitude.</p>
                <p>Getting back to my job, one of the things I was able to do was to get a lot of
                    the other official Americans to let me know what was going on in their areas. We
                    had many contractor employees for AID. I would not be able to cover all of the
                    ministries that they dealt with in the course of their work, so frequently at
                    meetings at the embassy or in social occasions I was able to talk with them.
                    They would tell me what was going on at the university and I was able to tell
                    them the larger political picture into which that fit and it helped them to
                    understand some of the problems they were running into. So, we had a mutually
                    beneficial exchange of information within our own official family. Of course, I
                    dealt a lot with other international residents, including the UN people and
                    colleagues of other embassies and their political officers for the exchange of
                    information and of course with the Afghans. I frequently attended parliamentary
                    sessions where I learned about the concerns of the entire country. And, of
                    course, we took field trips all over the country, political reporting trips to
                    size up other regional and ethnic concerns as we discussed earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>That sort of sums up what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able then to be independent with the language not
                        taking an interpreter with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I had to use my language capability. Fortunately I had developed
                    it well enough, although certainly not with total fluency, to speak Dari and
                    understand it and also to read the newspapers. We did have a couple of local
                    employees who did a lot of translations of articles for the benefit of all
                    Embassy staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned being able to meet with Communist party
                        leaders who the ambassador and DCM did not feel free to see. Isn't that
                        really one of the great things about being a mid-level reporting officer,
                        that you do have access to a wider range of people than the ambassador, who
                        by the very nature of things is confined to ministers and permanent
                        secretaries and ambassadors and people like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, I agree with the thrust of your comment and question
                    entirely. In some cases if the ambassador had entertained say, Communist
                    parliamentarians who were viewed by the establishment as the lowest of the low,
                    he would have been roundly criticized by the Afghan establishment and probably
                    warned. Yes, it did allow me to have a wide range of contacts, although there
                    were some who did not want to be entertained by an American. The main plotter of
                    the Communist coup of 1979, Hafizullah Amin, head of one of the Communist party
                    factions, hated the United States because he had gone to Columbia University and
                    had flunked out and there may have been some other incident besides that which
                    soured him on us. But he came back to Afghanistan with a chip on his shoulder
                    toward Americans and was very reluctant to accept any kind of invitation, even
                    from me. It took a while before he agreed to have lunch one-on-one with me
                    because he, being a very secretive person and a plotter at heart, thought that
                    other people would find out that he had had met alone with me at the embassy. I
                    frequently dealt with parliamentarians on a one-on-one basis as it was easier to
                    get information that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, he finally did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: He did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a good lunch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I had an Afghan cook who knew how to serve a good lunch and many
                    Afghans would not drink alcoholic beverages in front of each other, but in a
                    one-on-one situation some would enjoy a beer, nothing stronger than that, or a
                    glass of wine. Whereas at a reception they would not imbibe in front of others.
                    But, there was a certain amount of reluctance to do things that might be
                    considered risque in their society with a foreigner. That is because Afghanistan
                    was still emerging from being a closed conservative Muslim society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he open up in these conversations at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oh yes, quite easily. Usually Afghans would have some message
                    that they wanted to get across to the Americans and, of course, we would be
                    basically trying to get more understanding and information about what was going
                    on in that session in parliament that morning or the day before. So, we were
                    basically in an information gathering mode and understanding mode, and they were
                    in a message giving mode. Many of the parliamentarians, not necessarily the
                    Communists, were interested in taking a parliamentary tour in the United States,
                    which was one of the benefits of our International Visitors Program we were able
                    to hold out to some of the parliamentarians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a very important point because I always felt those
                        International Visitors Programs were a wonderful way to spend money. How
                        many did you have during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We only had one group that made it off the ground while I was
                    there. They spent over a year haggling over who should go. At one point they
                    decided that no one should go. Eventually, one group did go, but it was like
                    pulling teeth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically you had entered the Service wanting to be a
                        political officer and now you were one. Looking back on the two years was it
                        what you thought it was going to be, as good as you thought it would
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was as good or better than I thought it was going to be, the
                    opportunity to be a classical political reporting officer in Afghanistan. There
                    weren't high priorities for reporting in Washington about things going on in
                    Afghanistan at that time, but there was quite an audience as I found out when I
                    went back on consultations later and did a lot of debriefing around the town,
                    including at Langley, the State Department and other departments like Commerce.
                    I was surprised to find out that there were some people at the National Security
                    Council who followed some of our reporting there.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I had a fairly free rein to do a lot of reporting on subjects of my own choosing,
                    although there were the classic set of issues that we are normally interested in
                    in looking at domestic developments in any country. In fact, I was rewarded by
                    being nominated as the Foreign Service reporting officer of the year for my
                    reporting in Kabul. I didn't get the award, but I was one of six nominees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure the reporting came in handy later on when
                        Afghanistan did become important because a lot of the characters were
                        probably the same people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Some of them were but many were done in to my chagrin and dismay,
                    of course. It was a brutal change which occurred later on when I was Afghan desk
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will get to that later, but what years were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That was the first coup, I'm talking about 1973, after I had
                    returned to the United States. I first did a mid-career fellowship at Princeton
                    for one academic year and then I was recruited to be the desk officer for
                    Afghanistan and also worked on Pakistan affairs from 1973-75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Kabul, do you have any other incidents or
                        anecdotes about your time in Kabul that you want to report on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There is one other anecdote I felt proud of being involved in. At
                    that time, of course, the cold war was going strong. We had a Russian defector
                    on our hands who had come into the embassy. Of course, we had a procedure of
                    turning any would-be defector over to the normal interviewing people assigned to
                    the embassy. It was decided by higher authority in Washington that the United
                    States would accept custody of this person and try to get him and his family out
                    of the country because Afghanistan would not itself facilitate the departure of
                    a Russian national to the United States. They did not want to alienate their
                    Soviet friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The embassy decided, after putting our heads together, to take this man, his wife
                    and two children out in a large diplomatic pouch across the land border, again
                    at the Torkham border crossing that leads to the Khyber Pass into Pakistan where
                    the government of the time would be more amenable to allowing someone to depart
                    its country who had entered it irregularly. I was in one of two cars that
                    accompanied these people to the border. Now, this Russian was a technician, he
                    was not a political officer of the embassy, which would have been a much bigger
                    prize, but it was felt that he knew enough about things going on in Russia and
                    Afghanistan and how the Russians ran their technical assistance programs, that
                    he was worth lifting out and being brought back for debriefings. When we got
                    near the border, this was in daylight, which was the only time you could cross,
                    we put the family all in one big diplomatic pouch with a few holes in it in the
                    back of a carryall van, one of the embassy's vans, and I was following in an
                    embassy car driving it myself without a driver because we didn't want any Afghan
                    driver involved in this operation. We were all a little bit nervous but we went
                    through the normal procedures of checking out with the Afghan authorities and
                    checking in with the Pakistani authorities, and there were the inevitable waits
                    of 15 or 20 minutes at each side of the border.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of nervousness, but we did manage to get them through and I was
                    rather proud of the fact that we were able to help a man and his family to
                    freedom, which was what they opted for. They had made a difficult commitment and
                    choice to do that without much idea of where or how they were going to end up.
                    From what I heard, everything went successfully and as far as I know they are
                    living somewhere here in the United States today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is an example of the kind of unique thing that occurs
                        to you once in a while. It seems to me that in most posts at some point
                        there is a moment when something quite unusual occurs and usually you are
                        glad that you have the chance to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a big American mission in Kabul, mostly AID, but
                        some Defense people, I assume, and some intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, we had intelligence officers and a Defense Attach�'s office,
                    although no Naval Attach� however, Afghanistan being a landlocked country, and
                    in addition to a sizeable AID Mission we had a Peace Corps presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your observations on the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had Peace Corps when I was assigned to Turkey and I had some
                    encounters there with Peace Corps and their problems. The Peace Corps in
                    Afghanistan was largely dealing, at least when I arrived, with teaching English.
                    There was a voracious appetite to learn English, although we did have some
                    volunteers in health and rural development. That rural development program
                    expanded a lot while I was there. We sent more people outside the main
                    provincial cities, especially during a terrible drought that I referred to
                    earlier in 1972 when people were starving and we had to develop some programs
                    mainly to get food to the people who needed it. The Peace Corps was very
                    instrumental in making that happen. They developed a food-for-work program and
                    implemented it very successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a useful program for the United States, for the
                        volunteers, for Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think it was useful for Afghanistan to develop competency in
                    the English language. Overall, I would say that since the Peace Corps is a
                    people intensive type of development program, a lot of the benefits of it were
                    the personal contacts that later on when the Russians invaded and many Afghans
                    were forced to leave the country they were able to reestablish contact with
                    volunteers back in the United States that they had known. I have heard enough of
                    these stories and have experienced myself the nice human aspect to the kind of
                    Peace Corps work that deals on a daily basis and very intensively with host
                    country people, in this case Afghans. So, I would say that it was not as
                    effective as you would want it to be, but on the human level very effective in
                    cementing personal relationships and useful in teaching some skills, especially
                    language skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we move to Princeton. Tell us about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I applied for the Department's university training program while
                    I was in Afghanistan and the one that appealed to me, in part because Princeton
                    has a Middle East department, was the program at Princeton University. However,
                    I was assigned to the Woodrow Wilson School, their school for international
                    public affairs. That was my base and that was where the other half dozen
                    Department, USIA and AID officers were assigned during the academic year of
                    1972-73, along with other agencies' mid-careerists. There was a group of about
                    28 USG officers at Princeton during my year there. I found it very
                    beneficial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it not an area oriented course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was and it wasn't. It was under the area studies training
                    rubric of FSI's university training program. I spent about half of my time in
                    the Middle East department and half of my time at Woodrow Wilson. I was very,
                    very busy. I either audited a number of courses, or I took a number of courses
                    for credit, especially at Woodrow Wilson, including some international economics
                    training and some development economics training which I felt I needed a better
                    theoretical grounding in. I found those very beneficial along with Middle East
                    politics studies and some specific country studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it wasn't where everybody goes through the same
                        courses, it was an individual course for each of the participants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Everybody was able to tailor their individual program. I felt
                    that this was very useful because there were a lot of areas that I wanted to get
                    into and sample and at least do one semester of work in, if I could. I wrote a
                    number of papers while I was there. The school found them useful and so did I. I
                    did the same work that a graduate student would have done and had I been more
                    methodical, perhaps I could have gotten a master's degree from the effort. I
                    ended up doing a lot of course work and getting a lot of credits but no
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your papers on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I wrote papers in part on my own experience and some on research.
                    I did a paper on modernization in developing countries using Afghanistan as a
                    case history. I did some papers on areas where I had had some knowledge but not
                    direct experience. In an international politics course I did some studies of
                    Middle East crises and how they were handled in the government compared with the
                    Cuban missile crisis, for example. We had had a graduate course which used the
                    Cuban missile crisis as a focus and a book by Graham Allison on that crisis
                    which you may be familiar with. So, I was able to extrapolate from our
                    discussion on that crisis was handled and how the lessons learned could apply,
                    for example, to the Arab/Israel situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, all in all it was a very useful year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very much. I felt that it was a perfect time to pause between
                    assignments and to get a better theoretical grounding, and to perhaps equip
                    myself with some economic credentials which I lacked.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am afraid with the budget strains we are having less and
                        less of that, if any at all, now. Then you went back to the Department. How
                        did that assignment process go and how did the system work in getting you an
                        assignment from your university training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was programmed into the position of Afghanistan desk officer
                    almost as soon as I got to Princeton. The vacancy was coming up for assignment
                    and it was felt by a number of people who were familiar with my work in Kabul
                    that I would be the appropriate person to take over the desk. So, I was
                    consulted this time ahead of time and it became a natural fit for me coming out
                    of Princeton and taking over the desk. I felt it might be too narrow being
                    associated with one country for four years, but while I was Afghan desk officer
                    in Washington, I was also given responsibility for part of the Pakistan
                    portfolio. So, I had a little broader duties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole office was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, the office was NEA/PAB, which was Pakistan, Afghanistan and
                    Bangladesh, Bangladesh being the new boy on the block having become independent
                    two years earlier. I immediately began my duties as desk officer by going to
                    Kabul to fill in during the summer for the political section where one officer
                    had left a year early and the counselor was taking home leave. They put me in
                    the job to hold down the political section for three months until the political
                    counselor and another officer returned. It was at that time that the coup by
                    Muhammad Daud took place in 1973. I reported on the coup, its implications for
                    us and for the region, and the usual things you report when a new government is
                    established and we establish our relations with that government. So, that was
                    very much appreciated by the Department and I got one nice compliment from
                    Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was our ambassador in India at that time. He
                    thought it was some of the best reporting he had seen in that type of situation.
                    I felt coming from Moynihan, a political appointee that it was doubly a
                    compliment for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A nice person to have one from, Daniel Patrick. Going back
                        to a situation like that, did you find that it was good having all your
                        contacts, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was like I had never left, Ed. Somehow I just fit myself right
                    in with the situation, which was calm and peaceful the first couple of weeks
                    until the coup occurred. Then there was a lot of chaos and uncertainty for a
                    while and then excitement. But, I did look up all my old friends, or as many as
                    I could, until the coup occurred and then many of them withdrew from contact not
                    knowing which way the wind was blowing. It was tough for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the coupists among your friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, especially those who were in the Foreign Ministry. There was
                    one particular person who was involved in the coup who I had been friendly with
                    and many of the other embassies didn't even know because he was somewhat of an
                    outcast with the previous regime. He became the acting foreign minister which
                    was very handy. Although I had very little access to him because the coup
                    planners and plotters were all in meetings every day, meeting among themselves
                    and not with foreigners particularly. So, it was up really to the ambassador to
                    make contact with the new powers to be in the ministries during those early
                    days. Of course, I had to leave and go back and be the desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was still Bob Neumann, but he was leaving and going to
                    Morocco, so as soon as I got back to Washington I began briefing Ted Eliot who
                    was selected as our new ambassador and getting him out to post subsequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It strikes me that so often when there is some kind of
                        emergency we are changing ambassadors. I don't know if we plan it that way
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I guess what frequently happens is that we make our orderly plans
                    but the world is so disorderly that it looks like we haven't planned our part
                    properly, when in fact we have just been overtaken by events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what impact did the coup have on US/Afghan
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Initially, there was a lot of suspicion that the US was against
                    the coup plotters, that we were pro-monarchy, so we were handled with some
                    coolness and there wasn't a very friendly relationship in the beginning. And, of
                    course, because we were changing top level staff at the embassy as well, there
                    was a diffident period, you might say, in our relations. But, there were no
                    basic changes on the ground. The new regime wanted us to continue our
                    development assistance. They were a little bit chary of our Peace Corps
                    operation, but in the end they allowed that to continue. It was cut back a
                    little bit in size for a while, however. The basic interests that we had in the
                    country, that Afghanistan continue to be an independent state and not be
                    beholden to any one power, such as the Soviet Union, were not damaged by this
                    coup. However, the abolishment of the monarchy created a political vacuum in the
                    country that eventually was filled by the Communist coup of 1978/79 and the
                    Russian invasion which really ended for a period of time Afghanistan
                    independence and its stability. It still is a fractured country today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the effect of the 1973 coup on regional
                        relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There was initially a period of tension between Afghanistan and
                    Pakistan and also with Iran. At that time Iran was still a friend of the United
                    States and we put a lot of stock in our relations with Iran and didn't want to
                    see tensions with Afghanistan or with Pakistan, for that matter. So, there was a
                    period of time when we felt that this new regime of Muhammad Daud was behaving
                    in ways that cranked up the existing tensions between the two countries.
                    Afghanistan also had problems with Iran on the division of waters between the
                    two countries, the Helmand River. The tensions with Pakistan over Pashtunistan
                    issue were larger and created more problems. What happened was that in both
                    countries, relations were repaired and made actually stronger. Bhutto came to
                    Afghanistan on an unannounced visit. He flew from Pakistan to Kabul giving one
                    hour notice that he was coming and the Afghans were unable to say “no” and it
                    turned out to be on a smaller scale, a Sadat visit to Jerusalem. In any case,
                    because of Bhutto's charisma and personality he was able to overcome some of the
                    tensions that the two countries had. Later the Shah of Iran began offering
                    economic assistance to Afghanistan which the Afghans became interested in and
                    that tended to diffuse some of the tensions between those two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So actually it was sort of similar in the case of both the
                        important neighbors and us in terms of a little dip and then a resumption of
                        kind of normal, positive relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. Except in the case of Iran. I mentioned earlier that there
                    was some Russian suspicion that Iran was acting on our behalf to wean the
                    Afghans away from Russia and that may have contributed to nervousness on the
                    part of the Russians that when their cohorts staged a coup they felt constrained
                    to protect that investment they had made in Afghanistan and come to the aid of
                    the fledgling Communist regime in 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of other questions about Kabul that come to mind.
                        What were our relations with the Russian embassy there during that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They were cordial but not real friendly. Remember we were still
                    in the period before the Gorbachev era that loosened things up 10-15 years
                    later. So, we maintained some social contacts, but not warm and fuzzy types of
                    relations on a personal basis. They were more or less correct and cordial but
                    not warm. All U.S. officials were required to report to the State Department any
                    contact with Russian or Soviet bloc officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the British with their role in regional
                        interests? Were they an actor at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The British were quite active in Afghanistan at that time,
                    subsequently they have become less concerned and involved. But at that time they
                    maintained a small, but effective embassy staff and a small assistance program,
                    primarily cultural and educational rather than the kind of development aid that
                    we were providing. The British orientalist connection was very useful because
                    they did train their officers in Afghan Persian or Dari, and had a couple of
                    officers who spoke the language and were quite well plugged in. So, we had good
                    relations with the British then which was mutually beneficial in the exchange of
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other major foreign players? What about the
                        Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The Indians and Pakistanis both had well staffed embassies, in
                    Kabul. India provided some aid, mainly agricultural assistance. Pakistan did not
                    have an aid program, as I recall. Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan during
                    my time were cool. Relations with India were warmer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your three months you went back to the Department
                        and joined PAB. What did you find when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I found that we were getting ready to change ambassadors for one
                    thing. We were dealing with an entirely new government in Kabul that we were
                    still feeling out. There were some visits by Afghan ministers or deputy
                    ministers and some other functionaries to the United States that the embassy was
                    pushing. They relied very much on me to help develop a useful productive program
                    for them that would help to reinforce, shore up our ties with the new
                    government. We found, also, that one of the big Afghan bilateral problems was
                    their tolerance toward farmers growing opium poppies, increased acreage,
                    including on some of the land that we had helped reclaim and irrigate in the
                    Helmand Valley. Now those poppy fields did not exist when I was there but in a
                    space of a year or two they began to develop. They had had some traditional
                    cultivation closer to Pakistan in the Jalalabad region, but this was something
                    new and something that we really began to remonstrate with the new government
                    about, to cut back those newly blooming fields of opium poppies in the Helmand
                    Valley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Never completely. I think while the Daud regime was in power we
                    were able to get their attention and get them to take some action. But in the
                    traditional poppy growing areas of eastern Afghanistan we made very little
                    headway. A lot of this cultivation was off the main roads, difficult to survey
                    and to see. At that time almost all of the opium gum was exported into Pakistan
                    where labs had been developed in the tribal areas on their side of the border to
                    refine opium into morphine and heroin.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were the only products from opium poppies I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, there is a legitimate use for morphine base by the
                    pharmaceutical industry for codeine and one of the Tylenol products and other
                    such products, pain killers. But, most of our purchases of pharmaceutical opium
                    were from India, where the cultivation was more controlled and from Turkey,
                    after the Turks decided to control their cultivation in the 1970s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are your observations of the role of a desk
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The State Department desk officer has to be a jack of all trades,
                    has to be an outgoing person having to deal with a lot of agencies of the US
                    government, with the private sector, with the general public. It is amazing how
                    much correspondence a desk officer gets from who knows what sources, schools,
                    etc. for information on the country. The main job I felt I had to do in my stint
                    as desk officer for Afghanistan, was to keep my embassy informed about
                    developments in Washington that affected what the embassy was doing and to keep
                    all of the agencies of the US government informed about what was going on in
                    Afghanistan and what we thought we should be doing in order to support our
                    interests in the country, our interests in the larger region and also to support
                    our objectives in getting the country, itself, in this case Afghanistan, to
                    support our initiatives in other than bilateral forums, like the United
                    Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of communication did you have with the embassy
                        in Kabul? Only by telegram or did you have telephone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had very poor telephone service with Kabul. Maybe that was a
                    blessing in a way because we weren't always second guessing each other every
                    morning or late in the afternoon, whenever it would be the right time to
                    communicate with each other on the phone. In an emergency we did communicate by
                    phone, but it wasn't the usual way. We normally communicated by
                    official-informals and by regular State Department telegram. Official-informals
                    were cables that had limited distribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it really have limited distribution? Did those ever
                        bounce and cause problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Not in my experience. But there was a potential for it, I
                    suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we have e-mail, I guess, with everybody, so it is a
                        whole different world in terms of communications. It was a lot more formal
                        and on the record in your time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: One of our highlights when I was on the desk was Henry
                    Kissinger's interest in Afghanistan, the first time a Secretary of State had
                    done so for quite a while. First of all we had to persuade Henry that it was in
                    our interest and in his interest too that he visit Afghanistan while on a trip
                    to India and Pakistan. It didn't take a lot of persuading because I think he
                    understood the strategic position of Afghanistan as a buffer state between the
                    free world and the Communists; also his curiosity I think got the better of him.
                    He got quite interested in what made Afghanistan tick when he read a few of our
                    briefing papers. While he was there he also was treated to an exhibition of that
                    famous Afghanistan sport, buzkashi, which is a horse mounted sport involving the
                    body of a goat which is used basically as a football between two opposing teams.
                    Of course, Kissinger was also interested in Afghanistan's relations with Iran.
                    He wanted Afghanistan to be supportive of our objectives in Iran and to be at
                    peace with Iran. So, he spent a lot of his time in his official talks in Kabul
                    trying to persuade the ultra nationalistic Muhammad Daud to be nice to the Shah
                    of Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did he get along well with Daud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Apparently they hit it off very well and Kissinger pronounced
                    himself pleased with his visit there. Nancy Kissinger, unfortunately, arrived in
                    Kabul with some bug she had picked up earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, likewise, Daud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Daud and his cronies were citing that visit for many years
                    afterward as evidence of interest of the United States in Afghanistan, to have
                    sent such a formidable personality and Secretary of State as Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It only became less important in 1978, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is June 11, 1996. We are interviewing Arnold
                        Schifferdecker and the interviewer is Ed Dillery. Well, Arnie when we were
                        here last we had just finished your 1973-75 stay on the Afghanistan/Pakistan
                        affairs desk. We were talking about Secretary Kissinger and his efforts in
                        that area. We are now moving to your next assignment that started in 1975 in
                        the Bureau of International Organizational Affairs, as deputy director for
                        policy planning. Could you tell us something about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I arrived in the Bureau of International Organizations (IO) at
                    the time the North/South dialogue was heating up quite a bit. The rhetoric had
                    really escalated in the early mid-70s. The oil shock, the OPEC countries cutting
                    off or restricting oil supplies had really shaken up the West and Henry
                    Kissinger, always one to be concerned with major events as Secretary of State,
                    decided that he would use the North/South dialogue and a special session of the
                    General Assembly on economic issues and justice, as the developing countries saw
                    it, as a vehicle for trying to bring the two sides together in a cooperative
                    mode. So, Kissinger ordered, at the time that I came into the Bureau, a series
                    of studies and steps to be taken, policies to be initiated, that would try and
                    entice the third world, basically the Group of 77 as it was called which was
                    already over a 100 countries by then, to enter into a more cooperative type of
                    interaction with the industrial countries. The Southern countries or the Group
                    of 77 countries, though they suspected Kissinger's motives, began to see that
                    there was some real effort behind the initiatives that the United States and
                    that Kissinger, himself, announced at the 7th special session of General
                    Assembly in New York in 1975.</p>
                <p>As a result of that session, which I helped to plan, the confrontational
                    atmosphere lightened up a great deal and a number of initiatives in the trade
                    and financial area dealing with aid and efforts to address some of the real
                    concerns of the Group of 77 began from that date. The effort was not to defeat
                    OPEC or to do some sort of short term measures that would win over the Group of
                    77, but to try and address some of the real concerns, particularly those
                    countries that had one crop economies or one commodity economies such as cocoa
                    or minerals or agricultural products that because of over supply or demand
                    changes prices would rise or fall rapidly and really crush their economies. So,
                    as a result we began to interact more constructively, with the members of
                    UNCTAD, which we had previously considered to be a second class forum as far as
                    dealing with trade issues or issues involving commodities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what UNCTAD is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: UNCTAD is the UN Commission on Trade and Development,
                    headquartered in Geneva. It is a UN organization and in a sense it was a rival
                    of GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs), also headquartered in Geneva,
                    where we preferred to do our trade negotiations, and we still do today with the
                    successor organization the WTO (World Trade Organization). But some of the
                    initiatives that we took to help moderate the price fluctuations through UNCTAD
                    I think caught the imagination of the Group of 77.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>This was one of the things that I worked on in the office of policy planning in
                    IO. It was a very exciting time because previous to that Henry Kissinger had not
                    paid a great deal of attention to the politics of the United Nations.
                    Thereafter, he paid a great deal of attention to it and in a way forced the
                    bureaucracy, not only in the State Department, but other agencies of the
                    government, to pay more attention to the North/South dialogue and the Third
                    World. Now, of course, some of what we did was rhetorical support and rhetorical
                    in nature, but there was, as I indicated earlier, a great deal of substance to
                    some of the initiatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you define in a little more detail what your office
                        did do? Did you actually conceive initiatives? Who did you work with? How
                        did you present them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: When I came into the office preparations were in full swing. It
                    was a small three-person office, actually four including a secretary. What we
                    did was we coordinated. The IO Bureau took orders from the 7th floor, from
                    Secretary Kissinger and his immediate deputies, to shape a new policy. We worked
                    out new initiatives with experts in the Economics and Business Bureau (EB) as
                    well as with other agencies in the government and the National Security Council.
                    Basically we were getting ideas from wherever we could find them, trying to
                    clear them through the bureaucracy and through the 7th floor of the State
                    Department. This had to include Treasury, of course, many times AID (Agency for
                    International Development) and the Commerce Department. Then we were shaping
                    these ideas and putting them in Secretary Kissinger's speech. The speech, which
                    went through more than a dozen major redrafts, was really the vehicle for
                    devising an entirely new approach and many new policies to deal with what was
                    viewed then as the North-South crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this special session actually took place, did we give
                        an indication to what we were up to to the other countries? What was the
                        pre-, during, and post special session diplomacy aspect of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Good question. We didn't telegraph our moves a lot before hand
                    because we were busy with an internal exercise, within the US government.
                    Therefore, when the speech came it had some impact and that was the idea. It was
                    not a total surprise, but it had a big impact on the tone of the entire debate.
                    Resulting out of that 7th special session, there were a series of meetings of
                    other bodies that dealt with development. I remember particularly there was a
                    meeting of UNCTAD in Africa and Secretary Kissinger went to that meeting and
                    followed up on some of the initiatives that he announced in New York with more
                    specificity and with more concrete ideas about what we wanted to do. There were
                    other meetings and policy initiatives with many other organizations of the UN
                    system, including the FAO, UN Development Program, UNCTAD and others. Many of
                    the initiatives were in the field of agriculture because many G-77 countries are
                    agriculturally dependent, so meetings took place in Rome after that. There were
                    a couple of new subsidiary bodies created in Rome. One called IFAD
                    (International Fund for Agricultural Development), and one of the initiatives
                    that we announced in New York was to put money into that Fund so that more
                    development funding in the field of agriculture and agribusiness could take
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you attend any of these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was not attending the meetings myself. My boss did attend some
                    of them. I was a worker bee. The title of deputy director of policy planning was
                    really too grandiose because it was a small office. My job was to work within
                    the bureaucracy in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, while they were having the meetings you stayed back
                        and when the inevitable discussions took place and requirements for changes,
                        you were the one who worked on that again to coordinate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, with other offices in IO and other bureaus in the
                    Department, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that effort with the G-77 continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I would say it never ended. It took off basically from that date,
                    1975, with some highs and lows between then and now. Development assistance
                    probably received the largest boost through the World Bank, through the
                    replenishments of the International Development Association of the World Bank,
                    through UNDP, through other regional banks, the Inter-American Development Bank
                    and other regional banks of the system. I would say the funds that we provided
                    to these regional banks and to the World Bank and to the UNDP, as well as
                    bilateral aid probably reached its high point sometime in the late '70s or
                    perhaps the early '80s. Although as you know after 1980 when President Reagan
                    came in our emphasis was more on security assistance and I would say there was
                    probably some leveling off of our development assistance in the '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The development assistance both bilaterally and to
                        multilateral financial institutions really was a big carrot for the G-77, a
                        big part of the initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very definitely. I think it was definitely needed. I don't have
                    exact figures, but I am sure that both the absolute amount that we provided then
                    for development assistance as well as expressed as a percentage of our GNP was
                    considerably higher than it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have just read a book which likewise I don't remember
                        the figures, but you are exactly right. You talked about the fact that
                        development assistance was a very important incentive for Southern countries
                        in the dialogue, but you also mentioned that we did make efforts to assist
                        countries whose economy was based on one commodity. What kind of things did
                        we do in that instance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: As I mentioned, we dealt with this in part through the UNCTAD in
                    Geneva. Under the UNCTAD there are a number of producer associations, countries
                    that produce some of these single commodity items that are used as ingredients
                    in finished products such as chocolate. Cocoa is a good example. Under UNCTAD
                    there is an association of the few producers of cocoa. I believe the Ivory Coast
                    being one of the main ones in Africa. Although we wanted a free marketing
                    arrangement as much as possible, as we opposed cartels per se, we had to
                    recognize that there had to be orderly ways to market these commodities so that
                    the price fluctuations would at least be moderated. So we worked in UNCTAD to
                    help make arrangements, such as buffering stocks, to prevent rapid price
                    declines or rises for these goods. I cannot go into the specific details, my
                    recollection is not that specific, but I think we did make a sincere effort to
                    try and deal with the problem. There were funds in fact created on which these
                    countries could draw when their income dropped rapidly. There were low or no
                    interest loans available to help tide them over until demand picked up. That
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you begin to see results from the Kissinger
                        initiatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think the first result was a result in the politics. The
                    politics, as I indicated earlier, moderated. The confrontational debate
                    moderated a great deal. Concrete results were not immediate. Certainly the
                    amount of development assistance from the United States picked up a great deal
                    in the years following that, but actual results in the situation of the Southern
                    countries probably took much longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you could see that the political situation had
                        improved say by less animosity toward or opposition to US activities in
                        regular General Assembly meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: On economic issues, yes, we saw a much more cooperative mode of
                    behavior and more resolutions that we had either abstained on or voted against
                    were adopted by consensus following that 7th Special Session. But, on the other
                    hand, in the General Assembly there are all of these political issues, the
                    Middle East peace process, which hadn't even begun then, PLO representation in
                    New York, and a lot of other political issues. We did not see, for example, a
                    better atmosphere right away on the ground on political issues, that is progress
                    on economic issues translating into more cooperation on political issues, than
                    we would have liked to have seen. But, that is the nature of the United Nations
                    and international politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in policy planning was that the only
                        activity or were there others that are worthy of comment as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The main effort, the main thrust while I was there during my two
                    years was on the economic side. That seemed to be the area that we were able to
                    contribute more. The other issues that were being dealt with within the UN
                    system were more or less handled by the line offices in IO and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were working on this other activity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, and a new activity basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the bureaucratics of it, you had just come from
                        a regional bureau and now you are in a functional bureau for the first time,
                        what are your feelings about the role of those two types of bureaus and how
                        they get along with each other and how they ought to get along with each
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I have had another tour later on in a functional bureau and I
                    would say the regional bureaus then and even today wielded considerably more
                    clout and their issues attracted more attention in the State Department.
                    Although it was felt in 1975 that a functional bureau like IO was getting the
                    attention of the Secretary of State. It was during that time as well that Daniel
                    Patrick Moynihan was our permanent representative in New York and he, in some
                    ways contradictory with some of Kissinger's goals, wanted to be more bold and
                    express our views more forcibly in multilateral fora like the United Nations.
                    That effort also changed some results. But, as I say, there was certain inherent
                    contradiction between trying to cooperate in the economic sphere and the sharper
                    political rhetoric we employed during Moynihan's tenure in the UN. In fact,
                    Moynihan resigned over alleged conflicts with Kissinger and his policy, although
                    it never came out in public in any way. Moynihan felt that he no longer had the
                    support of the bureaucracy in Washington when he left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really had almost two policies toward the UN, one for
                        economic and other issues and one for political issues, and the twain did
                        not meet sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think that is true. But, getting back to your question, I would
                    say overall multilateral diplomacy I would date 1975-76, that period, as a
                    period when multilateral diplomacy occupied more time of policy makers in
                    Washington, more tension because it was felt there were certain things we could
                    do multilaterally that we could not do bilaterally. And, I think that is prima
                    facie true because many of the policies that we now pursue have to be in
                    multilateral fora, such as trade agreements in the World Trade Organization, and
                    other organizations, such as the IAEA and UNEP, that do a lot of technical work
                    in the field of international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know later on we are going to talk about your time at
                        the USUN mission in New York, but as you speak it reminds me that here we
                        have several forces in the government involved in our relations with
                        multilateral organizations. You have the Secretary, himself, the Assistant
                        Secretary for International Organizations, the representative to the UN in
                        New York, and then a whole bunch of sort of semi-autonomous guys in Vienna
                        for the IAEA and in Geneva for those organizations. Not so much coordination
                        within regional offices, but how about coordination within the offices
                        within the US government which dealt with international diplomacy, how did
                        that work during that 1975-77 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It worked surprisingly smoothly in part because people perceived
                    Secretary Kissinger as a strong Secretary of State, a strong leader, one who
                    would be able to take disputes within the bureaucracy to the White House and
                    win. So cooperation was surprisingly smooth and not difficult. Complex
                    occasionally. There are always organizations within the US government who want
                    to have their fingerprints on the policy and their input, so time consuming.
                    But, I would say overall, coordination of our policy in multilateral
                    organizations was considerably smoother and less complex than it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I ask that question with an ulterior motive because you
                        mentioned that Moynihan resigned when he felt that he had lost the
                        confidence of the Secretary. My experience has been that when the Secretary
                        of State, Al Haig, lost the confidence of the representative to the UN,
                        Jeane Kirkpatrick, he resigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let's move to your next assignment. After two years in IO you moved over to the
                    Environmental Protection Agency. What was your status there?</p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I had a friend in the Foreign Service who had worked in the
                    Office of International Activities in EPA and really enjoyed the work. I was
                    looking for one more assignment in Washington before I went abroad and thought
                    that it might be interesting and worthwhile to work in the environmental field.
                    I had always supported environmental protection goals in the United States as
                    many Americans did back then. In fact, it was hard to find anyone who did not
                    support environmental protection in earlier days and we should recall that it
                    was frequently under the Republicans that much of our environmental progress was
                    made. Under President Nixon EPA was created and other environmental
                    organizations in the early '70s. So, it wasn't that old or established a field
                    when I went to EPA. There was a staff in EPA' international office of
                    approximately 20-25 professionals dealing with various aspects of international
                    environmental cooperation. I came to that two year assignment determined to see
                    what I could do and learn more about the environmental field. I had a very
                    productive two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of things did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was hired to take over bilateral issues with Canada and Mexico,
                    and to some extent with a few other countries that we dealt with. Canada at that
                    time was accusing the United States of poisoning the Great Lakes. We, of course,
                    felt that we had a higher degree of environmental protection on our industry
                    than did Canada. But, there were many arguments. On the Mexican side it was much
                    as it still is today, that is the Mexicans claim that they cannot afford or did
                    not have the enforcement capacity to put controls on industry, particularly
                    along the border with the United States, along the Rio Grande. We had programs
                    to develop cooperation with the Mexicans and with Canada.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>One of the issues, as I indicated, was the water quality of the Great Lakes. With
                    the State Department and other agencies in Washington we developed a team of
                    negotiators to work out an agreement on Great Lakes water quality, getting.
                    commitments by both sides to end discharging pollutants into the Great Lakes and
                    to try to rehabilitate areas that had been polluted on both sides.</p>
                <p>The other main issue we had with Canada was air quality. There were some
                    agreements for particular areas where there had been some deterioration of air
                    quality such as in the Detroit airshed with Windsor Canada and in the Pacific
                    Northwest, but no overall agreement. As a result of initial efforts that we
                    undertook when I was there, we eventually developed an agreement many years
                    later to reduce the level of acid rain and its pollutants which came from sulfur
                    dioxide primarily, to put more controls on both US and Canadian coal fired power
                    plants and steel plants, etc., so that the level of acid rain in both countries
                    have diminished considerably.</p>
                <p>On the Mexican side we were almost starting from scratch. We had a huge problem
                    of pollution from Tijuana into the Pacific Ocean which contaminated beaches in
                    San Diego and areas on both sides. One of the big projects that the U.S. started
                    was to build a sewage treatment plant to treat municipal sewage from Mexico as
                    well as California, so that both cities (San Diego and Tijuana) would have at
                    least primary and secondary treatment of municipal wastes. That was one big
                    agreement and there were others that have been achieved since then with Mexico
                    and with Canada. By the way, the municipal treatment project is still being
                    built as we speak (in 1997).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the agreements were finally achieved, did you work on
                        legislation that would implement these treaties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That is a good question. Of course we didn't make any commitments
                    that we were not authorized to make in legislation. But, the fact is we were
                    ahead of both countries in having legislation on the books, so we were able to
                    basically work in tandem with legislation that was being passed or had already
                    been passed by the Congress and signed into law, to form the US commitment and
                    then try and get both Canada and Mexico to undertake similar legislative
                    initiatives so that they could enforce their sides of the agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We definitely were in the lead on the legislative side at
                        that point. Did you work closely with Congress on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, we kept specific committees or subcommittees and individual
                    members of congress briefed on what we were doing and frequently we were asked
                    to brief. For example, Congressman Oberstar of Minnesota who was very much
                    concerned about the pollution in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of northern
                    Minnesota on measures we were taking to prevent pollution in that particular
                    area. We also briefed congressmen and senators from other border states, such as
                    Maine, Vermont and also from the Pacific northwest and Texas, to make sure we
                    were in tune with what they would like to see happening in their particular
                    states and trans-boundary areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle being a State Department person in
                        another agency with probably some inevitable conflicts with the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That was an interesting aspect of my work. I developed fairly
                    close and productive relationships with the Mexico desk and with the Canadian
                    affairs office in State. I even attended the staff meetings of the Canadian
                    affairs office, headed by the deputy assistant secretary, Richard Vine, at the
                    time. His weekly meetings I attended so that we would always be more or less in
                    touch with each other. There were a few conflicts but primarily they were
                    conflicts of control. State wanted control and EPA would have liked to have
                    taken over many of the negotiating functions that State had held tightly onto.
                    Of course, being in the Environmental Protection Agency I could see the merits
                    of EPA's arguments but very little ground was given by State during my tenure in
                    EPA. For the most part we worked very harmoniously together. On the Great Lakes
                    Water Quality Agreement, for example, the deputy administrator of EPA, Barbara
                    Blum, wanted to head the US delegation to Ottawa to sign the agreement, but
                    Secretary of State Cyrus Vance was the one who actually signed the agreement. He
                    did not make a speech, but I drafted remarks for Ms. Blum so that she would be
                    able to deliver a speech on behalf of EPA at the meeting and everything worked
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your colleagues at EPA view you? Were you an
                        outsider with questionable loyalty to the organization? How did you handle
                        that part of the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was amazing how easily they accepted me and others from State.
                    There were two other officers from the State Department at the same time working
                    on other issues, primarily multilateral ones dealing with the OECD and a
                    bilateral agreement with Russia. But, the technical offices of EPA, the offices
                    of water, air, toxic substances, wastes, they were all very practical minded
                    people and we worked very smoothly together. I found very little conflict, very
                    little suspicion. Most of those officers had people who were interested in
                    international cooperation, very dedicated people. They also enjoyed the
                    negotiating sessions and the trips to Canada and to Mexico.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your evaluation of exchange assignments for you
                        personally and as a general rule for the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Some officers in the State Department eschewed assignments to
                    other agencies feeling that they were not the kind of jobs that would help them
                    earn promotions and advance in the Foreign Service. As a matter of fact I was
                    promoted very shortly after my two year detail to EPA and I felt like I got more
                    experience actually negotiating agreements in EPA than I had up to that time
                    working in the State Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: A very good experience for me. It helped to prepare me and
                    qualify me for a job in environmental affairs later on in the OES bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings us up to 1979 and then you go to Ankara. You
                        haven't had Turkish language at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, I hadn't so I took a ten-month intensive Turkish training
                    course at the Foreign Service Institute. When I left EPA in 1979 I spent almost
                    a year in preparation for my assignment to Turkey from 1980-83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that assignment come about? Was it a bidding
                        situation or did someone approach you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Up to this time I hadn't focused a lot on my career or careerism
                    issues, but I needed to go overseas by this time, having been in the States
                    since 1973. How I got the job in Turkey was that the incumbent in the job in the
                    political section in Ankara, Robert Peck, had to leave a year early because he
                    was under a security threat. So, the job came open a little bit off cycle and
                    through contact with somebody in the Bureau of Personnel, I was able to put my
                    bid in for this assignment and it happened very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about the Turkish language
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was an excellent language program. The language programs and
                    area studies were integrated into the same time frame so one day a week out of
                    the five workdays was devoted to area studies and the other four days to
                    language training. I ended up after the ten months with a 3+/3 in Turkish and
                    with a pretty good grounding and updating in American/Turkish and regional
                    affairs. So, I am very high on the training at FSI.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your previous language help you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I had a smattering of Turkish when I was in Istanbul as a junior
                    officer but had forgotten much of it. I had never really mastered the grammar
                    very well. Turkish has a rather convoluted grammar by our standards so it took
                    some effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't the normal Turkish program longer than ten
                        months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, that was the normal time and I believe it still is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I arrived in July, 1980, about two months before the military
                    takeover in Turkey. At that time there was considerable anarchy between leftist
                    and rightist groups in Turkey. You were country director at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The most frequent clashes and terrorist incidents between the
                    extreme left and right were taking place primarily in Istanbul and the larger
                    cities, but also in some of the cities where there were Sunni and Shia
                    populations living together. Ankara was not so bedeviled by these incidents,
                    although there were some shootings and bombings. There were frequent
                    demonstrations and the general atmosphere was one of instability when my family
                    and I arrived, so we were wondering what we were getting into.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular job in the political section in
                        Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was the number two in the political section to Dan Newberry,
                    who later became consul general in Istanbul. For a while I was acting political
                    counselor, but we had a replacement for Newberry who came from the Arab world,
                    Mr. Jay Freres.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people were there in the section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had a rather large political section which included the
                    political/military people. About the time I arrived, political-military affairs
                    became a separate section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, as the number two in the section, did you have a
                        specific area or were you a real deputy and were across the board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: My primary work when I was assigned for those three years was
                    domestic political issues, but much of the time I was asked to supervise other
                    officers, including two junior officers. You ask the number, as I recall now we
                    had a total of seven when I was there: two junior officers, one under me who did
                    international issues and foreign policy issues, and the other one did primarily
                    domestic issues. So, we had a rather well staffed section with two Foreign
                    Service National employees who supported us. We also had a labor reporting
                    officer in our section and a labor reporting Foreign Service National, so we had
                    three FSNs assigned to our section as well as seven officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the living conditions like and how did the
                        security situation affect you and your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I arrived with my wife, who had never been overseas with me, as I
                    had recently remarried, and two stepchildren. They didn't know what they were
                    getting into. So, I concentrated a great deal in getting my family settled in,
                    as all Foreign Service officers do, and getting them set up in schools. Things
                    went very smoothly. Ankara did not seem to be as affected by the political
                    terrorism that was going on, which wasn't in any case particularly aimed at the
                    United States, although the US was under a lot of rhetorical attacks by the
                    left. However, I mentioned earlier that one of our officers, the one I replaced,
                    had been under a possible terrorist threat, so Americans were not exempt. There
                    was an American military officer who had been shot in Istanbul several months
                    before I arrived. So, we were on our guard, were well briefed on security
                    matters. We were a little bit fearful I have to admit coming into the situation.
                    US and Turkish military cooperation continued as it had for many years earlier.
                    However, we had only recently gone through the period where much of the military
                    cooperation had stopped, because of the embargo that we placed on Turkey as a
                    result of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974. This was 1980 and we had just
                    entered into a new agreement to lift the embargo and reopen the Turkish/American
                    bases under Turkish sovereignty and to resume military assistance. I believe you
                    were in large part responsible for that being restarted, getting Congress to go
                    along with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very interesting period with the clear
                        requirement to have a good relationship with Turkey because of NATO reasons
                        and the problems that were occasioned by the Cyprus problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Because this military cooperation had resumed, the left in Turkey
                    was very incensed, wanting Turkey to be neutral or even handed between Moscow
                    and Washington, this was precisely the reason that Americans were living under
                    something of a cloud in Turkey.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: As I mentioned things went smoother than we might have imagined
                    and only two months after we arrived the Turkish military took over the reins of
                    government, crushed at least temporarily the left, arrested many people and
                    terrorism was effectively ended. It was the most tranquil period that one could
                    imagine in terms of living in that country during that period. I might also
                    mention that the Turkish military intervention and takeover of the government on
                    September 12, 1980 was one of the most popular military coups I have ever heard
                    of. People were absolutely celebrating this event because they had been afraid
                    to go out of their houses and apartments at night due to the near anarchy. Even
                    in Ankara, where I lived, night life was virtually non-existent and restaurants
                    had suffered tremendously because people were afraid of street attacks,
                    demonstrations or things that might threaten them. So, they celebrated as soon
                    as the military curfew ended a day or two after the coup by going out, filling
                    all the restaurants, night clubs, tea houses, etc. all over the country. It was
                    a tremendous sight to see and experience to have to see how popular a military
                    regime could be.</p>

                        there are occasion that you can see that the people are willing to accept
                        for some reason a different kind of power structure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The Turkish military kept their promises. They occupied
                    government for a little over three years and that is about all. They turned the
                    government over to civilian control and held elections after developing a new
                    constitution and a little bit more muscular administration than had existed
                    before. The problem had been that the main two parties in Turkey had developed
                    such an antipathy towards each other that they were unable to cooperate and
                    gridlock occurred in the government and when there was no governmental solution
                    to the problems of the country, the military took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your time working on domestic issues must have been very
                        interesting during that time. What were the main trends besides what you
                        have just said?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: After the military takeover, the job became more difficult
                    because there were no politics per se. There was no parliamentary politics, only
                    the politics of the Turkish bureaucracy and their military masters existed so
                    that our job was made considerably more difficult because our contacts with the
                    military were limited to military cooperation. The generals did not confide in
                    us on their intentions and progress in reforming the political side of the
                    equation, so we were somewhat hampered in our reporting. However, as in many
                    countries, it doesn't take long for politics to reassert itself and many of the
                    former politicians and through family ties, etc., and through the connections
                    that we had in the bureaucracy we were able to get a much better sense of how
                    things were going and we were also able to access some of the decision making
                    centers in the military, so that we had a pretty good handle on what they were
                    doing and in what direction they were heading. In foreign policy, the Foreign
                    Office never ceased to operate and with the same people basically. The Foreign
                    Minister, Ilter Turkmen, was a career Turkish diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned before when we were talking about Kabul that
                        you were in with the people all the time, did you notice a difference in
                        being a junior political officer and a senior political officer, or did you
                        do the same kind of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Inevitably there were some differences, in part due to my own age
                    and my position. The two societies, the one in Afghanistan and the one I
                    encountered in Turkey, were quite different in many ways. The level of education
                    of Turks was considerably higher. I would say that there was a broader array of
                    Turks that I could deal with and I did a considerable amount of traveling within
                    the country as political officer in Ankara. We were expected to travel all over
                    the area that we supervised, our consular district, and also traveled to other
                    consular districts either while on vacation or while working to talk to people
                    and decision makers. For example, I went to Istanbul a number of times. I had
                    been there before and knew a number of people there and had many Turkish
                    friends. Many of the people I dealt with initially when I arrived were
                    journalists because they were the ones who would be the most talkative and the
                    most interested in sharing information, so I made friends with quite a few
                    Turkish journalists, and some of those were in Istanbul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were able to keep those relations up even while you
                        were in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of the Turkish press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very unbridled and sometimes undisciplined, but very competent
                    too. There are quite a number of Turkish newspapers, very colorful printing in
                    Technicolor all over the front pages and other sections of their newspapers.
                    They vary in degree of responsibility from scurrilously yellow journalism to
                    fairly responsible reporting. One of the newspapers that we thought was the best
                    was a former leftist paper which became much more centrist after the military
                    took over, that's Cumhuriyet, the newspaper published out of Istanbul which was
                    the least colorful, more like the New York Times in appearance than the Daily
                    News. Its journalists were quite well-educated, competent and responsible. As I
                    say their politics shifted somewhat to the center of the political spectrum
                    after the military takeover. Their diplomatic reporter in Ankara and I became
                    very good friends. I believe he is still working as a journalist in Turkey. Some
                    of the other foreign affairs correspondents who were either in Ankara or
                    Istanbul or traveled a good bit were people that I liked to talk to from time to
                    time. We developed relationships where they would not ask me certain things or
                    expect me to give them certain information but were able to share some insights
                    with me on domestic issues where presumably I was less well plugged in than they
                    and I would be able to give them more insights on US foreign policy or official
                    bilateral relations with Turkey, areas that I was able to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the big policy issues, at least for the United
                        States, if not for Turkey itself, was its relationship with Greece. What was
                        that like during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: After the military takeover things were fairly quiet with Greece.
                    It was clear that the Turkish generals did not want any confrontation with
                    Greece or to take any new initiatives on Cyprus or anything that would upset
                    Turkish-Greek relations while they were reforming the domestic politics of
                    Turkey. There were, of course, the same issues between Greece and Turkey on
                    Cyprus and the disputes over the Aegean and whether or not the Aegean zones of
                    economic activity were Greek or Turkish, depending on whether you were talking
                    about extending out from the mainland or from Greek islands. The Greeks wanted
                    to insist that each island had its own territorial sea and exclusive economic
                    zone. The finishing touches were put on the Law of the Sea in 1981 and as it
                    turned out because of the Reagan Administration''s concerns about sharing of the
                    economic wealth of the sea did not subscribe to all of the Law of the Sea
                    agreement's provisions. As a result we found ourselves very much in harmony with
                    Turkish policy, which was also not to sign the Law of the Sea agreement because
                    of their reservations about Greek claims and islands having the right to claim
                    not only territorial seas but economic zones. That was one of the issues that
                    animated Greek/Turkish relations while I was there. But, there were no hot
                    disputes in the Aegean as occurred recently where some Turks occupied a small
                    island right off the coast of Turkey that the Greeks claimed was theirs.
                    Incidents like that were fairly minimal. Cyprus was the main issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was our relationship with the Turks in Turkey about
                        Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We were primarily trying in Ankara to promote a flexible approach
                    by the Turkish Cypriots and by Turkey to resolve the Cyprus problem. We had a
                    special mediator, Reg Bartholomew at the time, who was trying to see if there
                    was a basis for a settlement in Cyprus and we are still trying almost 16 years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we have more mediators.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We have had a parade of mediators since then and we have one
                    right now, a presidential envoy, Mr. Beattie...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Special Cyprus Coordinator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: And the Special Cyprus Coordinator, Ambassador Williams, who
                    worked for you I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that is right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: In any case, because we had a special mediator we did not play a
                    leading role in trying to hammer out terms of reference or positions on Cyprus,
                    although we were asked to make demarches from time to time to the Foreign
                    Ministry. One of the foreign policy issues I dealt with was this one when I was
                    acting political counselor and I got to know the Cyprus director in the Foreign
                    Ministry quite well. He genuinely seemed interested in an agreement on Cyprus,
                    but, of course, toed the Turkish nationalistic line which was that there had to
                    be a bizonal confederation style of government before Turkey and the Turkish
                    Cypriots would agree to settle and before Turkish troops would even think about
                    evacuating from Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of pressure did the Turks impose on us? Did they
                        feel we were pro-Greek Cypriot in this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think the Turks were relatively satisfied with our posture
                    which was that we wanted an agreement that everybody could live with and that we
                    were not putting undue pressure on them. You have to remember that at this time
                    in the early '80s we were trying to build up Turkey defensively, enhance our
                    security relations, increase the amount of our military assistance and economic
                    assistance as well during these early Reagan years. Turkey was a big part of our
                    strategy to try and develop a stronger military posture vis-a-vis the Soviet
                    Union which only a year or two earlier had invaded Afghanistan and had made
                    other moves which were interpreted by the Administration as being a bit too
                    bellicose for comfort. So, Turkey being a big part of our strategy was not under
                    strong US pressure to make settlements on other issues such as Cyprus even
                    though we recognized this as an important issue and one that we wanted to see
                    resolved because the issue was basically between two NATO members. But the Turks
                    did pressure us or did feel that we were being unfair to them by providing
                    military assistance to them on a ratio with Greece, the famous 7 to 10 ratio,
                    which I am sure you are very familiar with having been director of Turkish/Greek
                    and Cypriot affairs at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is right. The 7 to 10, which still exists by the way,
                        is ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: This is Senator Sarbanes' legacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, it still is in effect. Another sensitive
                        issue that has some impact on domestic politics in the United States is the
                        Armenian question, the suggestion of all the terrible things the Turks did
                        in World War I. During this time there were attacks on Turkish diplomats in
                        the United States as well as elsewhere. How did that impact on your work in
                        Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: This was a very sensitive issue, as you know, for the Turks and
                    the Turkish government. One of their major foreign policy efforts was to try and
                    gain support for their view that Turkey should not be brought before the court
                    of world opinion or be forced to suffer by attacks on their diplomats because of
                    something that happened during the Ottoman Empire right in the period before
                    World War I and during World War I. The Turks were very emphatic to us in Ankara
                    during my time there that they didn't want the Holocaust Museum, which was being
                    constructed in Washington, to deal with the alleged Turkish massacre or Turkish
                    genocide against Armenians in eastern Turkey during this period of 1915-19. They
                    felt so strongly about this that the ambassador and others were frequently
                    called to the Foreign Ministry or the Turkish embassy in Washington went in to
                    see you and others in the State Department to try and insure that the United
                    States did not join in this Armenian publicity campaign to force the Turks
                    either to admit that they had committed genocide or for reparations, or for
                    whatever. I know that many Turks felt at the time I was there that although
                    atrocities may have been committed they genuinely felt that Turkey had been
                    stabbed in the back by the Armenians at a time when they were about to go under
                    as a nation state and that atrocities were also committed against Turks in
                    eastern Turkey.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was something they felt very strongly about and was
                        murky at best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very much so. Of course, we were also witnessing in 1981-82 the
                    beginning of a campaign against Kurdish extremists, which is a contemporary
                    issue of alleged Turkish atrocities against civilian populations in southeastern
                    Turkey. These are very difficult issues that the Turks have been dealing with
                    for a long time. However, it should be noted that there are many Kurdish ethnic
                    Turks living all over Turkey, they don't just live in the southeast. Many of
                    them migrated for jobs and a better way of life out of eastern Turkey into the
                    big cities and into the western parts of Turkey. Many of them would like to see
                    the problem of Kurdish separatism go away so that they can get on with their
                    lives. But, the Turks have never taken kindly to efforts by Kurds to have a
                    measure of autonomy or even to be able to use their own language in the schools,
                    etc. The Turks, since the time of Ataturk, have sought to build the country
                    around the idea of Turkish ethnic language, institutions and to downplay
                    separatism. Of course, this is a problem that exists in many other countries
                    since the end of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Changing the subject slightly, were there any notable
                        visits by senior Americans during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We had numerous visits by State Department officials. We had a
                    visit by Secretary Alexander Haig during my time there. The emphasis was very
                    much on building the bilateral relationship for purposes of NATO solidarity and
                    solidarity against the Soviet Union. We did not have a presidential or vice
                    presidential visit during my time, although we have had subsequently. Part of
                    the reason for this, perhaps was that during almost my whole time there Turkey
                    was under a military regime and I think it was felt that it would be better to
                    send officials at more of a working level, although the Secretary of State visit
                    is not considered just a working level visit and the Turks were very receptive,
                    of course, to just about any official attention from Washington, including the
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador and are there any anecdotes about
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: When I arrived Jim Spain was ambassador. However, his tenure was
                    cut short by the election of President Reagan and the assignment of Robert
                    Strausz-Hup� as ambassador shortly after the Reagan Administration took office.
                    Ambassador Strausz-Hup� was focused on the strategic picture, the big picture
                    most of the time and on enhancing the value of the Turks and the Turkish

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Arnie's interview but I must tell one anecdote and
                        that was while I was the director of the office for southern European
                        affairs, I actually stayed with Ambassador Strausz-Hup� one time and he was
                        a rather elderly man at that time, at least in his late '70s and he still
                        played tennis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Early '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I became his doubles partner and found that he really was
                        still pretty good but did not move much. He took one corner of the court and
                        I was expected to cover all the rest. Your labor attach� was his usual
                        partner, but he really enjoyed that day I took his place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: He made you run around a good bit. I used to play with the
                    ambassador. He would have his staff assistant ask around the embassy for people
                    who would like to play. Some people preferred to be busy but others felt that
                    they ought to take advantage of this invitation. So, occasionally we would play.
                    We learned that if we were going to hit the ball to the ambassador's side of the
                    court to try to hit it to him, and he did a pretty good job. He retrieved a few
                    balls that were not close to him, but as you said, generally he was fairly
                    stationary on his side of the court and expected his partner to make up a lot
                    more ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I am like that at 80 I will be very happy. Okay, we are
                        into 1983 and time for another assignment. What happened to you next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I was interested in having my own show, if possible and there
                    were a number of principal officer jobs on the bid list in 1983 when I was
                    looking for a new job. I had been on home leave the year before I submitted my
                    bid and talked to my personnel counselor. He looked at my record, at my previous
                    assignments and felt that I was qualified for such a job. He encouraged me to
                    bid on the job in Lahore as consul general, which I did. I found out later that
                    there were 46 others who had bid on that job, a big surprise to me, I had no
                    idea that many people would bid on the job. About 20 were viable bidders, at
                    grade and with the right amount of experience that was wanted for that job. So,
                    I was very lucky to get the job and I owe it all to my personnel counselor and
                    some friends in the Near East Bureau, including the late Arnie Raphel, who was
                    deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs. So, getting a principal
                    officer job or an ambassadorship takes a lot of groundwork and preparation even
                    though all of the assignments are supposedly made on the basis of open
                    assignments and purely on merit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in this case it appears that merit had some impact
                        on the situation because clearly you were qualified both by language ability
                        and experience in the region, etc. So, it sounds to me it was more than
                        luck.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, thank you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to refresh your language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: This was not a language designated position. Urdu being the
                    language of Pakistan was not deemed to be essential because Pakistan had been
                    part of British India and most educated Pakistanis spoke English. But, as soon
                    as I arrived in Lahore I began studying Urdu because I wanted to be able to
                    interact with those people who did not speak English. I spent an hour every day
                    of my whole three years there in the morning before I went to work studying
                    Urdu. It is a difficult language but there are a lot of Turkish words in Urdu
                    because Urdu is a made-up language. It is a combination of Hindi and the
                    language spoken in the military camps, Urdu being the Turkish word meaning army.
                    It was the language of the army back during the Mughal period when they hired
                    many mercenaries, some of whom came from Turkey and they used Turkish officers
                    to man their armies. So, that is how the language arose. Much of it is Sanskrit
                    or Hindi origin but there are many homonyms in Turkish in Urdu. So, that helped
                    me a little bit on the vocabulary side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about those old one hour language
                        programs that are being phased out a bit? I had it in Japanese and found it
                        was quite useful. Do you share that view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think that it is unfortunate if they have been curtailed. I
                    wasn't aware of that. I think they are absolutely vital to enable one to have at
                    least a polite command of the language which can be very important and useful
                    for any officer, not just an ambassador, political officer, consul general, but
                    for everybody at a post including secretaries. I think the program should be
                    restored as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How proficient did you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I could bargain for carpets, could speak a few words at
                    gatherings when asked to say a few words, especially at gatherings where people
                    were not as well educated as most Pakistanis. I can't say I was able to speak in
                    complex sentences or deal with complicated issues, but I certainly was applauded
                    by many of the people I dealt with for having taken the trouble to learn some of
                    their language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the personal side, you mentioned the situation when you
                        and your family arrived in Ankara and the tensions of the period, what was
                        Lahore like in that regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Lahore was one of three constituent posts, the other two being
                    Karachi and Peshawar, working under the direction of the embassy in Islamabad.
                    This period, 1983-86, was the height of the effort by the United States to
                    support the Afghan mujahideen against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.
                    Even in Lahore which is somewhat removed from the frontier with Afghanistan we
                    could feel the impact of our policy which was to use Pakistan as the conduit for
                    our aiding the mujahideen and in order to secure that cooperation by bringing
                    more economic and military support to the government and people of Pakistan. So
                    when I arrived in Lahore we had a very small consulate staff of eight people,
                    plus two Drug Enforcement Agency agents, one AID liaison officer and three USIS
                    officers. We had a rather large cultural program because Lahore is the cultural
                    capital of Pakistan. We went from those numbers which I believe totaled 13 or
                    14, to almost 50 Americans as a result of the increase of our AID program in
                    Pakistan. We had a number of projects that were just on the drawing boards when
                    I arrived and were beginning to come to fruition by bringing in many, many AID
                    contractors. They were not direct hire AID personnel, but contractors working on
                    electrical power, health and a few other programs. So, I became responsible for
                    the welfare and the security...we did have some security problems in
                    Pakistan...of over 50 Americans before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your own family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: This was a post where one's family could accompany, so my own
                    family came with me. My stepson had graduated but my stepdaughter was still with
                    us and went to the American School in Lahore. We had a very fine American School
                    with a number of third country national students but two-thirds of the students
                    were children of the highly educated Pakistanis who wanted their children to
                    study in American schools and eventually go to American universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>As I mentioned we did have a security threat there. The government was headed by
                    the martial law administration, another military government for me, of President
                    Zia ul-Haq. He had his opponents in the country and some were imprisoned. There
                    was a terrorist group named Al Zulfikar, named after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the
                    previous prime minister who had been ousted and later executed. The Al Zulfikar
                    group was looking for a way to embarrass or assassinate either Pakistani
                    government officials or their primary supporters, which was the United States.
                    Shortly after I arrived we discovered that the Al Zulfikar group had targeted me
                    for assassination. At that time we did not have a high degree of security at the
                    office building, the consulate, and only a nominal guard at the gate of my
                    residence. We learned that there was to have been an attempt by three Pakistanis
                    who supported this terrorist group, armed with guns, hand grenades and other
                    weapons, and that they had been discovered only the night before they were to
                    make the hit. Two were arrested and one escaped. As soon as this was learned by
                    friends of the consulate, I was asked to leave the country for a couple of weeks
                    until an armored car could be sent to me from the United States and better
                    security arrangements made. It being nearly Christmas holiday season, I went on
                    a two-week Christmas holiday and when I came back we had a fully armored car and
                    I felt much safer. We also for a while had a chase car by the Punjab security
                    force which was cooperating with us for a couple of months until we felt the
                    situation was safer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was a fairly tense time for you and your
                        family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, I thought here we go again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And even disconcerting when you are the target?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. I think they viewed the American consul general as the
                    easiest of several targets that they had under consideration. One of them was a
                    cousin of the President who lived in Lahore and another was the Governor of the
                    Punjab who was an ex-military general. They felt that my security was the
                    easiest to penetrate but fortunately the plot was discovered in the nick of
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the benefit of those who don't know exactly where
                        Lahore is in location within the country...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, Lahore is the capital of Punjab province which is the most
                    populous province of the country, over 60 million people, and is located only
                    about 17 miles from the Indian border, from Indian Punjab. During the partition
                    of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Punjab was divided up as well as part of
                    Kashmir up in northern Pakistan between India and Pakistan. It was where the
                    fighting basically ended. There is a river, one of the five rivers of the Punjab
                    that demarcates part of the border between Pakistan and India. So, Lahore is
                    situated in that area, about 220 miles south of Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there regional political problems bringing domestic
                        political reporting into play once again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, Punjabi politics dominated the national politics then as
                    well as today. Since there was a military government in power, they seem to
                    follow me around, much of the politics was taking place in the provinces and the
                    embassy very much relied on the reporting that they had from Consulate General
                    Lahore to provide an idea of what the politics were at any given time. Shortly
                    after I arrived the first elections were held. They were non party elections for
                    an advisory assembly which was deemed to be partly a show by the military
                    government and not a fully free election, although it was a fairly highly
                    contested and as far as we could see a free election. So, politics began to get
                    active while I was there and I was acquainted with most of the major players in
                    Punjab. Of course, there were a number of major players also from Sindh province
                    and its capital, Karachi. My deputy and political officer and I were privileged
                    in Lahore to be acquainted with many of the movers and shakers as politics
                    resumed in Pakistan, including the current Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that consulates can play a unique role in
                        political reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Definitely, and I believe that is why we haven't closed any posts
                    in Pakistan because of the unsettled nature of politics in that region, the
                    instability, the problems between India and Pakistan, the problem of nuclear
                    proliferation, the unsettled situation in Afghanistan. When instabilities rear
                    their head in a country it is very important to have constituent posts. I think
                    that is one reason why we have perhaps retired more consular posts in Europe
                    where politics are more settled than we have in some third world countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other thoughts or anecdotes about the Lahore
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, I would like to say one thing about the role of consulates
                    in promoting American business and trade. It is often alleged that the State
                    Department has been derelict in its duty, at least in the past, to promote
                    American business. I think that is a bum rap that, as far as I know, never
                    existed even back in the '60s when I first started out in the Foreign Service in
                    Turkey. We paid a lot of attention to trade promotion and the American business
                    community in helping them to find markets and investment opportunities and that
                    sort of thing. We made a major push when I was in Lahore, which is second only
                    to Karachi in the amount of business that was being done. Plus we had the
                    electrical power authority located in Lahore which let many contracts and had a
                    number of American firms bidding on contracts during my time there. One of the
                    things I did was to help lobby on behalf of American firms, to promote the
                    selection of American firms to supply goods and services for contracts let by
                    the government or in some cases private joint ventures. I do remember helping
                    the Cargill Corporation, a major agribusiness company in the United States,
                    based in Minnesota, to set up some of its first joint ventures in
                    agribusiness—One an orange juice concentrate business in my consular district, a
                    livestock feed business and a seed production business in the country. There
                    were other companies as well. I calculated that before I left during my three
                    years that we had at least helped and supported several hundred million dollars
                    worth of business for American firms, either trade, investment or contracts on
                    projects in the country. I felt that this was one of my major contributions to
                    the furtherance of US interests in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Calls to mind the recent article by Thomas Littmann in the
                        “Washington Post” about the decline of resources for foreign affairs. Did

                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I did and I think it was a very timely piece and pointed out that
                    there is a price to be paid for hollowing the Foreign Service, especially the
                    State Department which does a lot of valuable work for the United States not
                    only in the political, security areas, but also in the economic/commercial
                    field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the relations between Pakistan and India during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Relations were on the whole poor but they did not deteriorate
                    seriously during my three years there. India, of course, did not support our
                    effort to oust the Russians from Afghanistan and was very concerned that
                    Pakistan was building up its military capacity through United States military
                    assistance, primarily providing the F-16 aircraft to Pakistan while I was there.
                    So India was watching this with growing concern. There were, however, during
                    this time two years when there was a military buildup along the border very
                    close to Lahore on the Indian side which the Indians attributed to their annual
                    exercises during the dry season in the Punjab. Tensions mounted twice during
                    this period and I was lucky to be close enough to the border to view some of the
                    buildup on the Pakistani side. We took off the Muslim Sabbath, Friday, and
                    Saturday at that time as our weekend. I used to go horseback riding on Fridays
                    outside of Lahore in an area not too far from the border and was able to see the
                    Pakistani tanks and artillery deployed along the border. It always looked a
                    little bit threatening to see these tanks camouflaged and dug in as though they
                    were ready to repel an invasion or maybe even start one of their own. So, I was
                    able to report on what I was able to see along the border. Fortunately nothing
                    ever broke out that threatened the peace between the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an Indian consulate general in Lahore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes there was. It was very closely regulated by Pakistan and
                    limited to facilitating visits by Indian nationals to Sikh shrines which are
                    located in Lahore. There was no political presence per se.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any relations with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oh, yes. There were some consular agents of other countries in
                    Lahore. There was an Iranian mission, a British Council, a German consular agent
                    and an Italian agent. There wasn't a large consular presence in Lahore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any use at all in there being a consular
                        corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Definitely. We kept in close touch and traded war stories and
                    obtained information about what was going on within the government from our
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your previous experience in Afghanistan come into
                        play?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I did not participate in the US effort, except very indirectly,
                    to build up Pakistan and the effort against the Russians. However, there was an
                    Afghan refugee camp in Punjab which I visited twice and was able to talk to some
                    of the refugees and express our concerns and find out what problems existed, and
                    talk to some of the voluntary agencies that were helping the refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relationship with the embassy and your
                        ambassador and the general relationship of constituent post to an
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: When I arrived Ron Spiers was the ambassador but he left after a
                    couple of months and was replace by Deane Hinton. Deane Hinton, career
                    ambassador, made it clear when he came that he wanted the constituent posts to
                    be free to report their political and economic developments directly without
                    being filtered through the embassy. At the same time, he wanted to keep in close
                    touch himself personally with all of the constituent posts, which he visited
                    frequently. On a monthly basis I usually attended country team meetings in
                    Islamabad. So, we were very well clued in and plugged in to the embassy. At the
                    same time we had considerable freedom to do our political and economic reporting
                    as we saw fit and in accordance with our own reporting plan. So, it was the best
                    of both worlds really. We had good coordination with the embassy but a lot of
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any direct relationship with any of the
                        individual sections within the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. We made sure that the political and economic counselors and
                    their staffs were welcome to visit us and travel with us in the province so that
                    they could see for themselves and get a better sense of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very much so. The political counselor, John Wolf, made a number
                    of visits with me around the province as well as some of his officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the military attach�s? Did you have a
                        relationship with them or did you have your own military presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, we didn't have a military presence. We had one of the major
                    units of the army in the Lahore cantonment and we did have a visit once or twice
                    by the Defense or Army attach�, but I think they were restricted from official
                    contact outside of the capital, which was unfortunate. Occasionally I made calls
                    directly on the military commander in Lahore as well as many calls on the
                    governor, who was a just retired Lt. General, so I had a pretty good sense of
                    what was going on with the military personally and kept our military colleagues
                    at the embassy informed about what I knew was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other final thoughts about Lahore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: One of the best assignments I had in the Foreign Service, if not
                    the best, at least in the overseas setting. I thought it was an exciting time.
                    Aside from the security problem that I had early on, I felt that I was well
                    plugged in to the country and to its leaders, including even the president who
                    came down to Lahore frequently and some of the ministers. It was a very
                    productive assignment and one that got me promoted into the Senior Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good thing in itself. You were there for three years and
                        in 1986 moving on to Rabat. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It happened through the bidding process and a little bit of
                    lobbying on my part. My family seemed interested in going to Morocco. The job
                    attracted me. It was not necessarily a move up but it was a good substantive job
                    being political counselor in another Muslim country. I had the French language
                    necessary for the job, although I didn't have Arabic which would have been
                    equally if not more helpful in some settings. I heard after I arrived that the
                    ambassador had reservations about me because he felt having been a principal
                    officer I might consider it a bit of a comedown to be political counselor in his
                    embassy. I assured him when I arrived that I didn't consider it so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The ambassador was Tom Nassif, a political appointee who had been
                    a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs in the Department
                    before he took this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he there during most of your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Almost all of it except for the last seven months when he was
                    replaced by Michael Ussery, another political appointee. Morocco seems to get
                    political appointees or attract them. Apparently the King of Morocco, King
                    Hassan, likes to have ambassadors from the United States who are plugged into
                    the political apparatus in Washington, not necessarily professional
                    diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been a number of them and, of course, it is a
                        very pleasant place to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It is a very pleasant country, a very beautiful country. It is
                    very well set up for tourism, very tightly controlled, a little more orderly
                    than some countries, although they have had some very brief bouts of violence
                    and political instability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume this time the move was relatively easy and there
                        were not security problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We hardly had any major security concerns during my whole time
                    there, for a change. My wife and stepdaughter were with me again. Rabat had an
                    American School and ample opportunities for family recreation including riding,
                    which I had become very fond of after assignments in both Turkey and Pakistan.
                    One of my family's criteria for assignment was that there be access to stables
                    and riding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, living conditions in Rabat were pretty
                        comfortable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, they were very comfortable. Rabat is right on the Atlantic
                    coast and has a very pleasant climate. It has good facilities for tourism and
                    visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the relations like between the United States and
                        Morocco at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They were very close. We always have been close to the Moroccans
                    for their moderation in Middle East politics and support of accommodation with
                    Israel. King Hassan had made several moves in that direction, both before and
                    during my time there. We have, and still maintain, a small military assistance
                    program, primarily training of Moroccan officers in the United States. There was
                    some talk of expanding military cooperation with Morocco while I was there but
                    for one reason or another it did not change greatly during my three years
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in charge of all aspects of political
                        reporting—domestic and international?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any domestic politics in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, but quite different from the kind of domestic politics I was
                    used to seeing where it was more wide open and more openly contested democratic
                    politics. Morocco has and did have then an elected parliament, a liberal press,
                    although not nearly as free and uninhibited as I found in Turkey and Pakistan.
                    The politics are of a different order. The populace breaks down between the
                    have-nots versus the five percent elite that have thrown in their lot with the
                    king. So far, the have-nots have not challenged the elite. Basically the system
                    takes care of everybody; no one starves. In parliamentary debates there were
                    minor differences with the king about his policy vis-a-vis Israel and other
                    Middle East questions. But debates on domestic issues, such as the state budget,
                    were pretty tame. The big foreign policy issue for Morocco was the Western
                    Sahara and Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara which had been evacuated by
                    Spain much earlier and which Morocco was trying to settle on its own terms. That
                    is, through a UN sponsored referendum that would have no risk of voting in favor
                    of independence rather than union with Morocco. This had been challenged during
                    my time there by Algeria and the Saharan Polisario Front which was attacking
                    Moroccan positions in the Western Sahara. Western Sahara is a fairly large strip
                    of land south of Morocco proper which contains mineral deposits, primarily
                    phosphates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our position on the Western Sahara issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Our position was that we would like to see the problem settled by
                    a United Nations sponsored referendum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Moroccans like that idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: King Hassan had agreed in the early '80s to a referendum,
                    however, the dispute was always over who would be registered to vote. Morocco
                    claimed, of course, that many Saharans had left there for economic reasons for
                    Morocco proper for jobs and whatnot and should be allowed to return to exercise
                    their right to vote. The opposition, and the Algerian sponsored Polisario Front
                    felt that Morocco should not be able to register these large numbers of alleged
                    Saharans to vote in a referendum. That dispute is still outstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That was another concern of ours. We wanted to see Algeria and
                    Morocco talk to each other. When I arrived they were not doing much talking to
                    each other about their bilateral problems and about the Western Sahara dispute.
                    There were tensions from time to time. But there were proposed regional projects
                    such as a gas pipeline from Algeria that would go to Morocco. Morocco, not
                    having a lot of oil or gas deposits, could benefit by this. The pipeline would
                    go through Morocco in the north and Morocco, of course, could obtain supplies
                    from that pipeline. The pipeline would then transit the Strait of Gibraltar and
                    go via Spain into Europe. This project is one of those dreams that may take
                    many, many years to realize, if ever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is natural gas we are talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Primarily, at least for now we are talking about natural gas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the United States have any other economic interests in
                        Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We did not have a large stake in the economic field either
                    through investment or through trade. We have, as I mentioned, a small
                    development assistance program.</p>
                <p>Morocco, not having gas or oil, has turned to agriculture as its main export
                    income earner. Citrus and agricultural products, and cut flowers, which provide
                    a significant amount of income for Morocco, are exported to the European market.
                    Other agricultural products, such as fresh vegetables, which are produced in
                    Morocco during the winter in Europe have also found a niche in that market.</p>
                <p>The other major foreign exchange earner had been phosphates, but the market for
                    phosphates dropped considerably because Morocco tried to raise the prices too
                    high and it didn't work because there were other sources, namely in Jordan, to
                    fill the gap at a more reasonable price. So, that policy backfired on Morocco
                    and the industry was struggling during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Morocco fit in with the rest of Africa? I'm
                        thinking sub-Sahara. Any relationships at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: King Hassan prided himself on developing relations with many
                    sub-Saharan African leaders, including his immediate neighbor to the south,
                    Mauritania. Over many hundreds of years considerable trade and cultural
                    relationships had existed between Black Africa and Arab and Berber Morocco. King
                    Hassan promoted these relationships vigorously. He has also cultivated relations
                    with most of Francophone Africa, including Ivory Coast, Senegal and Zaire and
                    several other countries that have given Morocco a modest role in trying to
                    promote peace and development in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Morocco plays a positive role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, Morocco provides modest economic assistance to some
                    countries of both Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa. I am thinking here of
                    Mauritania, of Chad. Morocco has also flirted with Libya and we were always
                    concerned that those relationships be confined to the bare minimum. Morocco, in
                    an effort to gain support of its position on the Western Sahara, has tried to
                    assist some of those smaller Francophone African countries in development
                    projects. These are modest projects, as Morocco doesn't have a lot of resources
                    to play a large role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are Morocco's relationship with France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Generally good but sometime uneasy over perceived slights. For
                    example, Morocco had some problems with France over the treatment of North
                    African immigrants, Moroccan immigrants in France. There have been, from time to
                    time, feelings by Morocco that the French cultural penetration was overly strong
                    or not to the benefit of Morocco. But, those problems were more of the nature of
                    perceived slights than they were serious bilateral issues. I would say the most
                    serious problem was dealing with the Moroccan immigrants and France trying to
                    curb illegal immigration from North Africa much as we have tried to curb illegal
                    immigration from Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do the Moroccans try to play off the United States against
                        France? I wondered if there was any tension there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Not that one would notice or make too much of. During my time
                    Moroccans seemed to be turning more to the United States for education. More
                    Moroccans seemed to be learning English and wanting to be educated in the United
                    States, whereas prior to that most Moroccans got their higher education in
                    France. So, there seemed to be a tilt in the direction of the United States, but
                    not one that we consciously exploited at the expense of France.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other reflections on Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: One of the problems that Morocco is going to have to face is the
                    succession problem. Whenever you have a traditional monarchy and a very tight
                    rein on government and the levers of power, questions will arise as to the
                    fitness of the designated successor, in this case the crown prince. Many
                    educated Moroccans and even those with a very modest amount of education, feel
                    that a monarchy is really outdated at the end of the 20th century and believe
                    that there should be perhaps a constitutional monarchy, a reigning monarchy
                    rather than a ruling monarchy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there is any possibility of that
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes, and I think there is always the potential for instability to
                    rear its head in Morocco. There were incidents, from time to time, of students
                    or unemployed workers from the rural areas. There was a major riot in Fez while
                    I was there and just recently there was a riot in Tangier according to a press
                    report. So, there is a considerable undercurrent of tension and potential for
                    violence, especially if there is a succession situation in Morocco that could
                    cause a terrific amount of instability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old is the king?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The king is in his late '60s now, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the crown prince?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The crown prince is in his early '30s. Many view the crown prince
                    as not suited to succeed King Hassan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would be rivals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: His brother or one of the cousins some view as a more viable
                    successor to King Hassan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they follow strict primogeniture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: In this case the crown prince is the eldest son. It is designated
                    in the constitution that he will succeed his father. Morocco is a constitutional
                    monarchy. However an amendment could be made by a compliant legislature if need
                    be. And, there could be rivals who are not members of the royal family, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, that brings us to the end of Morocco and you are

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 24, 1996 and this is the interviewer, Edward
                        Dillery, and the subject of the interview is Arnold Schifferdecker. When we
                        stopped last time you were returning to the United States after a tour in
                        Rabat. Your next assignment was in OES. What does OES stand for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oceans, Environment and Science. Actually I did a tour in the
                    Board of Examiners, a short one, then I went to the Bureau of Oceans,
                    Environment and Scientific Affairs to be the director for environmental policy
                    in that bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to the Board of Examiners later, so we will
                        cover that all in one segment. Tell us a little bit about what you did in
                        OES? You had worked on environment before, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I had done an out of agency tour at the Environmental Protection
                    Agency back in the late '70s, a two year stint working primarily on issues with
                    Canada and Mexico. This time I was given the directorship of the office of
                    environmental policy which included a lot of issues, primarily international
                    pollution control issues which included again Canada and Mexico, but also other
                    issues such as acid rain issues with the United States and Europe and the
                    problem of ozone layer depletion. Also, when I came into that assignment we were
                    preparing for the big United Nations conference on environment and development
                    in Rio which occurred in 1992.</p>
                <p>Primarily, we dealt with issues that were of global environmental concern, in
                    some cases local as well. A good example would be the implementation of the
                    Montreal Protocol which is designed and was agreed a few years prior to my
                    coming on the scene. The Montreal Protocol is anti-chlorofluorocarbons which are
                    chemical compounds of various kinds that deplete the stratosphere of ozone and
                    allow more ultraviolet radiation to strike the earth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are the guy who is messing up the car air
                        conditioning.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right. During our time and while I was in that job, this
                    was during the Bush Administration and it was this administration that agreed to
                    tightening up controls on CFC admissions and required we phase out the old style
                    of air conditioning all over the world, including automobiles in the United
                    States, as well as refrigeration and air conditioning all over the country.
                    These measures to protect the ozone layer and promote the use of more
                    environment friendly compounds that do the same job, these commitments that we
                    undertook under the Montreal Protocol, were phased in over time. In fact, some
                    of the commitments are yet to be achieved. New cars, for example, now have to
                    have ozone layer friendly air conditioning units, whereas just a few years ago
                    they used the old conventional Freon which depleted ozone when it escaped into
                    the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking a case like that, what did your office actually do?
                        Did you write the papers that would be used in the conference, or were you
                        more of a coordinator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We coordinated the interagency positions which involved the
                    Environmental Protection Agency, first of all, but many others. And, of course,
                    the White House was very interested in environmental issues and had to sign off
                    on positions that we took for conferences of the parties to the Montreal
                    Protocol, for example. There were other agreements also that we worked on, some
                    of which we were not yet a party to but where we participated in the conferences
                    because commitments were being made that we wanted to monitor or be involved in
                    to make sure that commitments were not taken which would cause us to not become
                    a signatory later. One of these was the Basel Convention on the transportation
                    of waste products, of garbage, of toxic substances, some of which can be
                    recycled. Some countries are involved in accepting toxic wastes from other
                    countries and reclaiming some of the metals or chemical compounds. For example,
                    silver in some industrial waste byproducts would be toxic if discharged or put
                    into a landfill untreated. This toxic garbage is exported to Switzerland and the
                    Swiss have a process whereby they recover certain precious metals from the waste
                    before they totally destroy it. This convention set up a control regime whereby
                    these wastes were handled safely and under certain rules of the road, so to
                    speak, including shipping by ocean transport, and other arrangements for their
                    reclamation and disposal. The Convention also protects poor countries,
                    developing countries, from unscrupulous international operators selling them a
                    bill of goods and paying someone to take toxic wastes off their hands and
                    disposing them in unsafe ways and inflicting damage on their own citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the convention police this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Most of the mechanism required national means to carry them out,
                    of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no international agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No. Well, there was a small secretariat for the convention but it
                    could not police these agreements because it didn't have the staffing and most
                    countries didn't want to pay for another huge bureaucracy. Much of the
                    implementation arrangements for many environmental treaties require individual
                    countries to police themselves. But, given that we have a free press in most
                    parts of the world, if a country is not carrying out its obligations under a
                    particular agreement, the word gets out very rapidly, especially if the United
                    States is involved. As you know our free press is very vigilant and learns about
                    most egregious cases, especially threats to the environment.</p>
                <p>I want to emphasize that we did not sign the Basel Convention on the
                    transportation of hazardous waste because the Congress refused to enact the
                    implementing legislation we needed in order to be able to sign this convention
                    and to my knowledge we still have not signed it because there are many disputes
                    in the United States over how we regulate our own wastes, how we transport
                    wastes between and among the 50 states of the United States. So, until those
                    issues are settled, Congress is not likely to give us the implementing
                    legislation that we need to sign on to this convention. Even though we still
                    carry out the obligations under that convention, we are not a signatory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This smells greatly of domestic politics and affected
                        industries. Were you affected by any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oh yes. In fact we were mandated by various executive orders or
                    directions from Congress through the Environmental Protection Agency to consult
                    with affected industries on any international agreement before we signed it. In
                    fact, many of the industrial groups in the United States sent NGO type
                    representatives to these meetings before, during and after negotiations. So,
                    they were part and parcel of international commitments that we undertake. These
                    are big, awkward negotiating sessions, with national governments, industry
                    groups and all ranges of NGOs such as Green Peace, hovering in the corridors and
                    taking part in plenary debates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Congress let you know they were not going to pass
                        legislation and urge us not to partake of these conventions? If so, who were
                        the main players in Congress on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Sometimes we got mixed signals from Congress, from either the
                    Democratic or Republic leadership at that time. Congressman Dingell was one who
                    paid a great deal of attention to the commitments we undertook with Canada on
                    acid rain because it affected a lot of coal fired power plants, automobile
                    plants in states in the Ohio Valley, Michigan and all the border states with
                    Canada. So before we signed the agreement with Canada to reduce emissions of
                    precursors to acid rain, i.e. sulfurous coal, we had to consult with almost all
                    of the affected states and members of congress before any agreement was signed.
                    And that was done religiously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the environmentally friendly organizations, what
                        role did they play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They pushed us from the other side, the opposite side from
                    industry. In many ways they supported stronger language in agreements such as in
                    the Montreal Protocol. They favored earlier phaseout dates for various CFC
                    components and compounds from industry. But, we, in a way, in the State
                    Department were required to with the help of Congress and, of course, the
                    executive branch, the President, to balance off the competing interests, the
                    environmentalists versus the industrial people. It affected business concerns,
                    and, of course, that was a legitimate concern too affecting the bottom line of
                    many industries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier when you were working in IO you were
                        working on similar kinds of activities and most of the things you mentioned
                        working on in OES have also had some sort of United Nations connection, not
                        all but a good part of it. What was the differences between what the two
                        bureau did and why do we need both offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The International Organizations Bureau of the State Department
                    works with all organizations that deal multilaterally, including primarily the
                    United Nations as well as other international organizations, some regional in
                    nature. The OES Bureau is involved primarily with organizations such as UN
                    Environmental Program, the Economic Commission for Europe and other
                    organizations, including the OSCE, that are concerned with environmental issues,
                    not necessarily all of them being subsidiaries of the United Nations. Also, the
                    OES Bureau is charged with implementing many international agreements that are
                    only agreements among parties, they don't necessarily involve the United Nations
                    Environment Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the relations between offices in IO and OES that
                        worked on the same issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: OES had the main staff that dealt with environmental issues and
                    if it involved the United Nations we worked with the IO Bureau to make sure they
                    were conversant with what we were doing. They attended some of our interagency
                    meetings which forged the US position for various conferences and negotiations.
                    If it involved the United Nations in Geneva or UN Environmental Program in
                    Nairobi, IO had representatives at these meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the UN Environmental Program, is it a useful
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It has a mixed record so far. I don't recall exactly when UNEP
                    was created, I believe about the same time that our own national Environmental
                    Protection Agency was created and such agencies were created in other countries.
                    Its leadership was not always the strongest. It didn't always command sufficient
                    budget to be able to staff ambitious UN programs. Other agencies that dealt with
                    development such as Food and Agricultural Organization, UN Development Program,
                    had bigger budgets and were able to call the shots on international development.
                    The problem became such that several international conferences under the United
                    Nations were held, the last one being the one I referred to earlier, the UN
                    Conference on Environment and Development in Rio. At that meeting the United
                    Nations developers and environmentalists tried to bring their two programs
                    together so that development proceeded in a sustainable manner, or was not
                    destructive to the environment. Now sustainable development, of course, is still
                    to be realized but at least it was a stab and start in the direction of
                    understanding that if you build a large irrigation project you must account for
                    the environmental consequences. In brief, the Rio Conference called on all
                    countries to take account of the existing ecosystem before disturbing or
                    changing it for the economic benefit of its people.</p>
                <p>The UN Environment Program also has a role in helping to implement international
                    agreements. They provide the secretariats for a number of agreements such as the
                    Montreal Protocol. So, they do perform a useful function. The problem in Nairobi
                    is that the communications are bad, it's distant from where much of the work and
                    negotiation is taking place on the environment. So, UNEP has a large subsidiary
                    organization located in Geneva, which is much more convenient because many of
                    our meetings are held in Geneva, Europe or North America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the establishment of UNEP in Nairobi was partly to
                        satisfy African demands for more activity in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the White House get involved in environmental
                        affairs? Is the EPA seen as part of the White House or did they have a
                        separate entity that handled such affairs? Who actually chaired the meetings
                        when you were getting ready to come up with the final US government policy
                        on issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The State Department always insisted that State Department people
                    chair interagency meetings on international environmental policy. The White
                    House had a domestic policy council and also had a special office that looked at
                    environmental regulations that were being promulgated either by EPA or other
                    agencies that have regulatory functions for domestic environmental legislation.
                    Those activities took place separate from our meetings where we were preparing
                    for various international meetings.</p>
                <p>One of the big new activities that we were taking part in in my bureau was the
                    international climate change negotiations that were being hammered out and are
                    still under discussion, which have far reaching consequences, of course, for US
                    industry. Now that was a separate office from mine because the issues were so
                    large and complex a separate office had been created when I arrived in the OES
                    Bureau. The officers dealing with climate issues had to be very closely plugged
                    into the White House decision making people because of the large economic
                    implications if you have to cut CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide emissions. That
                    affects our heating, air conditioning and just about every activity involving
                    combustion of gas or oil or other fossil fuel. So, the Department of Energy was
                    concerned. People in the Department of Commerce to deal with atmosphere, NOAA,
                    were involved in scientific research and verifying whether global warming is or
                    isn't a problem. So, there was an international negotiation as well as a
                    domestic negotiation going on as to what we really thought the dimensions of the
                    problem were. The White House was vitally interested in those issues and was
                    probably more interested in those issues than in the issues that I dealt with,
                    that is, more conventional environmental protection issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we had a delegation to the meeting to work on these
                        conventions, who would actually head the delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: A deputy assistant secretary, or the assistant secretary himself
                    or herself, or myself, as office director. I headed some delegations at
                    international meetings but by no means all because the front office of OES had a
                    DAS for each set of issues. One that dealt with oceans, one that dealt with
                    climate almost exclusively, and one that dealt with other environmental issues.
                    So, depending on whether they were preoccupied somewhere else, or were primarily
                    concerned with the issue that I was dealing with, they would head the
                    delegation. Or, in the case of the UN Environment Development conference in Rio,
                    the head of the delegation was the President, himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your deputy assistant secretaries and your
                        assistant secretaries during your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The assistant secretary was Buff Bohlen during the first part of
                    my tour, then Elinor Constable came in towards the end of my two year stint. The
                    deputy assistant secretary that I worked with was a political appointee, Bob
                    Reinstein, who had long been in the Department of Energy and other federal jobs
                    before coming over to State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other thoughts on that assignment in OES? Let me ask
                        you a general question about that. What is your sense of the value of that
                        bureau for the United States as a whole and the Department in particular?
                        Given its dichotomy of trying to be an expert on the issues and trying to
                        coordinate the international aspects of it, it seems like sometimes you
                        almost fall in between the two with some people knowing more about the
                        specifics of an issue and others who are better placed to work on the
                        international aspects, particularly in bilateral cases. What is your
                        response to that line of thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Overall, the work of OES I think is very important and it is
                    important that the United States continue to play a leadership role so that we
                    not only help to reduce global pollution, but also to insure that the
                    commitments undertaken under various agreements are realistic and achievable. I
                    think the State Department has played and should continue to play a strong
                    leadership role.</p>
                <p>As you might suspect, a number of the people assigned to OES are civil servants,
                    not necessarily FSOs, the balance is about 50-50 I believe, which is a much
                    higher percentage of GS to FS people than in most bureaus. That is probably for
                    a good reason as well. You need more continuity in dealing with many of these
                    technical issues and you need some people with technical backgrounds. Although,
                    I would argue that FSO generalists also can do a good job of steering the issues
                    and of having the right feel for the international environment and also in
                    dealing with other agencies. Many of the players in the interagency environment
                    were generalists as well, not necessarily technical people. You need to
                    understand the basic technical issues, but you don't need to have a detailed
                    grasp of all technical aspects to be able to deal with such issues. You can
                    borrow technical experts from other agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your counterparts like in other countries? Did
                        they have similar organizations to ours or did you find that they have more
                        continuity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They tended to have a combination also of foreign office people
                    and environmental protection agency people. They seemed to have more of the EPA
                    types at meetings than we did, perhaps, at least heading the delegation. That
                    has been a problem or an issue that we have been dealing with in OES, that is
                    EPA and to some extent some of the other agencies would like to be able to chair
                    international meetings that deal with issues that they legally are responsible
                    for under domestic US law. However, State has argued just as strongly that it is
                    necessary for the State Department, which is not a technical agency as concerns
                    the environment, to deal with issues fairly in the interagency context and to be
                    an honest broker, as I used to put it in many interagency meetings, among
                    competing interests and to find out where the balance should be and then convey
                    that in international negotiations or conferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other final thoughts on OES? I guess that was your
                        last official exposure to the environment as such.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right. I felt that my earlier tour in EPA had given me
                    some good credentials. I was familiar with many of the issues, they don't change
                    that rapidly, although global warming was an issue that was fairly new when I
                    came back to the environment in OES. The EPA experience at least had given me a
                    leg up in getting into the issues fairly quickly after I arrived, and going off
                    to meetings and chairing interagency meetings fairly soon after I entered on
                    duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left OES, when was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to the Board of Examiners for a second
                        stint. How long were you there the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: A little over a year the first time before OES. In that job I was
                    the deputy staff director to Marshall Casse, who was the staff director. We were
                    just redoing the Foreign Service exam after a major law suit in which the
                    Department of State agreed that the exam through a purely statistical analysis
                    seemed to be discriminatory against women—the written exam not the oral exam.
                    The oral exam was what the Board of Examiners administers. The written exam is
                    developed on the outside by contractor, in this case, the Educational Testing
                    Service in Princeton. However, the monitoring of it and the fairness of it and
                    the questions that were used on the exam had to be vetted through the Board of
                    Examiners to make sure that the questions were reflective of our need for
                    well-rounded Foreign Service officer candidates and also that were not
                    discriminatory in any way. I argued, after looking at this whole thing, that the
                    test, itself, was not discriminatory against women or minorities, but that the
                    fact that the pass rates for this exam were not completely reflective of groups
                    of takers, that is the percentage of white males or females or minority passers
                    were not equal. My argument was that these results were a reflection of what
                    people had studied and were interested in in college, etc., although we couldn't
                    statistically prove this and the State Department did not try to prove it in
                    court. The Department did agree to try and take another look at the exam and try
                    to make it as unbiased as it could possibly be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that effort completed while you were still there the
                        first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It was, although the exam was again challenged after my departure
                    by the same women's class action suit that had won remedial action earlier, that
                    is the Alison Palmer group. The new exam was based on a thorough job analysis of
                    what Foreign Service officers did and what they needed to know before they came
                    into the Service and what they could learn on the job and therefore didn't need
                    to be tested for such as languages or country specific material. The new exam,
                    therefore, was based on what Foreign Service officers, who had already been in
                    the Service for a number of years said was necessary to know when they came in
                    and could not be learned easily on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: By doing a very thorough questionnaire of second and third tour
                    officers, people who had been in less than ten years, consular, political,
                    economic and admin officers. So, the new exam seemed to reflect fairly well what
                    these persons told us they needed to know and was not in any way biased toward
                    any particular group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, if that group you questioned was biased toward
                        another group wouldn't that be a second generation of bias?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, we took pains to make sure the analysis was a big enough
                    cross section of Foreign Service people that included all of the relevant
                    groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of changes were made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: There were fewer questions on specific country information, fewer
                    trivial pursuit type of questions which wouldn't necessarily prove that you
                    would be a good Foreign Service officer if you happened to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember on my exam a question was how many home runs
                        did Babe Ruth hit in 1930?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I don't think I would have gotten that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: What was put into the exam was more on the United States, on US
                    history, constitution, culture, because the job analysis discovered that Foreign
                    Service officers said we represent the United States of America and therefore
                    should know more about our own country. We can learn a lot of other stuff about
                    country X and country Y by area studies at FSI after we come in or self study.
                    So, this was felt to be quite a major change in the emphasis in the exam.
                    Although, there were many questions maintained on different parts of the world
                    so that people could show their knowledge of geography and world history and to
                    some extent, recent international politics. But, there was a little less stress
                    in these areas than formerly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there long enough to see the results of one of
                        the new exams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Oh yes. The results were a little bit closer to being reflective
                    of the various groups that took the exam; however, they never really completely
                    resulted in pass rates where the percentage of passers was equal across all
                    groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The argument of the suit against the Department was that
                        of the number of people who take the exam, the proportion that pass should
                        be the same as the proportion of the various groups taking the exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Or within one standard deviation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they didn't quite make that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right. So they are talking now, I understand, of throwing
                    out the written exam. I have strong reservations against it, that is my
                    bias.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I feel a written exam is not the end-all and be-all of what makes
                    a good Foreign Service officer, but the results should show that people have
                    been interested in the issues that Foreign Service work comprises and the
                    results should also be looked at as simply a screening device. The oral exam is
                    where you evaluate the in-depth knowledge and personal characteristics of
                    Foreign Service officers, and that is why the oral exam is equally if not more
                    important than the written exam. The written exam is merely a ticket to the oral
                    exam. But, you should be able to get that ticket through some legitimate display
                    of a breadth of knowledge of world affairs, as well as of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that one of the problems is that more people
                        deserve a ticket to the orals than can be accommodated? What are the
                        restrictions on the number of people who can take the oral examination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The restrictions are basically how many people can you run
                    through in one given year and how much staff do you have available to administer
                    that exam in a completely fair and unbiased way. In theory there is no
                    restriction on the number you can test in the oral exam. In fact, the first year
                    I was there after the new exam, there was a larger population to the oral exam
                    than there had been in previous years. I don't know if that still holds now
                    because as you know we did not give the exam in 1995 because the intake had
                    dropped off so much and we had a large number of people on the register who had
                    very little chance of getting an appointment. So, it was felt that in 1995 the
                    written exam and oral exam should not be given, the whole cycle, was missed.
                    But, I am glad to see that the written exam is going to be given again in 1996
                    and there will be an oral assessment following that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that the proposal, although it is not clear,
                        means that there would be a pilot program of no written examination, but
                        some system based on written qualifications like acceptance to grad school
                        or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Or experience maybe in some cases. Well, that should be tried I
                    think. I wouldn't say it is invalid as a way of screening applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it seemed to me that the written examination was one
                        of the important rites of passage. That it was coming in the old fashioned
                        way. Although, I have to confess that even as far back as I can remember
                        some of the most successful people in the Foreign Service have not been
                        those who came in by way of the written examination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Although there aren't very many who fall in that category, who
                    became career Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to name some, Reg Bartholomew, Tony Gillespie,
                        Michael Armacost. There have been some pretty famous people who did not take
                        the exam. Now, part of that was a result of Wriston when they brought a lot
                        of civil servant into the Foreign Service. To me the great advantage of the
                        written examination is that it makes entrance to the Foreign Service
                        feasible for everyone in America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It's very democratic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and even though I think an interest in foreign
                        affairs is vital for passing it and being successful, if we were to begin to
                        recruit on the basis of the best degrees in international affairs or from
                        schools of the Foreign Service and that sort of thing, there again you would
                        limit your intake to a certain kind of person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, let's move to the oral. What were your impressions of that? Is it a good
                    system? Does it produce the people we want?</p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think it is a good system. It is very thorough. When you and I
                    took the orals, I think mine lasted a couple of hours, perhaps, at least part of
                    an afternoon. Now it is all day. They come in very early in the morning and have
                    to do two written products, display negotiating skills...it is not a one-on-one
                    or two-on-one type of interview Q&amp;A any more as it used to be. Now it is
                    much more going through exercises that are designed to show skills that a
                    Foreign Service officer should have, needs to have, in order to be successful.
                    These have evolved over a number of years.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>There was a fairly big change during my time and that was to have a candidate do
                    a brand new role playing exercise. The first task was to read a large volume of
                    materials including a cable of instructions from Washington, the candidate
                    playing a political or economic or admin or consular officer overseas. Then,
                    after an hour of study of the material the candidate delivered a demarche before
                    two examiners who played the role of foreign ministry officials or other
                    ministry officials of a host government. We called it the demarche exercise. The
                    candidate had to be quick thinking, persuasive, articulate, and exhibit the many
                    qualities we expect a person to have when they are doing this actual work
                    overseas. The two examiners playing the role of foreign officials tended to
                    challenge very severely the basis for the demarche and particulars so that the
                    candidate then had to display, as I say, quick thinking, capability to marshal
                    arguments, to counter doubts cast on the whole exercise by the foreign
                    officials. So, we thought it was a very realistic exercise.</p>
                <p>After the demarche exercise was completed, the candidate would have to compose a
                    telegram back to Washington, telling the Department the results of the demarche
                    that was made to foreign officials. Here we tested not only writing skills and
                    whether the candidate was accurately reporting the results of the demarche,
                    testing a little bit his other integrity and whether they shaded or didn't shade
                    the result. It was amazing the different kind of approaches taken by some
                    candidates. Some glossed over or completely omitted parts where the demarche was
                    not very successful, and that was always judged to be misleading and graded
                    down. So, you could test many characteristics of a candidate from one simple
                    exercise, and there were other exercises as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that one last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That lasted one hour for preparation, one hour for actual doing
                    and one hour for writing up the demarche results. So, it took three hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other exercises?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: One of the other more time honored elements of the oral exam is a
                    group exercise where all four, five or six candidates, however many we have for
                    a particular group, get together to comprise an embassy task force. Each one is
                    given a community development project that is to be funded by the ambassador's
                    discretionary fund. The element of competition comes out in these exercises and
                    the Examiners are able to judge the way candidates interact with each other much
                    as they would in a country team setting or any kind of group meeting that they
                    would have in a mission or in the Department. Here the candidates must first
                    study their project and master the details. Then after about a half hour of
                    preparation the Examiners enter the room and the candidate gives a briefing
                    about his or her project, its good points and its bad points (each project
                    contains strong points and drawbacks) so the Examiners are able to judge how
                    accurately these are portrayed and whether they are portrayed fairly. Then,
                    after each candidate displays their briefing skills and how well they depict
                    their project they are given a limited amount of funds and there are not enough
                    funds, of course, for funding all the projects, so they have to negotiate among
                    themselves as to which project or projects should be funded and at what level.
                    This makes for a very interesting hour of interaction among the candidates. Then
                    the candidates are asked to leave and get a cup of coffee while the day's
                    results then are weighed.</p>
                <p>Another part of the exercise that they had done previously was an essay on a
                    topic of their choice. They select one of five or six topics and write an
                    essay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they do that while they are there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They usually do that before lunch hour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long does the group exercise take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It takes an hour and a half to two hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, so far we have used up 4 and a half hours. The essay
                        would be another hour bringing it to 5 and a half hours. How much more is
                        involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They have some breaks in between and we do allow them to go to
                    lunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. But those two are the two major exercises or are
                        there others as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Those are the major two and the written exercise I mentioned.
                    They have added some other elements to the oral exam and I am not completely up
                    to date, so I probably don't need to go into those because some of them may have
                    been dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But those two were the most important elements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. You will notice in these exercises we weren't looking for
                    particular knowledge that the candidate brought with him or her. They were only
                    asked to display certain skills of being able to depict things accurately, to be
                    persuasive. Its their personal characteristics that we were looking at for the
                    most part during the oral exam and not knowledge. The oral used to be composed
                    of a lot of questions and answers about their depth of knowledge on a particular
                    economic or political issues or international issue. That we do not test for
                    again because that is either covered in the written exam or they can learn it on
                    the job and don't need to bring it with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens after the whole thing is over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Then there is a period of evaluation of the results. The
                    candidates have to achieve a cutoff score on the day's exercises that would
                    continue their candidacy into the security background check and eventually, if
                    they pass that, their name would go on the register. We also give exit
                    interviews to those candidates who were unsuccessful and let them know that we
                    appreciated their interest, sorry we are not taking many in and although you did
                    well your score wasn't high enough to merit continuation of your candidacy. We
                    also give what we called a personal interview lasting one hour for successful
                    candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that part of that same day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Yes. They are there until five and sometimes six o'clock in the
                    evening. That interview is deemed to be an important part of the process because
                    there are a number of candidates who know very little about the Foreign Service
                    and this gives them a chance to ask questions about what they are getting into
                    and gives the Examiners one more chance to see the candidate under more relaxed
                    circumstances where they can be evaluated yet again as to whether they would be
                    suitable...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After telling them they have been successful you might
                        change your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We tell them that they were successful up to the point of the
                    personal interview. There have been very few cases where a candidate was washed
                    out after the personal interview, because either it was found that the candidate
                    had very unrealistic expectations of the Foreign Service or the candidate,
                    himself or herself, realized that “this really isn't for me” or “I was taking
                    the exam because I knew it was challenging and wanted to see if I could pass
                    it.” That has happened a few times as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you make that determination on the very day that they
                        go through this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you do that? What if you wanted to take all six of
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, it has happened a few times. If all six pass the oral then
                    they have to line up for personal interviews and sometimes it can go late into
                    the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't take everybody. Suppose you took six on Monday
                        and got down to the next Monday and six more passed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It doesn't happen that often. The cutoff score is established to
                    control the flow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you could have a case where nobody out of the six would
                        pass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That is right and the pass rate tended to be from around 11 to 14
                    percent of those who took the oral. Not a very high pass rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How are the Examiners trained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: They are trained about the time the written exam is given before
                    the oral begins usually in January. There is an intensive training period of
                    about a week or ten days and some practice exams are given before the new crop
                    of written exam passers come to the oral. There have been at times up to 20-25
                    Examiners in B/EX who have administered the oral exam for the first six months
                    of the year. Many Examiners come for a short period of time—six months, eight
                    months, one year—and they almost universally state that they thought it was a
                    very important function, demanding job, an interesting experience, and that they
                    were proud to have worked to find the best and the brightest that we want to
                    have in the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of them say that, what do you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I say the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first year at B/EX you were deputy director of the
                        staff, what were you doing the second year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The second time I came just as an Examiner to finish out my
                    career. I did spend three months in New York at the General Assembly as area
                    advisor for South Asia in 1994 before I retired in 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is an area advisor? What do they do and where do they
                        do it and how do they do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: During the UN General Assembly there are so many issues dealt
                    with during that intensive period of three to three and a half months in New
                    York that the staff at the US Mission in New York is really overwhelmed and
                    unable to deal with all of the issues by themselves. So, each geographic bureau
                    has traditionally sent someone to be the area advisor and to deal with many of
                    those issues that come up in the General Assembly. That is what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One from each bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That's right, one person. We either live in New York or commute
                    back to Washington on weekends. I did this now both in my last official
                    assignment before retiring and also after I retired I was reappointed and asked
                    to do that again in 1995 and again in 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a day in the life of an advisor like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: First of all we begin by reading our e-mail just as any desk
                    officer or officer director might in Washington because there is a lot of
                    diplomacy going on prior to the General Assembly. Next, we have to be in touch
                    with our people in Washington either by phone or by e-mail or fax. We are
                    sending them documents, draft resolutions, that sort of thing from New York and
                    they are reacting and getting instructions back to us. Normally instructions
                    have to come by official State Department cable; however, sometimes we need to
                    have reactions faster than instruction cables can be cleared in Washington, so
                    we are on the phone and sometimes on classified fax machines or classified
                    e-mail in order to get the information we need. The meetings in the General
                    Assembly begin around 10 or 10:30 every morning and that doesn't give much time
                    for the offices in Washington to give instructions, or reactions or
                    guidance.</p>
                <p>The meetings last all day. There are either plenary meetings of the General
                    Assembly in the Great Hall or more likely committee sessions and sometimes small
                    negotiating groups that are acting on behalf of one of the committees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say your people, who are your people in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: In my case, within the South Asia Bureau it would be the
                    assistant secretary, her deputy or one of the office directors. It is a small
                    bureau and has only three office directors. Or a country desk officer if the
                    issue concerns a specific country. One of the issues I worked on a lot was
                    Afghanistan so I was in touch a lot with the Afghan desk officers, there were
                    two of them, and with the country director at that time, Mr. Coldren. Also, the
                    assistant secretary, Robin Raphel, came to New York for bilateral meetings
                    during the early phases of the General Assembly and a couple of times afterwards
                    to talk to either individual heads of delegation foreign ministers or UN
                    secretariat officials. So, I was always kept busy when Robin came to New York
                    attending meetings with her and reporting the results of those meetings just
                    like a USUN officer might be expected to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say that, was there any friction between you and
                        South Asia and IO and/or between you and the regular political or economic
                        section of USUN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, in fact, the area advisors were normally doubling up in
                    offices. The office space is not that generous in USUN so as a result we
                    normally sat in the same office as the USUN officer who handled that issue in
                    normal times when there wasn't a General Assembly. So, we were on the same wave
                    length with the mission at all times.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>There were very few conflicts or problems of coordination with the IO bureau or
                    with the bureau we represented, in my case South Asia. I seldom had problems.
                    There were problems of coordination from time to time, making sure everyone was
                    on the same music sheet, but seldom any coordination issues for me in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relationships with your other area
                        counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: We dealt with them just as though we were a mission officer,
                    temporarily assigned. We dealt with their ambassador, deputy ambassador or
                    counselors or whoever we needed to deal with on issues.</p>
                <p>Perhaps one way to understand it better would be for me to give you an example of
                    dealing with the issue of Afghanistan. The UN had a special mission on
                    Afghanistan headed by a special appointee, a Tunisian named Ambassador Mestiri,
                    who was in the region, most of the time in Islamabad, trying to negotiate the
                    end to the factional fighting in Afghanistan. Each year the General Assembly
                    draws up a resolution which comprises this special representative's negotiating
                    instructions. It wasn't a very easy thing to do because there were conflicts
                    among the neighboring powers, Iran, Pakistan, India, Russia and the “stans”
                    (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) plus the United States, Egypt, Turkey
                    and a few other players. So, what I did was to set up an ad hoc resolution
                    negotiating committee and persuaded the Germans to chair it because we felt they
                    would be seen as more of a neutral country. During the General Assembly we met
                    off site usually at the German mission, and over a period of a month or two
                    negotiated an acceptable resolution. But, it took a lot of time and to get the
                    right policy words into the resolution I needed to coordinate almost on a daily
                    basis with the bureau in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having been to two General Assemblies, what is your
                        general impression as a whole and its usefulness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: It is very hard to characterize a huge body like the United
                    Nations, which has so many facets to it. For example, the Security Council is
                    the body that the United States pays most attention to because its resolutions
                    are mandatory if they are passed and not vetoed and it deals with the most
                    sensitive security issues, of course, the political issues of the world.
                    Sometimes the United States and other countries choose to bypass the UN, but
                    when we don't and when we expect the UN to be the nexus for our policy, it
                    becomes a very important function—passing Security Council resolutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Of course they are not always effective. For example, take the United Nations'
                    role in Bosnia, as defined by a number of Security Council resolutions,
                    countless resolutions. The record of the United Nations in Bosnia was poor
                    because the Security Council resolutions were the product of too many unworkable
                    compromises. As you know we have the Dayton Peace Accords and NATO/IFOR
                    implementation process going on now.</p>
                <p>So, the United Nations is important only as individual countries, particularly
                    the permanent members, give it importance. Otherwise it can be ignored,
                    neglected, pilloried. It can be a convenient scapegoat at times for various
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Look at the issue of Iraq and the Gulf War. Although much of the Gulf War
                    participation was negotiated by the United States, by Secretary of State Baker,
                    the actual war, itself, the action was authorized by the United Nations, by the
                    Security Council. The aftermath of the war was very carefully orchestrated
                    through the United Nations and the regime of sanctions that we have on the
                    Saddam Hussein government in Baghdad were all passed by the Security Council by
                    the unanimous wishes of the permanent members. So, it is a very important
                    process that we have going on there.</p>
                <p>There are many other examples where the UN has considerable importance. Where it
                    is losing value, I think, is through the General Assembly. The resolutions there
                    are not mandatory, they are advisory in nature. They have a certain moral force,
                    especially when they are passed by consensus, but when there is a split vote of
                    let's say 55-45 with 45-50 abstentions, you don't have very much moral force
                    behind that resolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our system of representation of United States
                        interests in the United Nations? Do you like the organization and things
                        like the fact of the special role given to the permanent representative and
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: The US, I think currently is superbly represented at our UN
                    Mission in New York by Madeleine Albright and her immediate deputy, Skip Gnehm.
                    The role given to Ambassador Albright, as a member of the cabinet, I think is
                    very crucial. It gives that person and the job of representing the United States
                    in the world body special importance and it helps to keep us focused on the UN
                    as a way of trying to resolve many problems, some of which do not necessarily go
                    through the Security Council but are handled by other agencies and bodies of the
                    UN. But, in the cases of major UN Security Council issues like Iraq or Bosnia, I
                    think it is important that the UN representative in New York has cabinet status
                    and maintains an office in the State Department with a small staff so that she
                    can keep a base in Washington as well as New York and can coordinate our
                    national security decisions working with State and the NSC. One of her deputies
                    is frequently handling issues in New York. She is down here either in the White
                    House or in the Department pursuing policy initiatives that she feels are
                    important to our goals in the UN.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have concluded your formal time in the Foreign Service,
                        however, you served in countries with widely and varying different brands of
                        Islam and with the question of Islam in general being one of the larger
                        issues of concern to the United States at this time, I wonder if you could
                        tell us what your thoughts are on that subject? How were your different
                        customers different and what is the significance and direction of Islam in
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I think this is a very important issue because Americans tend to
                    look at the Muslim world as kind of a monolithic force and frequently Muslims
                    are viewed in negative terms in the United States. I would start out by staying
                    that given all the countries that I have been in or observed or traveled in or
                    been posted to in the Muslim world, Islam is definitely not a monolith, although
                    frequently the United States looks at the Muslim world through the lens of one
                    particular issue, that is the Arab/Israeli conflict. When we see militant or
                    extremist violent reactions of Muslim fundamentalists to Israel or to some
                    aspect of our policy on Israel, we tend to see them all colored with the same
                    green shade, green being the color of the prophet and the reason why many Muslim
                    flags are green. We tend to see the Islamic world as militant, as anti-Western,
                    anti-Israel, and in many cases fanatic. But, that is not true at all. We deal
                    very closely and on very friendly terms with a number of Muslim states. For
                    example, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Pakistan, Malaysia, many of the Gulf
                    countries. We are highly dependent on the Gulf for oil supplies. In fact, in
                    practice we tend to deal with Islamic countries on a country by country basis
                    and not as sort of a religious kind of force that we have to cope with.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, we have to understand also that fundamentalist Islam is
                    frequently not just religious in nature, it is aimed at political and social
                    reform. There are many authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and citizens of
                    those countries who feel repressed politically tend to behave in an exaggerated
                    and sometimes egregious ways. So we should look at Islamic fundamentalism,
                    perhaps as playing a role similar to the one Christianity played in medieval
                    times in Europe, that is, sometimes there were waves of fanaticism and, of
                    course, much of the leadership of the European countries was based on religious
                    affiliation. In the Middle East we see the fanatics, such as those in Iran or in
                    Libya or in the Sudan as the ones that exemplify the worst aspects of the
                    fundamentalist religions body. But, in fact, there are many moderate regimes
                    that we deal with and who deal with us not on the basis of any kind of religion
                    or concern. Even now as peace is being made with Israel, we are entering into
                    many more pragmatic relationships than we have had before when the Arab-Israeli
                    problem prevented us from having close relations with many countries of the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you in simple terms explain the differences in Islam
                        in Afghanistan, Turkey and Morocco? What would be the similarities and what
                        would be the differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Let me start with Turkey which is at one end of the spectrum.
                    Turkey consciously made a decision to de-emphasize the role of Islam in society
                    when the Republic of Turkey was created by Ataturk in 1923 and explicitly Turkey
                    was made a constitutional, secular state. Even the Arabic script that Turkish
                    had been written in was changed into Latin characters to emphasize Turkey's
                    desire no longer to face East, but to face West. Over some 75 years that Turkey
                    has been a secular non-Islamic republic, reactions have set in against this and
                    we now have in Turkey a very strong religious party that is knocking on the
                    doors of power and, in fact, nearly came to power but could not seem to get the
                    nod to create its own government.</p>
                <p>At the same time I would emphasize that this religious party in Turkey is
                    knocking on the door to power through constitutional means and is by no means a
                    party that would totally turn its back on modernization or many of the reforms
                    that were made by Ataturk, although they would tend to be more sensitive to the
                    religious nature of the country and the beliefs of the people. I do not believe
                    that Turkey is headed for some sort of fundamentalist turnaround and negation of
                    all that Ataturk has done for the country.</p>
                <p>In Afghanistan, you have a much less developed country which did call itself an
                    Islamic monarchy and then later a government and for a short time it was
                    declared secular by a Communist regime, which was implanted but thrown out. The
                    country, itself, is very pious and women are veiled. Although there was a period
                    of time when I was there in the '70s, when not all the women were veiled and
                    there was a very strong pro-Western bias to the monarchy. Afghanistan, I
                    believe, has reverted back to its very strong emphasis on religious observance,
                    public display of piety, but overall, most Afghans tend to be fairly pragmatic
                    in their observance of religion.</p>
                <p>In Morocco, something akin to Jordan, the monarch traces his lineage back to the
                    Prophet Muhammad and you have what you might call a state sanctioned religious
                    regime. But, in Morocco, King Hassan espouses a very tolerant brand of Islam. He
                    has always wanted to make peace with Israel and have relations with Israel.
                    Moroccan Jews still live unmolested and practice their religion in Morocco in
                    two major cities, Casablanca and Rabat, although most of the Moroccan Jews
                    immigrated to Israel back in the '50s and early '60s.</p>
                <p>The three regimes represent mostly a tolerant and moderate practice of the
                    Islamic religion, except for recent backsliding into more extremist practices in
                    Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you don't see the Islamic bogeyman, so to speak, in
                        panic terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, I would not. That is not to say there are not things that we
                    should take seriously. One of them is international terrorism which is
                    frequently in the Middle East done under the cloak of Islam or religion, when,
                    in fact, it probably should be viewed more as political extremism rather than as
                    some generalized threat to secularism or Christianity as it sometimes is
                    viewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In relation to that, is there a basic Islam belief in
                        evangelism and proselytism? Would they like to have everyone be
                        Islamic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: When I was in Pakistan there was a certain branch of the Sunnis
                    who were advocating and practicing proselytization in foreign countries as well
                    as in their own neighborhoods. But, for the most part, practitioners of Islam
                    try and hold together what they have and do not proselytize the way Christians
                    have by sending people to foreign countries. A certain amount of this is done,
                    of course, but it is fairly low key.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not a large missionary effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: No, not formal like in the Mormon sense of sending young people
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or like some Catholics in the old days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: That is true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize that I left out Pakistan. How about Islam in
                        Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Well, there are so many strains of Islam in Pakistan that it is
                    very hard to generalize; again we have no monolithic structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is more diverse than any of the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: I would say yes. There are several schools of Sunni Islam
                    practiced in parts of Pakistan. Some of it varies according to the particular
                    province or ethnic group the people come from. There are about 15 percent who
                    are Shia, some very pro-Iranian. There is a good deal of sectarian violence in
                    Pakistan today, much of it Sunni vs Shia. There are some differences among the
                    Shia as well. In fact, some of the Pakistanis that I dealt with were Shia
                    leaders who were by no means pro-Iran or pro-Khomeini, who were respected
                    businessmen and moved easily in international circles. One of my business
                    contacts in Lahore was the Pakistani head of the World Wildlife Fund, a big
                    international NGO located in Geneva. He was trying to help save one of the
                    desert birds of Pakistan, the bustard, which was increasingly being hunted by
                    Sheikhs from the Gulf who would come over with their falcons because they had
                    already finished off their own populations of bustard in the Gulf and were
                    beginning to do the same in Pakistan. This Pakistani Shia leader, Babar Ali
                    Shah, was head of a big industrial concern and was trying to save this
                    endangered species in Pakistan. A very moderate and modern person he was. So, in
                    Pakistan you had Muslims killing Muslims in Karachi and you still have it. Some
                    of it is more ethnic than it is religious but yet they attack each other in
                    their mosques, they attack worshipers when they are coming out of their mosques.
                    So violence is not always being committed against foreigners or Westerners but
                    sometimes it occurs among co-religionists in countries like Pakistan. I might
                    add that one of the small sects of Islam in Pakistan, the Ismaili sect, is
                    exceptionally moderate and tolerant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess of the four, Pakistan is the best demonstration of
                        the fact that Islam is not monolithic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Very definitely. Perhaps it more closely resembles early
                    Christian sectarianism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that occur because of the fact that the old India was
                        so big?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Part of it occurred when the Persian empire was expanded and
                    ruled parts of what are now India and Pakistan, some of the people were
                    converted or espoused Shiaism while others, who had been of the Sunni
                    persuasion, remained so. And, part of it is due to this historical migrations of
                    peoples between India and Pakistan before and after partition. Many Bangladeshi
                    coming to West Pakistan after Bangladesh became independent. Stresses and
                    strains between Kashmir and India produced quite a bit of Islamic fundamentalism
                    in Kashmir which is now embroiled in a major guerrilla insurrection with Indian
                    troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other last thoughts? We have come to the end of our
                        tape and it has been a great pleasure to interview you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SCHIFFERDECKER: Thank you, I have enjoyed it. I have one additional thought on
                    the Islamic front. I feel that we should not ignore fundamentalist Islam but by
                    the same token our policy should try to cultivate and accommodate the moderate
                    and tolerant strains and ideals of Islam, which do exist. We should remain
                    strongly opposed, of course, to the violent and extremist manifestations of
                    fanatic Islam as we see coming out of Libya, Sudan and to some extent Iran
                    still.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On that interesting note and policy advice, we will close
                        the interview. This completes the interview of Arnold Schifferdecker. Today
                        is June 24, 1996. Thank you very much.</hi>
