                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is an interview with Stevenson McIlvaine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: My father was from Downingtown, PA. That's where I became a lifelong
                    fan of the Philadelphia Phillies, a cross I continue to bear not always in good
                    humor. My father parlayed his Republican connections into a job with Henry Cabot
                    Lodge, the New England chairman of the Eisenhower-Nixon campaign in '52. Out of
                    that he got a political appointment to the State Department, public affairs, and
                    came down and was in Public Affairs in the Department right at the time of the
                    McCarthy stuff and spent an awful lot of time explaining to the Senate why the
                    third violinist in that orchestra the Department sent overseas was a card
                    carrying member of the Communist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Focusing on you now, up to the time you were 10, you were
                        a kid in Pennsylvania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes, and then we moved here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had 3 or 4 years of schooling up there. How did you
                        find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was fine. I started out in local Quaker schools and then in the
                    public schools, which in central Pennsylvania at that time were integrated and
                    that was all fine and understood. Then I came to Washington and the first
                    segregated schools I'd ever seen and they were awful. Sixth grade in a
                    Washington public school was a real eye opener. It was all white and it was
                    terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point, the schools in-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Even I knew it was lousy as a sixth grader.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back though, the Quaker school, how was that
                        run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was kindergarten and first and second grade. We had to go to
                    meeting and that's pretty hard when you're 4 and 5. You just sit there and be
                    quiet. Of course, we would scurry around under the pews and that sort of thing.
                    There was much suppressed giggling and whispering. We never quite absorbed the
                    spiritual part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you going to school when you first started in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: East Ward Public School on Foxhall just below Reservoir and
                    Foxhall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be so bad about it? At one point some of the
                        schools like Central High were really quite good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There must have been good schools. I had been in the public schools in
                    Pennsylvania. I had felt challenged and pushed and interested, and as much as
                    any kid enjoys school, had enjoyed it. In this school, there were no grades.
                    There was just good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory. I got all goods except
                    conduct, which was routinely unsatisfactory. I was on the safety patrol, which
                    was a big honor. Then the teacher kicked me off and put me back on and kicked me
                    off and put me back on. Maybe it was just that teacher, I don't know, but I
                    found it a total waste. My parents ponied up the money and sent me off to a
                    private school the next year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I went to Landon for 2 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I enjoyed it. It was good. And then we went overseas. My father
                    migrated through the Wriston Act into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '55, the Civil Service and the Foreign Service were
                        amalgamated. At school and even before, were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any books or authors that really grabbed
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. The one that I still remember vividly was Kenneth Roberts, the
                    stories of the revolution. Most of all, Oliver Wiswell. Up to then, I had had
                    the standard monochromatic view of American history: good guys, bad guys, no
                    variations. Here was a story about a Tory. That was a bad guy. That was defined.
                    Yet he was interesting, sympathetic, I began to understand what his problems
                    were, and he didn't seem much like a bad guy. I suddenly at age 10 or 11 learned
                    that history had gradations and these were real people out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hit on a book that was a book that really set me off
                        on history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I've been very interested in American history ever since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they start saying, “You know, in the colonies, 1/3
                        were independents, 1/3 were against, and 1/3 were indifferent.” But we only
                        get really the for independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The irony of that is that I have since married a woman who � her
                    family are loyalists who fled to Canada in 1776 and continued on to this day. We
                    go up almost every year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume they live in Ontario?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Actually, New Brunswick, which is where Benedict Arnold and a lot of
                    loyalists ended up for a time. We go up to this beautiful little port town
                    that's all loyalists, still flying British flags and you have tea cups of
                    Charles and Lady Di and all the trappings of Anglophilia are thick in this
                    little town. As a Virginian, every time, it takes a little adjusting to get used
                    to this. I consider myself a semi-native Virginian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your father go first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: He was there 3 years. I went to school in Switzerland, which was a
                    great experience. I really enjoyed it. It was fabulous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the Swiss education. You were a
                        teenager.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was 13. I did 3 years there. It was an international school run
                    without apologies for profit. It was called the School of Princes. While I was
                    there, we had the Aga Khan. We had Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia. We had
                    various Saudi sheiks. Just a smattering of royalty. We had the Shah of Iran's
                    heirs. In fact, my first year there, in the spring, the Shah came to visit with
                    then Queen Soroya, his first wife, who was the star of most of the European pulp
                    magazines. Every week or so, they'd have a picture of Soroya because she was
                    beautiful and glamorous, the Elizabeth Taylor of the late '50s. I had the
                    distinct pleasure of kicking her out of my room when I was stark naked. I had
                    just come back from swimming. I had taken off my bathing suit when the door
                    swung open and there was the headmistress and Queen Soroya and I took one step
                    and slammed the door on both of them. I didn't know who they were. Then my
                    neighbor said, “Do you know what you did?” I was not chastised for my rudeness.
                    It turns out I was in the Shah's old room. It was being shown?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you learning languages there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. It was conducted at least half in French. Of course, I learned
                    Vaudoise French, which any Parisian will tell you is hardly adequate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They ranged from excellent to awful. We had a chemistry class with the
                    headmistress's wife that if you were serious about chemistry, which I wasn't,
                    would probably have been hopeless. Fortunately, I wasn't and I didn't notice,
                    didn't care. Just get through it. It was pretty basic. But we had a crazy little
                    Italian who taught European history and geography who terrified most of the
                    students and I realized afterwards was an excellent teacher, one of the best
                    teachers I ever had. We were all scared of him, so we learned and we did it the
                    way he told us to do it. We did elaborate maps with colored pencils in India ink
                    and everything and I think learned a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you coming up short on American history?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had none. All my American history was Kenneth Roberts. There was
                    none whatsoever. But one great thing we did at that school is, the headmaster
                    was one of the 2 or 3 colonels in the Swiss army. There were no generals. It
                    meant that he had access to the government and to the army and he could arrange
                    things in Switzerland. So, every fall, we had a concours, a competition, whereby
                    the whole school was divided up into teams of 4 and we had a 5 day break over
                    All Soul's Day or one of the Catholic holidays in late October. The whole school
                    was divided up into teams of 4 and sent on what was a 4 or 5 day scavenger hunt
                    or treasure hunt all over the country. We'd have a 5 day railpass and about 80
                    francs, which was $40, barely enough to buy food for 5 days. You couldn't go
                    hole up in a hotel room and try to live off the allowance, although some tried.
                    We just galloped all over the country deciphering these elaborate clues. “At
                    12:00 on Wednesday, there will be a teacher at the railroad station at
                    Interlaken with the next clue.” That's what the last clue would tell you. If you
                    got there at 12:00, you got the next clue. If you got there 2 hours later, maybe
                    he was gone and you didn't get the next clue and you had to track where
                    everybody was going as soon as you saw any other students. So, I did that 3
                    years running. You couldn't do that today with terrorism and security concerns.
                    Nobody would let their kids run all over a country for 5 days completely
                    unsupervised. But it was glorious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine it was. Were you picking up at the school, what
                        was being taught about America? Was America a distant power? Were people
                        making remarks about America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was well before the? Nowadays, the American cultural presence is
                    overwhelming wherever you are. In remote African villages, you'll find “Michael
                    Jackson” painted on the side of a mud hut. How do they know about Michael
                    Jackson? Where did that come from? It penetrates. Then, this was not the case.
                    American movies were popular but not dominant. There were a lot of European
                    movies. American magazines weren't around at all. TV was still fairly early.
                    American sports were totally off the horizon because Europeans played soccer.
                    That was what was important. And we didn't. We didn't have any idea. That was
                    the 1958, the World Cup when Pele emerged as a 17 year old superstar from
                    Brazil. This was a huge deal in Europe. In America, nobody knew anything about
                    it. So, we were remote, not overpowering and not something that was much of a
                    topic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you go back to Lisbon on vacations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression of Portugal at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, very much so. That was the Portugal of Salazar, the dictator, and
                    it was a very quiet, well behaved, orderly little country. In vivid contrast to
                    Spain. You could drive across the border and in this dusty border town of
                    Badajoz in Spain, all the houses and the street and everything else was dusty
                    brown and the people were wildly colorful and carrying on and wearing very
                    colorful clothes. You crossed the border into Portugal, there was no dust
                    suddenly. The town was very neat and tidy. The houses were painted different
                    colors. But the people wore black and were totally subdued. You immediately knew
                    something had happened. It was a wonderful place to live as an outsider with
                    money, which we were by definition as an American diplomat's kid. It must have
                    been pretty stifling for the Portuguese and eventually 15 years later they
                    overthrew Salazar.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Lots. It was a totally international school.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Some. I visited a friend in Belgium and went to the World's Fair. And
                    some friends in Geneva, that sort of thing. And then several of them I stayed in
                    touch with in college.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in the cards for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I went to Harvard. Geographic distribution, I like to think, was a big
                    help. And I was coming from a school that had sent them Karen Agha Khan a year
                    earlier and Charam Pahlavi. It was a pretty flashy group Harvard was getting. I
                    was the unflashy one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever feel unflashy? Were you overwhelmed by

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, that was the strange thing about it. Because there were a lot of
                    fancy folks at the school, it was assumed that everybody was sufficiently fancy
                    even if you weren't and you were able to pass as fancy even if you were just a
                    homespun American government employee's kid. God knows that's not fancy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Harvard from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: 1960, then took a year off, and then graduated in '64. I spent that
                    year off in the Congo, my father's next assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Harvard, were you caught up in the election of
                        1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. I was. I remember the Pogo riots. Pogo was a famous comic
                    strip where the famous quote comes from “We have met the enemy and he is us.” It
                    was about animals in the Okefenokee swamps, but somehow they had politics as
                    animals. Harvard would have “I Go Pogo” campaigns as a rejection of the
                    political process. There was an I Go Pogo demonstration that turned into a mild
                    riot and got a lot of attention. But by the time the election came around, which
                    I guess was November 1960, I was in the Congo. We were watching the results on
                    the USIS ticker all night and it wasn't resolved and then Kennedy won. Then a
                    month or so later, we had a congressional delegation with a very young Senator
                    Frank Church. The staff aide was one Ted Kennedy. Ted Kennedy drew all the
                    attention and Frank Church didn't appreciate it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harvard in 1959, what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was still emerging from the Harvard of my father's era, the Harvard
                    very much of the northeast establishment, where most of the kids had gone to
                    prep school and most of the kids had come out of a pretty similar environment.
                    There was much more diversity. It was by now at least 50% high school from all
                    over. I remember vividly my first day talking to my neighbors in my dorm and
                    there were several Jewish kids from the Bronx High School of Science who were
                    frustrated because they hadn't gotten all 800s in everything in the college
                    boards. I'm thinking, “I hope they don't ask me what I got on the college
                    boards.” They had obviously been highly competitive in a highly competitive
                    environment. I felt kind of like I had slid in through the back door when I
                    found out about that. It was becoming the Harvard of today, a much more diverse,
                    competitive institution. But it still had some of the flavor of the old, the
                    final clubs and the old northeast elite establishment. I was somewhere in
                    between. I did come from a boarding school, but it was an overseas boarding
                    school, so it was weird. It didn't fit with their world and I didn't quite know
                    their world, nor did I know really the American high school world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling your freshman year about what you
                        wanted to study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. I absolutely knew I wanted to major in English until I found
                    out what majoring in English meant. I thought it just meant you read good books,
                    it meant you criticized good books endlessly. After one course, I thought this
                    is not what I want to do. Then I stumbled back into history and that's where I
                    ended up, modern European history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Congo when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: After freshman year, my grades were less than distinguished. In fact,
                    I was on the edge of flunking out and the dean said it would be a good idea if I
                    took a year off and thought about this and came back a little more serious. My
                    father had just gone as DCM in Leopoldville, this brand new embassy that was
                    opening up with independence June 30, 1960. So I decided I'd go spend some time
                    with him and see. While we were working that out, Leopoldville blew up and I
                    couldn't go until late August, by which point I had to make a decision about
                    whether I was going back to school or not and decided to take a year off. I
                    spent 3 months with him in Leopoldville working part-time with USIS doing things
                    like a Louis Armstrong concert. That was great fun. And that visit with Senator
                    Church and Ted Kennedy and company. And then USIS had run out of useful things
                    for me to do and I was teaching English in one of those English? USIS used to
                    have lots of English courses. I went over to the UN, which had by then set up,
                    and asked them for a job and was hired immediately as an interpreter for the
                    Third Nigerian Brigade in Albertville, North Katanga.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where your French came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. A little Lebanese guy named Shazoom or something like that said,
                    “Do you speak French?” I said, “Yes.” He spoke to me in French for 10 minutes
                    and said, “You'll do. Can you leave the day after Christmas?” I said, “I guess.”
                    The day after Christmas, I was sent off to northern Katanga.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go there, let's talk about Leopoldville. I
                        realize you were a college kid. What were you seeing there? One thinks about
                        the chaos that continues to be in the Congo today. What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was fascinating. That was where I developed my taste for African
                    crises for lack of a better phrasthe adrenalin rush and the excitement. Some
                    people are appalled by this. Some people hate it. Some people thrive on it. I
                    thrived on it. I liked it. We had Lumumba in his house down the street under
                    house arrest for a while. We had all sorts of characters around. I saw firsthand
                    coup attempts and the press corps and all the correspondents. We had a firefight
                    one night with a machine gunner in our backyard. I had to get by him through the
                    drainage ditches over to the ambassador's house because the ambassador wasn't
                    there and his children were. His German nanny spoke no French. So I got over
                    there and spent the night with them to make sure they didn't get in any trouble.
                    Throughout this firefight that went on all night over at the Ghanaian
                    ambassador, who was next door to him. That was fun to me. I found that very
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they fighting about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The Ghanaian ambassador working for Kwame Nkrumah had been very
                    actively supporting and working with the Lumumba faction. The government was
                    saying, “That's improper behavior for an ambassador. You must go.” He was PNGed.
                    He said, “I won't go unless my president tells me to go,” which is a direct
                    violation of traditional diplomatic discourse. When you're PNGed, you go. Well,
                    he wouldn't go. That would have been all right. They would have just bundled him
                    up and put him on a plane. But the UN then made what I still consider to be a
                    very serious mistake of sending some Tunisian troops up there to protect him.
                    That made it a challenge and the Congolese army deployed. Inevitably, somebody
                    started shooting and they shot at each other all night long until in the morning
                    they negotiated a settlement and the guy got on a plane and left. But in the
                    process, 4 or 5 Tunisians and 4 or 5 Congolese got killed for no reason
                    whatsoever other than just some bad judgment on all sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a place you could go around downtown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: You could still get around, yes. I remember going to a concert of the
                    Okay Jazz, which was still a great Zairian band when I got there as a Foreign
                    Service officer 25 years later. I remember there was a great restaurant at the
                    zoo, some discussion over where the meat came from. Yes, you could get around
                    some of the time. Some of the time it wasn't wise. But there would be
                    spasms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel at that time that being white was a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, there was absolutely no racism. It was intriguing. There was
                    anti-Belgium sentiment. If you could be mistaken for a Flamande, because they
                    had been the overseers largely, the people most in contact with African labor
                    and therefore the hated ones, and that was a great insult, “Sale Flamande.” If
                    in any way you were confused with the Flemish, you could be in trouble, get
                    beaten up, but probably not killed. But I never felt the slightest bit of racial
                    fear. Maybe I was just rather insensitive, but I never did. And I dealt with
                    Congolese every day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to Katanga. You were there in '61?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. I got to Albertville New Year's Eve 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Albertville was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: A little town on Lake Tanganyika, maybe 1,500 miles from Leopoldville.
                    Congo's huge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relationship between Albertville and
                        Stanleyville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: None except that the later Stanleyville problems of '64 and all that
                    with the sambas. It's where Kabila started. It was a wild rebel group that came
                    from northern Tanganyika. They went to Stanleyville and set up briefly, the
                    Simbas, and killed some people and eventually Belgian paratroopers went in and
                    put it down. When I was there, Stanleyville had been set up by Gizenga as, the
                    Marxist Lumumbist seceding province. Katanga was the conservative Belgian Union
                    Miniere seceding province led by Tshombe. The Kasais were somewhere in between,
                    also playing games. And the UN was trying to patch this Humpty Dumpty back
                    together again and ignore all the secessions or end them. I was working for the
                    UN as an interpreter in one part that was relatively? Well, it wasn't all that
                    quiet. There was the UN force. When I arrived an Irish brigade was just leaving
                    but I worked for the Nigerian brigade that was coming in to replace them. The
                    Katangese with the gendarmerie, led by white mercenaries, some wild characters.
                    They were in town. They were controlling the town and running around like
                    cowboys in jeeps that had machineguns mounted in the back. Then outside of town,
                    the Baluba, the tribesmen of northern Katanga, who were furious with this
                    southern Katanga insurrection and did not support it at all but didn't have any
                    weapons or much of anything, so whenever they got their hands on anybody, they
                    tended to commit violence upon them. Eventually, they tore up the railroad.
                    There were all these fights along the railroad. The Katangese were trying to
                    keep it open to serve the mines. Gradually the Baluba closed it. A number of Old
                    West fights were along the railroad line. With the UN trying to keep everybody
                    from killing each other without much success.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Q: Was it the Irish brigade that had some problems?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They had their first combat casualties in the history of independent
                    Ireland just before I arrived. As part of their sweeping up and moving out, they
                    were burying what was left and sending the bodies home and that sort of thing. A
                    patrol of 10 Irish soldiers had been taken by the Baluba, who didn't necessarily
                    know the difference between the UN and the Katangese gendarmerie, and there was
                    a fight and the most courageous of the Irish after the Balubas subdued them or
                    killed them was at least partially eatethat was a tradition to acquire the
                    courage of your most esteemed opponent. This was a sensation in Europe. Private
                    Anthony Brown was partially consumed, eaten in action as it were. That's black
                    humor, very black humor. The Irish were stunned. They had missed World War II.
                    They hadn't been in any wars. This was the first time the Irish army had
                    actually suffered wartime casualties, so it was a big deal. They packed up and
                    left but not before Near Year's Eve. I had just arrived. I had come into this
                    little town in northern Katanga in my madras jacket because my mother always
                    told me to wear a jacket when you're traveling and that's the only jacket I had,
                    and a tennis racket. I looked like I had just stepped out of space. They were
                    polite enough not to fall all over the ground laughing at me. I was accepted in.
                    That night, there was a Near Year's Eve party and some drinking. I was an 18
                    year old kid, trying to keep up. Naturally, at about 11:30, it was time to roust
                    the piper. Somebody got the piper up. This fairly well lubricated band of mostly
                    Irish and a few British officers with the Nigerian brigade marched through town
                    behind the piper in his undershorts and the question was, who were the savages
                    here? You know what bagpipes sound like in the middle of the night? I think we
                    were the primitives. God knows what the local populace thought this was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the Nigerian brigade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was still semi-British, a British commander, a British brigadier,
                    rosy cheeks. I can still remember, he would say, “Whacko” of things that he
                    approved of. A British brigade major and a few British junior officers and then
                    a Nigerian brigade major who sort of took on my godfather role. He really helped
                    me out. He was really nice. He later became Nigerian ambassador to London and
                    then died abruptly in the mid-'60s, I'm not sure what of. The Nigerian army at
                    that point was the pride of the British colonial system. They were very good,
                    very straight, very correct, and a lot of them, the officers I knew, I'm sure
                    later got into politics. The Nigerian army is actively engaged in Nigerian
                    politics until this day.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not well. They had no way to communicate, no common language. I was
                    translating African French to African English and the African French was easy.
                    It was the African English that I was struggling with. The Nigerian English is a
                    challenge.</p>

                    and sounds, it's quite creative and interesting English. There's nothing wrong
                    with it, but you're not used to it. That was a challenge. They had virtually
                    nothing in common. These were largely Sandhurst traineI was dealing with the
                    officers? The common soldiers might have had more village kinship. But I was
                    dealing with the officers and they tended to be Sandhurst- (end of tape)</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We, the UN force, were trying to manage this port town on the lake,
                    keep the peace, keep the Katangese from doing anything terrible to the Baluba,
                    keep the Baluba from doing anything terrible to the Katangese, and not doing a
                    great job at any of that because it was a problem that's still very much a
                    problem today and one that interests me enormously: how do you peacekeep when
                    you don't have clearly delineated lines and a setting where everybody
                    understands the rules? And we didn't. There were these mercenaries running
                    around town in these jeeps ready to shoot up anything they felt like shooting
                    up, including us. This Nigerian force that wasn't really expecting to engage in
                    outright combat. The Nigerians expect to present themselves, look good, and
                    everybody would behave, and everybody didn't. So, it was awkward. The town was
                    like a western movie. It was one long street of storefronts with the arcade in
                    the front and all the rest of it. It had everything but the gunfighters
                    swaggering down the sidewalk. Instead of horses, you had jeeps tied up with
                    machineguns in the back. It was amazing.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: I think he was British, but a lot of them were white South Africans.
                    But the ones I had, I had a Belgian, I had a Scottish mercenary who had been in
                    Malaysia, been with Castro in Cuba until, as he said it, he sold one of Raul's

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They were running around and getting into fights with the Baluba over
                    this rail line. They were trying to keep the rail line open. That was the key to
                    Kabalo and the mines and central northern Katanga. The idea was, you get the ore
                    out to the lake and you can ship it out, although in fact the rail line wasn't
                    staying open, the Baluba were shutting that, and not much was going on in the
                    port either.</p>

                    was starting at exactly the same time across the lake in Gombe in her mountains
                    with her chimpanzees just as I was over there with my Nigerian troops on the

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I spent most of my time working with the Katangese chief of police,
                    who was constantly arresting the UN forces, workers, for various infractions.
                    I'd have to go get them out of jail. That was a large part my job, and working
                    with the soldiers to organize refugee things. Periodically there would be waves
                    of Belgians and the like who would come in from somewhere else where things had
                    gotten out of hand and we'd put them up in the railroad cars. We had this big
                    railroad depot there.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: It was full of missionaries and that was a big deal for the embassy
                    trying to get them all evacuated. They had pretty much either gone or were off
                    in the bush where nobody was ever going to see them. I didn't have much contact

                    really see it at the time, but looking back on it, it was pretty clear that it
                    was a cardboard government pretty well set up by the Belgian mining interests to
                    protect their interests for the mines of southern Katanga, which they did.</p>

                    and the few people around town, business mainly. But gradually leaving as it
                    became increasingly clear that this wasn't going to get over quickly and things
                    were not going to go back to the way they were.</p>

                    months there, it was not running at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: For an 18 year old kid, it was great. I was paid real money. It was a
                    real job. I was working with all these Nigerian and British officers and lots of
                    Katangese officials in as remote a spot as you could probably find. It was
                    fascinating. I was sharing a little house with a Colombian accountant and down
                    the road was a Swiss accountant. They were doing the books for the thing. I
                    remember vividly one day when we stopped to pick up the Swiss on our way to the
                    office, which was in the old railroad station downtown, and he was outside his
                    door screaming and pointing at the house. There was a snake in there. I think
                    his servant and I went and dealt with the snake and restored peace. But the
                    Swiss was totally undone. There are not so many snakes in Switzerland. I don't
                    think he had ever been out of Switzerland before, so this was a shock to his
                    system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the Nigerian officer corps? Was

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They were kind of bewildered by this. It wasn't ideological. I do
                    remember being very suspicious. The top civilian at the UN there, my boss, was a
                    Czech named Berzac. I was enough of a Cold War kid to be very suspicious about
                    what was he really up to? As far as I know, he was just doing the job. There was
                    no indication he was up to much of anything. He worked with the British
                    general.</p>

                    truof Nigeria. They were just coming to independence. They were pulling the
                    country together and this huge, disparate country was going to be the powerhouse
                    of Africa and it was going to be great and all the rest of it. Sadly, it didn't

                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, definitely Christians and Muslims. The animist bit was pretty

                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, my father thought it would be a great experience and I guess he
                    must have persuaded my mother. I was writing letters home. If they were worried
                    or scared, they didn't tell me. That summer, at the end of 6 months in June, I
                    left, went back to Leopoldville. By this time, my father had left Leopoldville
                    and was in the confirmation process for the first ambassador to what was then
                    Dahomey, now Benin. I was going to meet him there. I got a ticket on a French
                    tramp steamer from Point Noire in the Congo to Dahomey, to Cotonou. I made my
                    way across the river on the ferry and took the train from Brazzaville down to
                    Point Noire, a great adventure, and got to Point Noire and presented myself at
                    the dock, and I wasn't on the passenger list. What am I going to do? I said,
                    “Can I look at that?” I looked over the list and I wasn't on there. I looked
                    over it really carefully and found Mme. Ebaine. My “Mc” had turned into Mme. and
                    the “Ilvaine” had turned into Ebaine and that was me. I finally persuaded the
                    guy that that was it. “But you're not Madame.” “Well, I think I am.” I finally
                    persuaded him and sure enough, I was seated on the captain's right as the only
                    unaccompanied female on board. Boy, was the captain disappointed! I spent 4 days
                    on this tramp steamer. I got to Dahomey and as it turned out my father got
                    tangled up in a dispute between Senator Clark of Pennsylvania trying to get more
                    appointees in the administration over something, so he was holding up
                    ambassadors and he held up my father for a few weeks and I got there before he
                    did and found the embassy in ruins because there was an admin officer who had
                    jaundice and there was a DCM who didn't know what to do and one or 2 others who
                    were sort of flailing around. The DCM didn't speak French for some reason. He
                    was in over his head. He hired me as a local employee. Everything was in
                    customs. So my first job as a local employee was to go talk to customs. I did. I
                    just went down and chatted with the African officials and they said, “Oh, okay,
                    now we understand” and everything was released. So I was a miracle maker. I was
                    a big hit. Then a couple of weeks later, my father showed up.</p>

                        there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: One of the Harvard professors who occasionally expounds on the world
                    and insecurity of the world was pointing out that there are 2 reasons for
                    failure in the world: location and government. Dahomey is location. There isn't
                    anything. The one thing they grew and produced in abundance was palm oil, which
                    everybody grew and produced in abundance. So, Dahomey is one of those places
                    that is a nice little country that probably should be a province of somewhere
                    else. It really doesn't have an economic raison d'etre. Despite that fact, it
                    then went through 15 years of coups and counter-coups. They supplied all the
                    French intellectuals, all the core “functionnaires” for French West Africa were
                    Dahomian. If you were from Dahomey and you got out, you got an education, you
                    got a job, you went to the French bureaucracy. You didn't stay in Dahomey
                    because there was nothing to do. So, with independence, with De Gaulle's great
                    pronouncement and everybody became independent at once in 1960/'61, all the
                    Dahomian “functionnaires” were sent home from Cote d'Ivoire and Chad and Niger
                    and Senegal and all the rest of it. So, suddenly, there's this little town on
                    the coast with very little economy and lots of “French” intellectuals. Those
                    that didn't get jobs with the UN spent the time overthrowing each other. So,
                    Dahomey had a nice long history of bloodless coups. They didn't kill each other.
                    They were very good about it until well into the '70s and '80s. Then it actually
                    has been recently successfully democratic for the last 10 or 15 years, better

                    was a sleepy little coastal backwater. It's where they filmed The Comedian, the
                    Graham Greene book, because it was the classic sleepy backwater. My wife
                    describes where I spent a large part of my life as “Graham Greenland” quite
                    appropriately. The places Graham Greene wrote about were never on the
                    mainstream.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It might have been. He was in Sierra Leone also. He was there as a
                    police officer during World War II. He wrote about the Congo.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The French were very much there. This was one of the countries that
                    had not said “No.” Only Guinea had said “No” to De Gaulle. The other West
                    African colonies that had said “Yes, with your guidance, we'll stay in the
                    metropole” and it was still very much part of the French world and the French
                    embassy was a big deal. To this day, an American embassy in most of those
                    countries, you work as closely as you can with the French and try to stay out of
                    their way and try to be helpful. They're the lead in most of those countries.
                    It's fragmented a bit and there's some changes in some places where that's no
                    longer true, but?</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. He did get there. He stayed 3 years, had a great time. I
                    stayed a month or 2 and then went back to college.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: My academic record did not improve enormously, but I realize now this

                <p>MCILVAINE: That thing the British had for several generations where they would
                    send you off fresh out of university to be a district officer in some
                    godforsaken place at the end of the world where you were king for 2 years. What
                    an experience. There's hundreds of memoirs. What a fabulous experience. Talk

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I certainly was much more ready to deal with it. When I had arrived
                    there originally from a small European school where I had done very little
                    writing in English and suddenly had papers due every time I turned around, I
                    didn't know how to write them and I was overwhelmed. It took me a while even to
                    realize that I was overwhelmed. But when I came back, I had a much clearer idea
                    of how to do it, how to deal with it, and how to get something out of it. Mind
                    you, this wasn't all put to what many would consider the most productive use in
                    that I became a member of the Harvard Lampoon and spent an awful lot of my time
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It's the oldest college humor magazine in the country. I had a great
                    time working with that. We did 2 national issues where we took over the entire
                    issue of Mademoiselle magazine in July. We'd go down in the spring and interview
                    models and pose model shoots in the “Mademoiselle” offices just as college kids.
                    This was a great deal. I got to escort Candy Bergen, who was then the hottest
                    young model around on one big fashion show. We had a great time. It was a
                    college kid's fantasy. We did a parody of Ian Fleming's James Bond books called
                    Alligator. We did a record that sold nationally called The Harvard Lampoon
                    Tabernacle Choir Sings at Leningrad Stadium. We had one guy who could turn any
                    piece of music on the piano into rock-n-roll and did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming with this African experience, particularly at that
                        time, Africa was pretty much the unknown continent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was the exciting new time when Africa was full of hope and
                    promise and it was turning independent all over the place. The Congo was a great
                    disaster.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The names all rang up and down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Did you see the Lumumba movie that was done a year or so ago?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was excellent and it really caught the flavor of Kinshasa. They
                    apparently filmed it in Harare, which still has the 1950s African colonial town
                    look. It felt right. It looked right. It was very good. And they were careful
                    not to take the? One of the things that happened with Lumumba was, immediately
                    with his death or even before he became a great Soviet Bloc martyr and was made
                    into an immediate cardboard character. The movie kept Lumumba as a real person
                    who was as he really was, overwhelmed by events. Suddenly the postmaster's clerk
                    got this huge, sprawling, disparate country to try and pull together and it's
                    splitting up in every direction and he doesn't know how to do it, nor did
                    anybody, nor could anybody figure that out. That comes through in the movie,
                    that he was overwhelmed by this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the university, in the best of all world's you
                        would have been a source.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I remember when Kenneth Kaunda came through and I went to see him.
                    This English lord had built this fantastic place way in northern Zambia. Then he
                    spent his time getting to know all the independence movement crowd and promoting
                    independence and being denounced by all his fellow settlers. The English lord
                    came with Kaunda, the young African firebrand with hair that stood up straight
                    like Don King's. That gave Kaunda a respectability and an acceptability to the
                    West that he wouldn't have had otherwise. I remember him doing a lecture at one
                    of the halls at Harvard. It was very well attended, a big crowd. But I didn't
                    use my African experience. Looking back on it, I could have made much more of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense at the university there was much of an
                        African studies movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, there was nothing. That just didn't exist. In fact, I remember
                    trying to twist things so I could derive a paper or 2 out of my African
                    experiences. You really had to stretch and maneuver to do it. It was a bit of a
                    reach. There was no African program whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the academic world it takes a long while? It's pretty
                        conservative. They don't take new experts lightly or at all if they can help
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What were you taking at Harvard?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I migrated into modern European historFrench Revolution to World War
                    I. I got very fascinated, very interested, in the era of the late 1800s, the
                    decadence that took over Europe and led straight to an era of total unreality.
                    Barbara Tuchman wrote the book a few years later that I would have written had I
                    been a true academic.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. It was an excellent book and I was noticing the same thing but
                    wasn't smart enough or diligent enough or whatever it took to write a book and
                    sell iand she did. That was intriguing to me, the collective psyche in European
                    government, the major powers all went off into Bunnyland for 10-15 years until
                    the world came crashing down around them in 1914.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any professors who particularly stick out in

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. Crane Britton, one of the stars, perhaps the leading expert on
                    the French Revolution. He was fascinating, all the intricacies and ins and outs
                    of that 10 year extravagance that France went through. Marcus Cunliffe, an
                    English history professor who was on an exchange and again did the same thing
                    that Kenneth Roberts did. He was doing American history and he was suddenly
                    talking about all these peoplLincoln, Washingtoas human beings with real flaws
                    and weaknesses and problems. That was still startling to me, that you could talk
                    that way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I remember vividly the Cuban Missile Crisis, as I guess most of my
                    generation do. I remember the progressive building of tension. I remember seeing
                    guys shoving stuff in their car and taking off and going to Canada because “This
                    place is going to blow up probably in a few hours.” I somehow didn't get the
                    right sense of panic. I didn't pack, I didn't run, I didn't go anywhere. But
                    there definitely was a sense that the end might very well be nigh. That was
                    1962.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you thinking of the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I wasn't really. I'm embarrassed to say I don't think I was thinking
                    very much of anything. I was having a good time. It was a time when it was
                    understood that when you got out of college you dealt with the military. The
                    Vietnam draft hadn't really started but the draft was there and you either were
                    drafted and probably sent to Germany or you went to officers candidate school or
                    you went to ROTC or you had a deferment and you went to graduate school. It was
                    pretty clear that academia was not my natural environment and I wasn't going to
                    go to graduate school, so I would have to deal with the military. I joined Army
                    ROTC in order to get that done. I enjoyed that. One of my platoon mates and
                    later friends was Lionel Rosenblatt, who created Refugees International.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of a place like Harvard towards
                        ROTC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was not at that point hostile, although I must have been pretty
                    near the last known graduate of Harvard ROTC. A couple of years after I left,
                    they had the big anti-war demonstrations and Harvard ROTC was closed. But at
                    that point, Vietnam was still a cloud on the horizon, not a whole black sky. The
                    buildup started the year after I got out of college, 1965. That's what really
                    galvanized the anti-war movement. The anti-war movement existed. We had at that
                    point the early days of the beatnik movement, not even hippies yet. I remember
                    the room underneath mine freshman year was furnished by 2 cots and the pieces of
                    a shattered 12 string guitar and slept anywhere from none to 25 people at any
                    given night. It was a couple of kids very closely tied in to the local Beat
                    community which at that point included the Club 24 Mount Auburn Street and a
                    young coffeehouse singer named Joan Baez. Of course, 12 string guitars were a
                    big part of it. So that was coming. Marijuana was just showing up. You began to
                    hear about it and people were just beginning to experiment. No other drugs. The
                    only other choice was still alcohol and beer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned ROTC shutting down, which was a sad thing
                        that happened that now none of the major good schools other than state-run
                        schools have ROTC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I thought I saw or heard something indicating that there was a way to
                    do it. For many kids, the navy particularly gave you a full scholarship. So, it
                    was a really good way to get your college tuition paid. Of course, you had to
                    give the navy 4 or 5 years in exchange. But even with the army, you got a little
                    money and a little help. If you were going to have to deal with the military
                    anyway, which in that generation you were, it was a relatively easy way to do
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1964.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I immediately went to summer camp at Fort Devins, Massachusetts and
                    started in as a second lieutenant in the United States Army and went to Fort
                    Benning, Georgia for infantry officers training, and then Fort Holabird,
                    Baltimore in the slums of BaltimorDundalfor intelligence school.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I wanted to go overseas. In fact, I wanted to go to Vietnam. I learned
                    from the Congo that what you read in the press didn't give you a very accurate
                    picture of what was going on. I admit, I wasn't a very aware 21 year old. I
                    seemed to have missed an awful lot of the civil rights movement, for example.
                    But I did know that Vietnam by that point was going to be a defining event for
                    my generation and I knew that reading the press accounts would give you a very
                    garbled picture from my Congo experience. I still remember David Halbertstam,
                    rookie New York Times reporter, writing one of these “Fear Stalks the Streets of
                    Leopoldville” articles on the week when fear most definitely did not stalk the
                    street. It was the one week where there was no fear and everybody was relaxed
                    and decided to take a week off. But he had nothing to write. He had to write
                    something, so it was “Fear Stalks the Streets of?” I wanted to see Vietnam for
                    myself. I wanted to make my own judgment on what this was and whether this was
                    the massive thing it was beginning to seem to be and how we should be dealing
                    with it. So I was trying to go there. There was no way they were going to send a
                    rookie second lieutenant to Vietnam. At this point they were sending advisors
                    and they were only more seasoned officers. So, I was assigned to a military
                    intelligence company at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which, as near as I could
                    see, would be painting rocks white. So I talked to everybody I could find,
                    prowled the Pentagon trying to get an assignment to Europe without success until
                    just before it was time to go, I went in one of these huge personnel bays at
                    Fort Holabird, a giant room with lots of desks and spec 4s and sergeants sitting
                    there moving papers, and found the right sergeant and said, “Look, I speak
                    French. I could be useful in Europe. Why can't I go to Europe?” He said, “You
                    speak French? Go to this room and take the test.” So I go upstairs to this room
                    and take the test and they say, “Yes, he speaks French.” I come back and he
                    said, “Tell you what: I'll reassign you to Europe.” I said, “Great! Where have
                    you been all my life?” Sure enough, the sergeant reassigns me to Europto the
                    Czech border of Germany. Go figure. Did I say I spoke German?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to the army language school and took Russian. I ran

                <p>MCILVAINE: The army logic, it's inescapable.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>But there was a French armored platoon patrolling with the Americans on that
                    stretch of border, so I actually found some Frenchmen to talk to, but I'm not
                    sure he knew that. It worked. I got to Europe. I spent 6 months on the Czech
                    border. Wonderful job. Basically you had these 3 young military intelligence
                    officers in civilian clothes talking to the German security agencies. Our only
                    real job was to screen the bad guys coming across the border so that those
                    behind heard before we were swallowed. We were 5 miles from the border in this
                    little farming town where in the spring the smell of manure was overpowering.
                    Then we had a ready room in this little room in the basement, each one of us
                    with our steel pot and our fatigues and our M14 rifle and all the rest of it. Of
                    course, even we knew enough to know that would be useless. What we needed were
                    lederhosen, Bavarian hats, and Czech flags to wave to the conquering heros as
                    they came through. We weren't going to get out. So, 6 months there, and then I
                    was pulled back to the headquarters in Stuttgart and I spent a year at the
                    headquarters in Stuttgart. But it gave me a chance to drive all over Germany and
                    a lot of Europe that I hadn't seen, a lot of Austria. I got up to Scandinavia
                    and did a lot of tourism. Every weekend I took off to get out of Armyland and
                    get into the real world. After 2 years, I got out as quickly as I could. Oh, and
                    I also took the Foreign Service exam while I was in Munich. Somewhat to my
                    surprise, I passed. When I got out, I came back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out in '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. I came back and eventually took the orals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions asked on the
                        orals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not the first time I took them. I took them twice. I don't that time.
                    I do remember that it was set up to intimidate you with a table, 3 glasses, 3
                    notebooks, 3 pencils, 3 chairs, and 3 grownups, and in front of them one little
                    table, one notebook, one pencil, and the victim. The whole point was to see if
                    they could fluster you and see how you handled it. That's all I really remember
                    about it. That and sitting outside afterwards because they came out within 15
                    minutes and told you whether you were in or out. That was quite a 15 minutes.
                    They told me I was in. Then I waited around. By then, the buildup had started.
                    Everybody was going to Vietnam. There was no question. As soon as I finished the
                    A100 course, I and most of my colleagues were going to Vietnamese language
                    training and off to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, was that the time when they were saying,
                        “You realize that if you join, you have to go anywhere, including

                <p>MCILVAINE: I wanted to go to Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was you're A-100 group like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Pretty homogenous. Very few women. I don't remember any blacks,
                    Asians, nothing exotic. Pretty whitebread. The one thing I remember about it is,
                    I may be one of the very few Foreign Service officers who has never been to
                    ConGen Rosslyn and never issued a visa. When we'd finished the 6 weeks and were
                    ready to do the 2 week visa course, the '67 war broke out. Lyndon Johnson called
                    Dean Rusk and said, “Dean, what's this I see on ABC about Sadat said this?” Dean
                    said, “Huh? What” and was deeply embarrassed. Then as soon as the President hung
                    up, Rusk said get me somebody watching all 3 networks at all times and reporting
                    directly to me so that I know what the President's talking about before he calls
                    me up.” And so they grabbed the 3 most junior officers in the entire Foreign
                    Service, 3 of us out of the A-100 course, put us in a little room in the
                    Department with 3 televisions and 4 radios. Fortunately, in those days, there
                    were only three networks. We watched and reported 3 times a day directly to the
                    Secretary what the news reports were on the Mideast. Abba Eban was speaking at
                    the UN. There was stuff going on every minute. It was a fascinating start. We
                    also watched The Dating Game and assorted other things. A very strange beginning
                    to my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Then as soon as that was over, we went off to Vietnamese language training in
                    what we called the “yellow submarine,” the basement of Arlington Towers all
                    painted yellow where we made these really weird sounds for days at a time. It
                    felt very strange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do with Vietnamese? You say “Hi” in 5
                        tones.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It took months and they understood this. It took months for everybody
                    who comes out of our background, normal Western background, to get comfortable
                    with the tones and get so you instinctively understood them and said them right,
                    or close enough. Then once you got to that point, the language was quite
                    straightforward. There was no complicated grammar or anything else. For the past
                    tense, you just put in the little word that said it was past tense. For the
                    future, you put in a little word that said it was future. You didn't change
                    verbs or any of the rest of that stuff, thank God. But it was still hard because
                    everything in vocabulary was totally alien. You really had to memorize every bit
                    of it. Nothing was familiar. Nothing clicked. So, for a couple of months, you
                    felt like a total idiot. You were in a room, 3 or 4 of you, with these little
                    Vietnamese teachers drilling you, making these weird sounds in all different
                    tones and correcting you. It was a strange experience. And then that lasted? I
                    was in language course at the end of '67. After the Tet Offensive a group of
                    others were pulled out and sent over early in 1968. Lionel Rosenblatt was my
                    housemate at the time. We were sharing a house off Dupont Circle. That was
                    interesting because of course in early '68 the whole world went to hell in a
                    handbasket in a hurry. There was the Tet offensive, Bobby Kennedy's
                    assassination, and then Martin Luther King's assassination. I can remember
                    walking out of Arlington Towers on a clear day in the spring and looking over at
                    Washington and seeing the smoke rising from my neighborhood. The Martin Luther
                    King riots? I couldn't get home. There was a National Guard checkpoint blocking
                    my house, wouldn't let me in. So, I retreated to rural Virginia until it was
                    over. We were essentially one block from the bad zone where the rioting was bad.
                    It was a truly awful year, 1968. Each time you thought it can't get any worse,
                    it did. The Prague Spring, the assassinations, everything.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the Chicago convention, by this time, the
                        anti-Vietnam movement was strong.</hi>

                <p>MCILVAINE: Most of my friends and acquaintances were in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I told them what I told myself, which is what I believed at the time,
                    that I had to see it myself. I wanted to know what was going on. They would
                    argue, “Yes, but you're actively supporting a dead policy.” Well, I didn't buy
                    the argument that everything we were doing was wrong. I thought the basic
                    premise that we should help the country avoid being taken over by force was
                    reasonable. Once I had been there nearly 2 years and come back, the first thing
                    I was persuaded of is that the government we were backing had no credibility
                    with the Vietnamese people whatsoever and therefore that would not work. That
                    was never going to work. It would stay afloat only as long as we could prop it
                    up and when we left it would collapse, and it did. I also, unlike most in the
                    anti-war movement, came away even more persuaded than before that the other guys
                    were also bad guys and that they had no virtue that I could see except that they
                    were better organized and better disciplined than the guys on our side. I was in
                    a province where I worked basically with villages, convinced that the victims in
                    this were most of the Vietnamese people, particularly the rural people, who were
                    being preyed on by both sides. I pretty well committed myself to doing whatever
                    I could and finding whatever means I had to help protect them from both sides,
                    not just the other side. I was working long and hard to protect my villages from
                    predatory district chiefs and corruption and government abuse as much as I was
                    from the VC. But it was a fascinating time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I arrived right after the Tet offensive in June of '68. I left just
                    before the Cambodian invasion in the spring of '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was a province advisor in Camau, the southernmost province in the
                    whole country in the Mekong delta. It was the province where the Viet Minh
                    originally started, but it never really had the main force war. It was still
                    very much a war of hamlet squad against hamlet guerrilla squad, and mortars,
                    ambushes, not giant main force battles. We didn't have any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of organization were you coming into in that

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There were 2 American USAID civilians because I was detailed to the
                    CORDS program, so I was essentially USAID detailed to the province advisory
                    team, which was all American military. We were the only ones who spoke
                    Vietnamese. There was a team of 30 or 40 American military outside the province
                    headquarters in a little tented compound on raised flats. They had all these
                    little walkways over the mud. Then they had district teams of 4 or 5 in each
                    district, or each district we could get to. Some of the districts we could never
                    get to. We were the only Vietnamese speakers, so we basically had a free hand to
                    deal with the whole civilian side of government. They were just dealing with the
                    military issues. We worked with all the province officials on land use,
                    agriculture, school building, everything, development issues. We were given a
                    free reign and no supervision. John Paul Vann was running things in the IV Corps
                    at that time. That was very exciting. There was a senior official that you heard
                    about and read about actually coming down and asking you what you thought.
                    Unheard of in those days, that a senior official would actually ask you and
                    listen to what you said. That was part of the legend of John Paul Vann, that he
                    really did listen to people. So, it was again like my Congo experience. The
                    intensity of a war environment where any mistake can get somebody killed. You do
                    the wrong thing at the wrong time, it's not just a mistake, it could be fatal. I
                    thrive on that. It seems to be something I really liknot all the time, but for
                    spurts. So I very much enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>In Vietnam a village would be up to 24 hamlets and 10-15,000 people. I worked
                    with 3 villages that I could reach from the capital by sampan or whatever where
                    I found village chiefs who seemed to be reasonably interested in actually
                    helping their people rather than helping themselves. I would do whatever I could
                    to help them.</p>
                <p>I also got into all sorts of interesting adventures. I'd be very careful to take
                    a sampan out without any advance warning, without telling anybody where I was
                    going or when, and just go down to the market and pick at random one of the
                    sampans and take off. You wouldn't tell them where you were going until you got
                    out of town. All the precautions you had to take. I carried a Swedish submachine
                    gun that I got from the CIA Phoenix Program, borrowed. It was a strange time.
                    We'd get mortared 2-3 times a week. The town would get mortared.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: “Please leave us alone. Everybody leave us alone.” This was the Mekong
                    delta, where the living was good in any kind of peace. It was all paddy land.
                    The whole province, 2 feet above sea level was about the highest point. Going
                    upstairs was a big deal. They had rice paddies and a cyclical life where you
                    plant the rice, the rice grows, you harvest the rice, and then you have 3 months
                    of drinking until it's time to plant the rice again. Because it was perfect rice
                    growing country and there was always plenty of water in the Mekong, they always
                    lived well until the war in these villages. Further up in the bush, in the more
                    jungle portions, there was real support for the Viet Cong, but there was no
                    support for the Viet Cong in my area. Increasingly, there was no support for the
                    government either. The government simply preyed on them. It took. It didn't
                    give. It didn't provide anything except maybe through us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much feeling of dealing with the government
                        officials about the problems you were mentioning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. There were a few. There was a refugee chief who seemed to be
                    trying to do his best. You always wonder afterwards who was really working for
                    the VC who had another line out. Nobody posted a scorecard after it was all over
                    saying, “Fooled you. This guy wasn't and this guy was.” But some of them were
                    obviously adventurers just making a buck. Those guys you tried to cut out and
                    keep out of whatever you were doing. Some of them were trying to do the right
                    thing within the limits of the system they worked in and you tried to figure
                    that out. But it was an intense experience for a 23-25 year old to try and
                    understand the pressures they were under.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any classic conflicts between
                        calling a province chief “corrupt” and the people above you not being very
                        happy with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No. The thing I remember as most interesting was the portable rice
                    mills, a really vivid explanation of what was going on. One of the things that
                    kept coming up in this village that I most enjoyed working with was that they
                    had to take all their rice to the one rice mill in the province capital run by a
                    Chinese businessman, pay the fixed price, and get their rice milled there. About
                    the same time, I heard about these little Honda portable rice mills. I found out
                    USAID had some, so I got them to send me one. I took it down to the village and
                    said, “Let's try this.” It was a smash success. The village set it up and
                    everybody was bringing their rice and waiting in line hours to get their rice
                    milled. They did it because they didn't have to take the rice to the province
                    and pay the province price.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Well, in short order, the rice mill was confiscated by the province government
                    and the national government issued an edict banning portable rice mills. I hit
                    right at somebody's rice bowl. This was a national thing. Monopolies on rice
                    mills were set up. It was bought, it was paid for, and it was not to be messed
                    with. This kid had screwed it up and boy did they shut that down as fast as they
                    could. That was illuminating.</p>
                <p>Then after a year of working in the delta, I was pulled back to Saigon and spent
                    9 months working for a little office called the Pacification Studies Group in
                    MACV headquarters that Colby had set up under Craig Johnston, who later became
                    ambassador to Algeria and a few other things. He had about 8 or 10 Vietnamese
                    speaking junior officers and 8 or 10 ex-Viet Minh Vietnamese, Chu Hoi, and the
                    idea was that Colby would say to Craig: “Something's going wrong in Province Y,
                    but the reporting's not giving a very clear picture and maybe they're covering
                    something up. I don't know what's going on. Can you find out?” A team would be
                    sent out. We would pair. We'd get to the province airstrip and the Vietnamese
                    Hoi Chan would disappear into the Vietnamese community and I'd go deal with all
                    the American officials and then I'd deal with the Vietnamese officials. Two or 3
                    days later, we'd meet and compare notes and see what we figured out was really
                    going on. I loved it. It was being an investigative reporter, which is something
                    I've always liked. I was good at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you finding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There was always 3 levels of stories below the official story. I
                    remember different trips. I would write these 2 page things to Colby that did
                    explain what the real problem was. There was always something. Unfortunately, I
                    can't remember a good example. You have to understand the relationship between
                    the province chief and the senior American advisors and the province chief and
                    his family and maybe the Chinese or whoever else. In one case it was the
                    community of Catholic refugees that had come down and settled in my old province
                    in Camau off in the corner and built their own little Catholic enclave and how
                    they were dealing with the provincial government. Another one was in III CORPS
                    in Ben Hua. I got all over the country. I got to see places I hadn't seen. I
                    remember Street Without Joy that Bernard Fall wrote about. It was the first time
                    I had ever gotten up into the north, into the big war country. It really
                    expanded my understanding of Vietnam and the problem. Those people were so
                    bitter. It was the delta taken 10 times worse. They had been tramped on and
                    killed and shot at by both sides over and over and over again and they hated
                    everybody. The hostility rang out at you from people along that stretch on the
                    coast. They had just been through it too many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across any problems of Americans getting
                        involved in corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I didn't. We always admired the wheeler-dealers. In Camau, we cornered
                    the market in VC flags. We had most of them. They were very good trading
                    material. I remember one NCO who managed to trade a VC flag for this giant
                    generator that was too big and he couldn't get it into the province and if he
                    had, we didn't know what to do with it. It would have electrified the whole
                    province. But he couldn't pass up the deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There you would have been part of the young FSO
                        mafia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. I'd get up to Saigon for a weekend. Many of the future stars of
                    the Foreign Service were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were there, what feel did you get about whither
                        Vietnam by the judgment of the young officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I think it was almost universal that this was going wrong. We were
                    there?. After the Tet offensive, there was a lull. The VC had really been
                    knocked back. So, for a while there, things looked like they were really moving.
                    But if you were working at the grassroots level, you came away with the
                    impression that the guys on our side are hopeless, that if this is what we've
                    got to work with, it isn't going to work. I think that was widespread with the
                    guys who went to language class with me and went out to districts at the same
                    time I did. We would meet back in Saigon. Higher up, those who went to the big
                    jobs in MACV and provincial headquarters might have been a little more
                    optimistic. The embassy seemed to be on a totally different plane. I had one
                    friend from the A-100 course at the embassy for a while. It was like they
                    weren't in the same country.</p>
                <p>I don't think I ever even got in the door of the embassy. USAID I and II and all
                    those places, yes, but I don't think I ever got in the door of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My consular section was an adjunct. I was consul general.
                        It sounds fancy, but we were dealing with consular matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Which were plenty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: And they weren't interested in your views on policy. The embassy did
                    have a reputation of being very closed to the outside world.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember looking at the diplomatic list. Here I was,
                        consul general, which sounds fancy. I made the upper half of the American
                        diplomatic list by one. There was something like 80 people on that
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They had so many bigshots.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Double ambassadors and all the rest of it. That embassy did not serve
                    our government well, I'm afraid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the pressures on it were such that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, nobody wanted to hear?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the presidents on down, it was sort of an impossible
                        situation. I think this is a good place to stop. You left there in the
                        spring of 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had been working with the Vietnam Special Studies Group, which was a
                    little group of junior officers put together by Elliot Richardson's staff when
                    he was Deputy Secretary. It included Lionel Rosenblatt and John Marks who later
                    founded Search for Common Ground. They got to be friends. Lionel already was a
                    friend because we had shared a house. John Lionel came out to Vietnam on this
                    NSC study group to determine what would happen if there was a cease-fire,
                    province by province, who would win, who would lose, who would go where, what
                    would happen. Our little group took them around and I particularly had a lot to
                    do with them. Then I went back to Washington and, as my first Foreign Service
                    officer job, got assigned to that, so again it wasn't a real Foreign Service
                    job. We set up in a corner of the Operations Center and worked all hours of the
                    day and night writing NSC papers on provinces in Vietnam and what we should do.
                    We wrote papers for Richardson's staff on other issues and did a paper when the
                    talk started about invading Cambodia. We did a paper on what would happen if you
                    did invade Cambodia to accomplish these missions. We concluded that the missions
                    would not be achieved. We wrote, “You will not get Viet Cong headquarters
                    because it will move before you got there.” We analyzed all the other U.S.
                    military operations to get Viet Cong headquarters. We had done the research and
                    we were very proud of it. We turned it in and about 2 days later the U.S.
                    invaded Cambodia with exactly those missions (at least officially) and, of
                    course, didn't achieve the missions and acquired a client state.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>That pretty much did it for me. Tony Lake, who was then on the NSC staff,
                    resigned. The 3 of us went to our boss and said, “We think we ought to resign
                    over this. They obviously aren't paying any attention to us. This we think is a
                    bad mistake.” He said, “They'd be delighted if you resigned. They'd be pleased
                    to get rid of you. I think you're of more use staying around and saying these
                    things.” Grump, grump, grump. So, we didn't resign. Basically we all went off.
                    Lionel went off and later, when Saigon was falling, did his great rescue with
                    Craig Johnston, where they got lots of Vietnamese they had worked with out of
                    Saigon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ______________ Secretariat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I took a year's leave of absence in 1971 which eventually turned into
                    a resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pick this up next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is October 8, 2003. Where were you getting stuff from?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There were 3 of us: Steve Cummings, Lionel Rosenblatt, and me. I left
                    the Foreign Service and then came back 10 years later. We were working under
                    Charlie Cook, Elliot Richardson's staff assistant. Elliot Richardson was Under
                    Secretary of State. We were installed in a corner of the Ops Center. We were
                    getting all the intelligence. That was fascinating. At least 2 of uCummings and
                    spoke Vietnamese and had worked in the provinces. Lionel worked in the capital.
                    The CIA agent reports, reading what Vietnamese said, were very useful. You knew
                    where the Vietnamese was coming from and what biases he was likely to reflect.
                    You could read it accordingly and make your own judgment as to how useful it
                    was. The State analysis was less useful because we didn't agree or figured that
                    the State analysts, who presumably were Saigon bound, just didn't have the same
                    feel for the provinces. Cummings and I both traveled extensively all over
                    Vietnam and thought we had a pretty good feel. Of course, we were also about
                    25/26 years old and knew everything. But it was an education into how valuable
                    intelligence is and how it can mislead you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the military intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I'm sure we got that, the DIA stuff. There were tons and tons of order
                    of battle stuff. That's what they like. That's what they do, which we weren't
                    interested in. I don't remember it being particularly useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The CIA reports that were unanalyzed we found the most useful. We
                    could figure out roughly who the source was or what segment of society the
                    source came out of and therefore what that source reflected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they coming to you unanalyzed? There is often the
                        problem that stuff comes in and then it goes through the hands of an
                        analyst, who is often just bringing their own biases and perspective into
                        it, which sort of vitiates the whole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Later when I was dealing with West Africa just 5 years ago, that was
                    very much the case. We weren't getting much of the raw stuff and the analysis
                    was poor. But it's a difficult field. Either you don't have enough information
                    to really figure out what's going on or you have too much and you don't know
                    what to pick from. I have a great deal of sympathy for the much beleaguered
                    intelligence analysts who are always blamed for everything. “Why didn't you tell
                    us?” The current Agency bias, at least it was before 9/11, was to warn you of
                    everything often so it couldn't be said, “You didn't tell us something awful
                    would happen.” That proved almost as defeating as?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Vietnam watching the news reportABC, NBthey

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Are we talking about the Vietnam Special Studies Group?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was fascinating and frustrating, fascinating in that we felt like
                    we were on the edge of the policymaking process and at the center of what was
                    going on, meeting with the NSC and young NSC staffers like Tony Lake. We felt
                    like we were in the center and then we learned quite abruptly that we weren't.
                    We were assembled to do a study of what would happen if there was a cease-fire,
                    province by province, what would happen in each province. Then once we did that,
                    we recognized that there was increasing talk of an invasion of Cambodia. We
                    thought that was a bad idea but we quickly did a study of 3 previous military
                    efforts to capture Viet Cong headquarters. We were very proud of that. We proved
                    definitively that you could capture the headquarters but you wouldn't capture
                    any people; they'd be gone. You would get a lot of material and it would not
                    seriously damage the North Vietnamese ability to prosecute the war. We finished
                    the paper, sent it up the chain. A day or 2 later, the United States invaded
                    Cambodia to go after Viet Cong headquarters. That was a profoundly disappointing
                    and frustrating turn of events. We thought it was a big mistake. We thought that
                    the only permanent result of it would be, we would acquire another client state.
                    We were frustrated that nobody even thought to look at this paper before they
                    did the job, or to ask. That was where our innocence was lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for where Elliot Richardson was in
                        this whole business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We felt certainly that he was listening to us. We don't know what he
                    said at NSC meetings but we did certainly get the conclusion that Kissinger and
                    maybe a few people at the Defense Department were making the policy decisions
                    and the State Department was pushed out to one side, not in the mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an equivalent group over at the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not that I know of. There may have been, but not that we dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't a young Vietnam vet officer mafia of the CIA,
                        State, and Defense getting together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Later, some of that emerged. There was Sam Adams, the VC counter at
                    the CIA who was later profiled in a big “60 Minutes” thing, made quite a fuss.
                    There was discontent throughout the national security bureaucracy and a lot of
                    questioning of this policy decision. But we weren't in contact. We weren't
                    linked. We didn't know each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Then we separated and split up. Steve Cummings decided to go to
                    medical school. I decided to take a year's leave of absence, instead of an
                    assignment to be a proper junior officer in Cameroon. I decided I really needed
                    to spend some time here to learn about my American roots rather than going back
                    overseas. And I admit I didn't much want to be a junior officer going to the
                    ambassador's receptions and serving the hors d'oeuvres, which is what I thought
                    it would be. Actually, it probably would have been quite a good job. But I
                    definitely wanted to spend some time at home, particularly in Virginia. So I
                    took a year's leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: From late '70/early /71. After the year's leave without pay, I
                    resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused you to resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I went out to an unheated cabin in the Virginia countryside with a
                    friend of mine, also a Vietnam vet, and we attempted to write something that
                    winter, sort of a Vietnam novel. It was good catharsis for us. It wasn't much of
                    a novel. We had lived a very intense experience in Vietnam. He was another guy
                    who had been through the course, spoke Vietnamese, and worked at a district
                    level. We had been involved in this life and death thing and we came back to
                    find a country just sort of motoring on, not very interested in Vietnam, and we
                    thought they should be more interested. So, we were definitely out of step with
                    our peers, with the society we were in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right now there are thousands of people your age who are
                        going around living up their great moments which consisted of sitting in
                        front of the Pentagon and chanting about LBJ. The anti-war movement? If
                        worst came to worst, you might get doused with a water cannon. Here you
                        were, out of this. In a way, you were being somewhat a subscriber to the
                        cause, but there must have been a great gap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There was a great gap. Many of my friends were at the demos, many of
                    the people I grew up with. But I had a great deal of respect for those young men
                    who faced the draft or went to Canada as opposed to those who took the easy way
                    out, which was “I'll just go to grad school and avoid the whole thing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are now our politicians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Right. I recognize that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some went into the National Guard and flew airplanes
                        briefly in Texas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Right. Those who really made a choice between jail, Canada, or the
                    draft because they thought it was unconscionable, I had a good deal of respect
                    for that. And there are a number who really disrupted their lives and went and
                    lived overseas and started over because they didn't want any part of that. That
                    was fine. I didn't have much respect for those who just used graduate school or
                    the National Guard, as a way to slip by what was a decisive moment for my
                    generation. In my generation, the men had to decide what to do about Vietnam.
                    You had to make a decision, even if it was graduate school or the National
                    Guard. You had to deal with it somehow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do with yourself? Was your resignation
                        acknowledged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No press play. I didn't tie it explicitly to Vietnam. I said I wanted
                    to learn more about myself and my country, which was true. I was recovering from
                    a case of hepatitis that I picked up in Mexico or Central America in 1972 and
                    splitting wood at my parent's farm in rural Virginia when my mother said, “I'm
                    going to the nominating caucus for the state convention at the firehouse. Do you
                    want to come?” I said, “Sure.” Up to that point, I wasn't a registered anything.
                    I was a Foreign Service officer politically neutral at least in theory. I went
                    to the Plains firehouse and I was the 21st person to arrive and we were split
                    evenly 10 to 10 between the Byrd Machine conservative Democrats and this new
                    upstart National Democrat effort to take over the Virginia party and line it up
                    with the National Democratic Party instead of the conservative Democratic Party
                    that it had been. I aligned with the National Democrats. We carried the day. We
                    elected the 3 delegates to the state convention. I was one of them. So, suddenly
                    I found myself in politics. I spent that spring of '72 in the organizing effort
                    to take over the state Democratic Party that was aligned with the McGovern
                    people. I went to the state convention in Roanoke and indeed we won. We took
                    over the state party and elected the McGovern delegates, whereupon most white
                    Virginians left the Democratic Party and we lost elections for the next 10 years
                    with me participating in a number of them. Then later I was actually the
                    Virginian in the state McGovern-Shriver campaign headquarters. We had 2 guys
                    from out of state sent in after me. We got 30% of the vote, which putting the
                    best spin on it, was about what Hubert Humphrey had gotten in '68, so we didn't
                    think that was too bad considering how McGovern did everywhere else.</p>
                <p>I had become a political hack. I worked political campaigns for the next few
                    yeara governor's race, a congressional.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you make money?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you survive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had saved a lot of money from the Foreign Service. I wasn't married,
                    didn't have any children, didn't have any expenses, and I lived largely at home
                    getting my food and laundry and rent, so I didn't need much. You get expenses
                    and put up. I did some freelancing for Virginia weekly newspapers. This lasted
                    for 2 or 3 years. Then in 1975 I finally got a real paying job as a
                    congressional aide to Robert Duncan of Oregon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: His son and campaign manager was one of my Vietnam friends and
                    recommended me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Robert Duncan come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: He was a Democrat, very much a blue collar, labor union, snuff
                    chewing, spitting in a paper cup, lumberjack boots Democrat. He had run twice
                    against Wayne Morris. These were the great symbolic hawk versus dove race of the
                    1960s. Duncan was the hawk on Vietnam and Morris was the dove. Morris beat him
                    each time by a narrow margin. So Duncan stopped running for Senate. Then when
                    Edith Green retired in the Portland suburbs he ran for that very democratic
                    seat, won the primary, and was a shoe-in for the general election, and was
                    looking for a staff, I worked for him even though he had been a hawk on Vietnam.
                    We squabbled and argued over foreign policy. He didn't generally accept my views
                    and I didn't generally accept his.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time Vietnam was no longer an issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It wasn't a burning issue on the Hill. The Senate was still engaged,
                    but the House really wasn't. Duncan was on appropriations. I learned about the
                    real world of concrete and pork and that was fascinating, dealing with Interior
                    and Transportation appropriations, highways and roads and subways and national
                    parks and Indian tribes and Bureau of Land Management and all sorts of things
                    that I knew nothing about. The wheeling dealing, trading, and this is real money
                    and important to these guys.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you wheel and deal or were you sort of a mechanic
                        dealing with the problems afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I didn't do the wheeling and dealing. Duncan did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He enjoyed it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: He loved it. He was pretty good at it. Then I left and went to the
                    Department of Transportation for 3 years and did congressional relations there
                    after Jimmy Carter was elected. I worked the Carter campaign and supported
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Department of
                        Transportation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Congressional relations. Political appointee. Then in 1981, I was
                    fired when Reagan was elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Department of Transportation? What
                        sort of a player was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was the next step in this world of moving from the abstract
                    foreign policy to the concrete, roads, subways, airports. So, it was fun
                    learning about something that was quite different from what I had done all my
                    life. There was nothing abstract about it. We had great fights over airline
                    deregulation, waterway deregulation, safety issues, and always squabbles over
                    how much money to put into highways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any problems with the Carter administration's
                        relations with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. We worked pretty well with Congress. The group I worked with were
                    all Hill veterans. My boss was an ex-Udall staffer. We all knew how the Hill
                    worked and worked well with it, whereas the WH was Ham Jordon, Jody Powell, the
                    Georgians, and they came up with a certain contempt for Congress and it showed.
                    They had a very bad time. So, our transportation stuff worked pretty well. We
                    were able to get what we needed to get, but the administration in general had a
                    lot of trouble. It was just how you deal with those guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '81, you're out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Now I've been out of the Foreign Service for 10 years. I'm unemployed.
                    I look into getting back into the Foreign Service, see if I can go back and not
                    be a junior officer. I looked and looked and lo and behold there was a way to do
                    it. I applied. I didn't have to take the written exam, but I did have to take
                    the oral exam again, so I did that and passed. I did probably a lot better than
                    I did the first time around.</p>
                <p>I waited for somebody to say, “But wait a minute, this guy was a democratic
                    political hack.” Nobody ever did. I was let back in. What I didn't know, and
                    only later learned slowly, was that coming back in, I came back in as a Foreign
                    Service-02 with absolutely no record, no file and no network and that that was a
                    huge disadvantage. I didn't know how to get jobs. I didn't know the system. I
                    didn't know the games. I didn't know the politics of it. It took me years to
                    catch up. That was the negative of it. There were absolutely no jobs. The first
                    job I got was a non-Foreign Service job, the Multinational Force and Observers
                    in the Sinai. That was lots of fun because it was the first group right after
                    the Camp David Accords. We were the first group to go in as part of the peace
                    process when Israel tore town the settlements in Sinai and pulled out and turned
                    it over to Egypt. It was great fun, but it wasn't Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when? Tell me about how
                        you set this up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: For one year, April '82 to roughly April '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was one of the 10 or 11 observers. Part of the Camp David Accord was
                    that Israel would give the Sinai back to Egypt only if there was some sort of
                    US-heavy international force in between that was not controlled by the UN. No
                    Soviet veto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the UN had pulled the UN observers out in '67,
                        which allowed the Israelis to really mop up the Arabs. It left a bitter
                        pill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They viewed the UN as hostile and as a creature then with the Soviet
                    veto and very much a creature of the Arabs. So, this was going to be a non-UN
                    peacekeeping effort with 10 or so U.S. government observers who would be running
                    around making sure that everybody was playing by the rules. There were 3 zones
                    set u2 Egyptian, one Israeland each zone differed on what sort of military
                    equipment you were allowed to have. So we were the police of the accord. It was
                    a fascinating job. It was really fun because we had huge Chevy Blazers with
                    great V8 engines. We had our own little helicopter air force to run all over the
                    Sinai, this magnificent landscape. I had never seen anything like it before. It
                    was full of wrecked tanks and relics of 4 wars. It was our job to run all over
                    it and make sure everybody was playing by the rules.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk first on the Egyptian side, your observations
                        of how they were working, and then on the Israeli side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The Egyptian soldiers that we dealt with extensively going around to
                    all these Egyptian outposts were always charming, welcoming, just as nice as
                    they could be in an army that clearly was challenged on some of the efficiency
                    and equipment fronts. It was, if not exactly Third World, it certainly wasn't
                    First World. During Ramadan, we'd land in a little outpost of a couple of
                    Egyptian soldiers and come up to chat and they would insist on offering us a tea
                    when it was 100 degrees in the desert. They couldn't drink because it was
                    Ramadan, but they would insist on us drinking because that was hospitality and
                    it was right.</p>
                <p>The Israelis, on the other hand, had a high tech, First World, very good army,
                    and were just as obnoxious as they could possibly be about every bit of it. They
                    didn't want us around. They didn't like this. Most of the Israeli soldiers were
                    reservists doing their stints. It was really remarkable. The democracy in the
                    Israeli army was spectacular. A private would tell off a colonel at the drop of
                    a hat because maybe that private was probably the museum director and the
                    colonel was just a baker. But it was real democracy within the army. For someone
                    who had never dealt with the Mideast, it was a very interesting insight into
                    that world and that conflict. Of course, the real news at that time was not the
                    Sinai. It was Lebanon and the invasion of Lebanon and then later Ariel Sharon
                    and the camps, Shatila and Sabra, when he endorsed and allowed the massacres in
                    those 2 camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to the Sinai. I've talked to people who have
                        served there who say that one of the problems was, the Israelis kept trying
                        to push the boundaries all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They were always pressing the rules. The only real serious violation I
                    caught was an Israeli self-propelled 155 millimeter Howitzer in their border
                    zone where they weren't supposed to have any artillery. It was fun to nail them
                    because they were so busy constantly pressing us to nail the Egyptians for all
                    sorts of petty Egyptian violations that weren't very serious. This guy had gone
                    and done some target practice and been a little sloppy about where the border
                    was. He was quite surprised when this orange helicopter landed beside him and I
                    got out in my funny orange jumpsuithat's so everybody would see us and not shoot
                    at uand said, “You know, you're in the wrong place.” That was fun. They were
                    constantly pressing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this have any effect on the observers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It meant you had to be careful. You had to make sure you were right.
                    you couldn't be sloppy or the Israelis would be calling you on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any pressure reflecting the political process
                        back in the US, where Israeli influence is profound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not at that? This was not politically charged. The only political
                    question was, would this hold? Would the Israelis really withdraw? Would the
                    Egyptians take it over and behave? Both were answered, yes. The Israelis really
                    did withdraw. The Egyptians really did behave. To this day, 20 years later, the
                    Sinai is-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were first there, did you have the feeling that
                        the 2 armies were on hair trigger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was fascinating. We got there a month before the accord was to go
                    into effect. We started out at this camp that was right next to one of the
                    passes, that had been a battleground. There had been an observer camp there as
                    part of an earlier agreement and that was where we started and then we were
                    moving with the agreement to the permanent camp, an Israeli air base near the
                    Gaza Strip in the northeast corner of the Sinai. So, we were at that camp when
                    they had the ceremony there at the camp for the accord in April 1982 with
                    Egyptian army officers and Israeli army officers meeting for the first time. It
                    was a revelation that the army officers understood each other and wanted peace.
                    They were the peaceable ones. Later you see this in Israeli politics, the
                    obvious exception being Sharon, but the peacemakers in Israeli politics usually
                    were former generals. They had been there. They had seen their friends die. They
                    had been through it 4 times on this front and they didn't want to do it again,
                    either side. That was really clear. They understood each other. There was a
                    kinship there that certainly wasn't there with the politicians. Obviously, Begin
                    and Sadat had no kinship whatsoever and nothing in common. Jimmy Carter just
                    sort of wrestled them together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? You were there around the Israeli army?
                        It's still astounding that you have the prime minister of Israel being Ariel
                        Sharon when he conducted essentially? He took the Israeli army and moved it
                        up to Beirut without authorization without hindrance from his political
                        leaders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Certainly without hindrance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Israeli officer corps when
                        they watched this go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I remember hearing a lot of dismay within the Israeli body politic,
                    the Jerusalem Post and other newspapers. But the army that we dealt with wasn't
                    like our army. These were not career army folks. Particularly on our side then,
                    we had the reservists because the shock troops were on the other side. And there
                    was much complaining about it. Israel certainly has its faults, but it does have
                    a vigorous debate amongst Israelis, amongst Jews. The Arab population of Israel
                    doesn't seem to be able to get into that debate much or be accepted into that
                    debate much. But in the Jewish community, they debate everything vigorously.</p>
                <p>Q: You left there in '83. I take it you really weren't plugged into any jobs.</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, nothing. I started to go through the assignment process for the
                    first time. I'd come in out of cycle. I was interested in Africa and the only
                    thing out there was right back to where I'd been: Kinshasa, which was
                    Leopoldville under a new name. I was assigned as number 2 in the political
                    section in Kinshasa, Zaire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from '83 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Zaire and Kinshasa like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Again, I enjoyed it. It was the court of King Mobutu and political
                    reporting was something I enjoyed very much. It was great fun to try and figure
                    out what was going on and who was doing what to whom. There were no facts or
                    hard evidence. It was all rumor and who would tell you what and sources and all
                    the rest of it. I remember reading at the same time a biography of Mary Queen of
                    Scots when she was in Scotland. It was the same thing. The court of Mary in the
                    1500s was very like the court of Mobutu in 1983. I did a report once on his
                    family. This is hard to imagine with a head of state, but there was no consensus
                    on how many children he had, who were children, who were full children, who were
                    half, who were recognized, who were not, and who he had actually married. There
                    were various anointed wives. There had been 2 anointed wives. But there were
                    clearly others. A hard fact was impossible to find. To a true political
                    reporter, what could be more fun?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How open did you find the society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The society was in theory very closed. It was very much a one man
                    show. Everything was decided by Mobutu. In practice, Zairians loved to talk and
                    everybody would talk. You had to figure out what to make of all the talk you
                    heard, what was likely and what was not, which was what's fun about being a
                    political reporter. That's the analysis of it. In terms of political reporting,
                    it was great fun and really a challenge. In terms of working and the US
                    relationship, it was very difficult. The station was huge. This was the time
                    when we were doing a lot of stuff in Angola and doing it out of Zaire. We were
                    endlessly confused with the station and frequently I would get in the way of the
                    station and that would not sit well with the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The first one was Peter Constable. The second one was Brandon Grove. I
                    had more troubles with Peter Constable, not his fault, but his mission was
                    basically to support the station and I was causing trouble. I didn't realize it,
                    but I was doing what I thought I was supposed to do as a political officer:
                    contacting dissidents and getting to know them. I knew all the so-called “bad
                    guys.”</p>
                <p>Q: Was the problem that you were contacting the dissidents and reporting on it or
                    was the problem that you were contacting the people who the station was playing
                    with?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was contacting the dissidents and Mobutu was complaining directly to
                    the ambassador and the station, “Get this guy to stop talking to those people.”
                    The inclination of the embassy was, the relationship with Mobutu was so
                    important that they didn't want it messed up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it so important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was never fully explained to me but I assumed it was because of
                    all the work through Zaire on Angola and maybe other things in support of
                    Savimbi and UNITA. This was early Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the embassy, was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The same arguments went round and round over the Congo for 30 years.
                    Mobutu could hold it together; nobody else can. He's our ticket. We've got to
                    stay with him. And a counter-argument saying, “Mobutu is the reason why it's a
                    mess.” Both arguments were true and are still true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It's a mess and it's a mess in part because of Mobutu. But he did help
                    hold it together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the embassy officer corps, was there concern about
                        Mobutu and our ties to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not much that I detected. I was pretty much the only one that was
                    following that line. I was certainly the only one talking to what was called the
                    “13,” the dissidents like Tschisked, who was thrown in jail, and Makanda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they just being dissidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, they were providing something resembling an alternative. It was
                    flawed, too, but they were trying to put together an alternative and getting a
                    lot of attention because Mobutu kept throwing them in jail, having them beat up
                    and stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the political life concentrated in Leopoldville? It's
                        a huge country. What was happening elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That's always a problem with that huge country, that there is Kinshasa
                    and then there's what is going on in the rest of the country, and usually nobody
                    knows. Mobutu in many ways wanted it that way. Many analysts assumed that he
                    neglected the infrastructure in part because he didn't want you to be able to
                    get quickly from Katanga to Kinshasa because then you could cause trouble. In
                    fact, what had been a fairly good infrastructure brought by the Belgians was
                    reduced to? Zaire was the size of the United States east of the Mississippi. By
                    the time I was there, it had the infrastructure of the United States east of the
                    Mississippi in about 1820: dirt roads, not much else. My wife found this Spanish
                    TV crew that was doing a TV show going across Zaire with this fancy truck. They
                    had a driver and the driver didn't speak French, so they needed an interpreter,
                    so she went with them and actually drove across Zaire, which nobody did. It took
                    10 days and a number of washed out bridges and things like that. But it was 10
                    days to drive 1,000 miles.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you acquire a wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I acquired a wife before I came back into the Foreign Service in the
                    late '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Her father and my father met in 1935 when they both took and both
                    failed the Foreign Service exam. My father heard her father being called out,
                    William Breese. He said, “Breese? That's my mother's maiden name.” So he
                    accosted him and asked who he was. It turned out his Breeses were from New York.
                    So he went home that weekend and asked his mother, “There are Breeses from New
                    York. Are we related somehow?” She said, “Oh, those Breeses. Yes. They're in
                    trade.” Our Breeses were all naval officers. They had actually made money,
                    whereas ours didn't.</p>
                <p>So, our parents met there. They kept in touch. Many years later, my father
                    retired from the Foreign Service, came back to Washington and met t Breeses
                    again somewhere on the Washington circuit and invited them and their daughter
                    over for dinner. I was invited and I thought the daughter was terrific. She
                    thought I was kind of a bore, but I pursued and persisted. Two years later, we
                    got married.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the diplomatic social life in

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: With Zairians, it was either these over the top, too much money spent,
                    too fancy villas, too fancy receptions for government elite figures, or it was
                    the struggling middle class. They were lucky if they had a cement floor and if
                    they had running water. Anyhow, it was manioc pounded into a concrete-like
                    paste. Then you put some sauce or chicken on it. So, it was too much money on
                    one side and too little money on the other side. The huge gap was really
                    visible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: A little. I spent some time in my old Katanga, where I spent 6 months
                    as a kid, but that was in Lubumbashi where we had a consulate. And I got up to
                    Stanleyville/Kisangani. I got up to Bukavu, one of those beautiful places.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. That zone from Bujumbura, from the head of Lake Tanganyika up to
                    the Sudan border of the volcanic mountains across the spine of Africa, it's
                    Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Zaire or Congo on the west side. It's just the most
                    magnificent country. There are live volcanoes. Gorillas. Forests. Lakes.
                    Stunningly beautiful.</p>
                <p>The last 10 years have been very hard on that country. Millions of refugees. It's
                    been deforested. Lava flows. Civil war. It's had no end to trouble. I don't know
                    if it's still beautiful, but it certainly was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There weren't so much at the post because it was so politically
                    charged at that point. It wasn't so much the traditional Africa hands.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: None of the guys I worked with? I don't think any of them did other
                    Africa tours. Peter Constable wasn't a true Africa hand. Brandon Grove wasn't an
                    Africa hand. The political counselor, who I worked for, was an alcoholic and
                    later died just a couple years later. The inside the embassy part of it was not
                    good. I was out of step and it wasn't a step I particularly was looking to be
                    in.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: No formal hold. There was no vetoing of reporting. I did have a free
                    hand on reporting. The assumption was, that's okay, nobody's reading it anyhow.
                    But what I did run into friction on regularly from the station, and that got to
                    the ambassador, was that I shouldn't be talking to the people I was talking to.
                    I was also talking to some of the Mobutu folks, too, because it was important to
                    have those contacts.</p>

                        really been talking to the others. I would have thought that there would
                        have been a certain tenderness on this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I think it's a chronic problem with embassies. Every ambassador wants
                    to have good relations with the president or the head of state, particularly in
                    countries where it is a one man show, because that's his or her meal ticket.
                    He's got to be able to get the president on short notice to meet a senator or
                    tell him what the government's going to do on X. He's got to be able to get to
                    him. If you're too mean to him, the president wont let you anywhere as near.
                    Ambassadors learn the hard way. If access is cut off, they're ineffective. When
                    it's a dictatorship, access means you've got to be careful how you criticize and
                    when. Plus, there's just a whiff of Homerism: “This is my country for 3 years
                    and we're going to get it right. We're going to need all the help we can get. I
                    don't want anybody rocking that particular boat.” Every embassy is prone to it.
                    Some manage to avoid it. Some have situations where it's easy to avoid because
                    you just don't get along with the government anyhow. But most have big problems
                    with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '85. whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Somebody had sent around a thing saying they were looking for
                    temporary charg�s in Guinea Bissau and I raised my hand, so I got what turned
                    out to be 5 months of running a little embassy in a country so obscure that even
                    Graham Greene never got there. Bissau was really? There is the end of the line
                    and then there's 2 steps further. That's Bissau. There was one restaurant in
                    town, but you had to bring the food. They'd cook it if you brought it. But
                    nobody had any food. I remember going to the market for the first time and these
                    women with 3 tiny tomatoes waiting for somebody to buy those 3 tiny tomatoes. It
                    was pathetic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at this. Why did we have relations with the
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was where the revolution against Portuguese colonial power
                    peaked. Amakar Cabral was a Bissauan, a leading figure, and he led a revolution
                    of all these African intellectuals at the University of Lisbon against
                    Portuguese rule that spread to Mozambique and Angola and much more important
                    places than Bissau. Cabral was the original intellectual underpinning of that.
                    In Bissau, the guerrillas actually defeated the Portuguese army, unlike
                    Mozambique and Angola, where eventually the Portuguese just withdrew after their
                    revolution in 1975. In Bissau, they were defeated. So, it was an interesting
                    little country from that perspective. We had no particular interest there, but a
                    new government, the revolutionary government, was strongly Marxist- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Who were largely from Cape Verde. There was a joint thing, one party for Cape
                    Verde and Bissau. Then Ojo�o Viera, who was one of the guerrilla commanders and
                    was definitely a bush Bissaun and a fighter, not a Marxist from the University
                    of Lisbon. He led a coup 5 years after independence in 1980 and took over the
                    government and threw the Cape Verdean mulattos out. When I get there in '85,
                    Marxism, as it did practically everywhere else, had totally destroyed what
                    little economy there was. There was no economy at all. Viera and the country
                    were beginning to look around for ways out of this. There was a French embassy,
                    a Portuguese embassy, the Scandinavians (who always loved African socialists),
                    and that was it. And the UN, UN agencies. It was pretty hard to argue that we
                    really needed to have an embassy there. You could only argue on the basis of
                    universalism, that it's a good idea because we are a preeminent superpower to
                    have an embassy in every country because they all have votes at the UN. You can
                    argue that case, but that was about it. If Bissau fell apart, it wouldn't make
                    much difference. Bissau indeed later did fall apart and it didn't make much
                    difference. The embassy was evacuated and closed and there has been no push to
                    re-open it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, it was great fun. The people were very nice and friendly. The
                    Portuguese had paid so little attention to it that after 400 years of Portuguese
                    rule, only 5% of the population was Catholic. That was just a few people in the
                    city and that was it. They hadn't bothered with any missionary thing or anything
                    else. We built a little compound outside of town and I would go walking through
                    the cashew groves that went for miles and miles beyond my house between me and
                    the airport. It was traditional, pre-European, Africa with fetishes, drums in
                    the night, villages, ladies didn't wear tops. This was before the Christians and
                    missionaries and the bureaucrats and everybody else from Europe got to Africa.
                    So that was kind of fun. Plus, they were, as so many Africans are, so welcoming.
                    Despite the fact that it was a Marxist country, everybody was perfectly nice to
                    me, the representative of a capitalist power.</p>
                <p>What did we do there? We presented all the usual demarches that embassies present
                    all over the world. Protect tropical mahogany, for example, to the poor
                    bewildered Bissauan foreign minister who was trying to figure out if there was
                    some way he could find the cash to keep his entire embassy in New York for
                    another day in order to vote on some of these things. We had a little AID
                    mission. We worried about trying to get them going on a path towards some sort
                    of economic stability and economic reform, which they were eager to try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes, several times. He was quite accessible. I met him several times.
                    In fact, one of the rituals I remember vividly is, they were doing, as so many
                    African countries do, whenever the president leaves or arrives, the entire
                    diplomatic corps was convoked to the airport to greet him or to send him off. It
                    was a great ritual there. We would all get to bitch and whine as we stood out in
                    the sun on the tarmac waiting to wave as the plane went by. Then the moment the
                    chief of protocol gave the signal, there was this great duel amongst the embassy
                    drivers as to who would get out first. My driver was the champion. It was touch
                    and go as to whether he could get out ahead of the Cuban or not. Of course, I
                    wasn't allowed to talk to the Cuban or even to acknowledge his existence, but
                    our drivers were in constant combat.</p>

                    The Palestinians. The only place you could get avocados was from the PLO-run
                    farm. I wasn't allowed to talk to them either. This was shortly after Andy Young
                    had been fired for talking to the PLO. I wasn't allowed to talk to the PLO. I
                    had to go to the Egyptian ambassador and ask if he could smuggle me a few
                    Palestinian avocados.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: The same thing. All sorts of noble causes, good things, that probably
                    never amounted to anything. It's been written about a number of times. I don't
                    know anybody that's ever managed to get the whole story of 30-40 years of
                    European aid in Africa and what it has accomplished. It's a hard one. All for
                    the best of reasons? Well, not all of it. There were a few exceptions. Some of
                    it was self-interest. But a lot of it, particularly the Scandinavians, was
                    reasonably altruistic and accomplished so little. You could really see that in
                    Tanzania, which had been one of the major recipients for many years and had so
                    little to show for it.</p>

                    spend much money on Bissau. So, the government was turning away from the
                    Russians and looking to particularly the World Bank, us and the French. The

                    that I'm sure nobody ever noticed. But as a charg� and a political officer,
                    you're doing your job. Locked the embassy down, made sure everybody was at home
                    and in the right place and safe. I predicted that it would fail. Indeed it
                    happened that night and it did fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, it was some of the army officers going after Viera. Later, long
                    after I left, they did it and they had a nice little civil war and they
                    overthrew him. It was tribally based.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was really all most people had to rely on. The modern or developed
                    world's presence was so light in Bissau. Because all the government figures had
                    been in Guinea when they were fighting the war, Sekou Toure gave them a base,
                    and most of them had learned French, so I was able to operate in French. My
                    Portuguese was very limited. It was a charming little country that I suppose
                    couldn't even feed itself unlike some other African basket cases, once it got
                    rid of the Marxist trappings. I was in this huge cashew grove. Cashew is a very
                    high value crop, but they weren't making a cent off it because it had all been
                    nationalized and run into the ground. So, the local folks were just making
                    cashew wine and having parties. There would be these big wooden troughs where
                    they'd pound the cashew into juices of some sort and make wine out of it,
                    ferment it, and have a good party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I got a job as political officer in Tanzania that wouldn't start until
                    the following summer. Of course, I hadn't had my wife with me in Bissau. I came
                    back in November and had 6 months of family life here in Washington. Now we had
                    a baby, a son. Then we packed out and went to Tanzania in June. I spent 3 months
                    learning Swahili.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: When I arrived, he was a USIA officer, Jock Shirley, who had been the
                    candidate to take over USIA and then been not picked by Mr. Wick, so he was
                    somewhat disgruntled and he got to Tanzania as a booby prize in the lottery. But
                    he was a nice guy. He was there just briefly for a month or so when I arrived.
                    The main reason I mention this is because his wife was also Foreign Service. She
                    was going as consul general in Sicily and he was learning to sail so that he
                    could go sailing in Sicily. So, he invited me on a boat he chartered and we
                    sailed over to Zanzibar within a week of my arrival. That was great fun. Then he
                    was succeeded by Don Petterson, who I still see occasionally, a veteran Foreign
                    Service Africa hand. His first or second Foreign Service assignment as a junior
                    officer was as the junior officer at Consulate Zanzibar working for Frank
                    Carlucci, whom I had known in Leopoldville when I was 18 years old and he was
                    the young junior officer hero.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Julius Nyerere, God bless his honesty, had finally recognized that
                    what he was doing wasn't working and had stepped down. This is almost unheard of
                    in political figures in Africa or in the West. His anointed successor was Ali
                    Hassan Mwinyi, a Zanzibari Muslim, Tanzania's first Muslim president. Nyerere
                    was a patent leather pump. He was flashy, demonstrative, and he pinched probably
                    a little bit to the Tanzanian foot. He was much too flashy and he loved an
                    argument and he strode the world stage as a major figure. Everybody had heard of
                    him. Mwinyi was the tattered old slippers chewed by the dog, very comfortable
                    and virtually invisible. You would find out weeks later, you'd see something had
                    happened and trace it bacmaybe Mwinyi actually did something to make that
                    happen. But he wouldn't announce it. He'd take no credit for it. He was just
                    invisible. He was the true Tanzanian. He fit the Tanzanian personality. Nyerere
                    did not. Nyerere was much more the West African stylin your face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Nyerere a presence all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes, very much so. He lived just down the beach from me. I lived away
                    from most of the other embassy people on the bay outside of town. Nyerere had
                    his house and Jane Goodall had her house next door. A few doors down was me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was again how can we do this differently? The socialist model had
                    come unglued. The answer after my 3 years there was, it was so ingrained they
                    didn't know how to do it any other way. Maybe by today, major changes have
                    occurred 10-15 years later. But during my time, the first 3 years after Nyerere,
                    they still had all the Scandinavian donors pushing the same approach. Their
                    mindset was so government dominated and government must do it and the elite must
                    do it and we're the elite that even though they gave lip service to trying new
                    approaches, it was pretty much the same. The economy continued to stagger along.
                    This was a country with a large land area, relatively light population, plenty
                    of fertile soil, not much in terms of real resources but it ought to be able to
                    feed itself easily. If Kenya with only 10-12% arable land could feed itself and
                    export, have booming agricultural exports, there was no excuse for Tanzania
                    failing, yet it failed year after year. It couldn't feed itself. It couldn't
                    come up with any exports. The failure has to be laid at government's door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this acknowledged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes, not in the terms I just put it in, but Tanzanians, there was this
                    endless argument with Kenya over the approach, Kenya being at least
                    semi-capitalist and Tanzania being avowedly socialist? Tanzanians were very
                    aware of it and very self-conscious of it and frustrated that they couldn't seem
                    to get it right. They knew they should be able to get it right.</p>

                <p>In terms of people, it was a great country to explore. Of course, it had game
                    parks and Kilimanjaro and the beach and Zanzibar. I spent a lot of time in
                    Zanzibar. It was my job to report on Zanzibar and that was great fun and also
                    very different than the mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had gone through quite a difficult time between the
                        Arabs and the Africans. How had things settled down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was 15 years after overthrow of the government. The Omani sheikh
                    had fled to Muscat. The Chinese and the Russians moved in. They were still all
                    there. There was a big Chinese embassy and a big Russian embassy or consulate.
                    And the Omani sheikdom still had an embassy there. But it had become during my
                    time a much gentler place. Everybody realized they had overdone it. There had
                    been substantial bloodshed in '64/'65. I think they were a bit embarrassed over
                    that. In my time, again like the mainland, they were looking cautiously around
                    for ways out of the socialist mess they had put themselves in without abandoning
                    the principles of it. How can we make a little money without giving up our ideas
                    of what is equality and Third World solidarity and all the rest of it? There was
                    some talk, most of which has now years later come true, Zanzibar now has a
                    tourist industry, but when I was there, the only hotel was the government run
                    Bwani and it was pretty awful. There had been a flood that had soaked all the
                    industrial carpeting and it just stank. Plus, Zanzibaris have a tendency to
                    bring in doriani, a spiky tropical fruit that has the most obnoxious smell.
                    Zanzibaris like this. I never could stomach the stuff myself. But they liked it
                    and so they would bring it into the lobby and the place would stink. The tourism
                    industry was struggling when I was there. Since, I gather it's done a lot
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a party system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Very much so. The CCM, the Chama Cha Mapenduzi, the party of the
                    revolution, ran everything. The next 10 years after I left, there were attempts
                    to reform, modernize, and upgrade the CCM into something mildly democratic
                    instead of an old Marxist style party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not then, but one of the guys I dealt with a lot, Sharif Hamad, is
                    still a major opposition leader. He was the young rising star in the CCM. I
                    guess he didn't rise fast enough for his satisfaction and broke ranks. Since
                    then, he has been the leading dissident for the 10 or so years, leading the
                    opposition and probably winning the election before last in Zanzibar and then
                    having it stolen from him by the CCM and with international fussing.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the government at that time?
                        Was it corrupt? Was it responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was modestly corrupt compared to Zaire. Corruption didn't drive
                    everything the way it did in Zaire. But there was corruption. It was basically
                    just? There were a lot of bright, able, struggling government employees that I
                    dealt with and a lot of Tanzanians gave up the fight and went off to the
                    international bureaucracthe World Bank, the IMF, the UN, and whatevebecause they
                    just couldn't handle the frustration of a government that didn't work very well.
                    What I remember more vividly was the business side of it. We were trying to help
                    Tanzania privatize and allow a little private enterprise because we thought that
                    was important to their economic health. I particularly remember one American
                    funded safari company coming in that was a professional company that was set up
                    in Tanzania. They ran into the bank of Africa: the insider of the elite with
                    excellent connections, a “businessman” who uses his political connections to
                    grab the business, sees something that's a viable business out there that's
                    brought in by outside money, and uses his political power to block it unless
                    they pay him or turn it over to him. It was one of those things that was so
                    insidious. Of course, once that happens and one business has it, the word gets
                    out and American businesses don't come because they're not going to put up with
                    that. The answer is, “We'll drop that country from the list.” Does the
                    government realize that? Yes, probably intellectually. But does that mean they
                    stop it or deal with it? No.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you ever get any talks with any of your Swedish colleagues there about how
                    things were going? Had the bloom gone off the Scandinavian rose by this
                    time?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Sure. I saw a lot of them. Tanzania was littered with
                    Scandinavian-financed projects. Mbaya by itself was a little town on the Zambian
                    border in the west. There was the pottery plant, the toy plant, slaughterhouse,
                    some other things that had all been funded by Scandinavian aid programs. They
                    were all things that were needed that were good ideas. But nobody had figured
                    out how to actually implement them so that they endured. They set up the usual
                    government parastatal to run them which immediately ran them into the ground,
                    either looted the premises or out of greed or incompetence destroyed the
                    business, so there they sat. There were all these buildings scattered around
                    Mbaya that were once great projects that were needed and could have done good
                    under some other scheme.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We still have lots of very handsome dinner plates from this one project that we
                    got to know? There was a German couple. It was Swedish financed but the Swedes
                    didn't have any potters, so they hired a German couple to be their potters, sent
                    them to Mbaya with all the equipment and all the money they needed for this
                    great new, high powered electric kiln. There was only one problem. There was no
                    money to pay the electric bill, so the parastatal electric company cut off the
                    electricity, made the whole place useless. So this German potter is up there
                    every night hot-wiring the electricity so they can steal electricity and run the
                    kilns at night and make their pottery. He showed initiative and entrepreneurial
                    skill. They made lots of great pottery which we bought and a few other
                    westerners in Dar es Salaam bought. Then I'm sure it went bankrupt with all
                    these beautiful kilns hardly used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had put quite a bit of money into projects there, too,
                        hadn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We did. Ours were more traditional agriculture. The big one that
                    everybody always reminded us of was the Tanzam railway, which we took one look
                    at when Nyerere first proposed it in the '60s and said, “No, this can't be
                    built. It's too expensive.” So, the Chinese said, “Yes, that can be done.” They
                    built it. Now, by the time I got there, the Chinese engines wouldn't pull the
                    hills, so AID was working a deal to get some American locomotives that would
                    pull it. But it was still there and it was still always pointed out to any
                    American as “This is the railroad you said couldn't be built.” We did some
                    agricultural stuff. We had an AID mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to all these resettled villagers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was a classic case of what I'm talking about. This was Nyerere's
                    great socialist dream that he would pull together villagers into villages that
                    would have all the infrastructurthe school, the clinic, the well, everything
                    elsand because they were concentrated, it would be economically feasible to put
                    the school, the clinic, and the well there. So they would have government
                    services. Then they would farm prosperously. Well, the villagers hated it
                    because they wanted to be where the fields were. Villagers all over don't like
                    being moved. So, all over the country, you would go through these Ujamaa
                    villages that hardly anybody lived in anymore and have the ruins of a school,
                    the clinic, and the well because, like the poverty project, it was a good idea
                    in theory, but the practicality of it was going against instincts and there was
                    no mechanism to make sure that the school was staffed and maintained, that the

                    reform itself and become a functioning democracy. It at least tried more than I
                    expected it to under a guy I worked with who was then the foreign minister and
                    is now the president. But there is no indication that Tanzania is ready to join

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I came back to Washington to be a desk officer, the Zambia-Malawi desk
                    officer, in Southern African Affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Also, I came back in part also because my mother was sick and

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zambia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Zambia at that time, President Kaunda was being challenged, the
                    founding father. Unlike Nyerere, he was not willing to admit that socialism had
                    failed and that he had failed and instead was maintaining everything was fine.
                    That was being challenged by a unique alliance that was really promisinlabor
                    unions led by Fred Chiluba. The lawyers were fed up with corrupt judges and a
                    failed legal system. Businessmen were tired of this half-assed socialism. And
                    just good government people who were tired of bad government. There was a
                    wonderful coalition, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, the MMD. They ended
                    up with Chiluba as their candidate and Chiluba won. That happened after I left
                    the desk. Pretty quickly he began getting rid of these guys, the reformers, so
                    he could run things almost the way Kaunda had. Since then he has now been beaten
                    in an election and indicted by his successor for corruption. That's another
                    country, even more so than Tanzania, with plenty of arable land, low population,
                    no major tribal fights or bitterness to deal with, resources, that can't get it
                    together. The only excuse is bad government for Zambia not succeeding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Malawi?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Malawi differed. It was tiny, overpopulated, no resources, and one of
                    those countries that, like Switzerland, exist only if they find some extraneous
                    way to be of service to the rest of the world. Ruled for 30 years by the old
                    Scottish headmaster, Hastings Banda, and the place was like an old fashioned
                    puritanical boarding school. Hastings Banda was a stern, fire breathing
                    Presbyterian who happened to be African. Everybody, no matter how threadbare,
                    wore their jacket and tie and white shirt. The flowerbeds on the roadside were
                    neatly trimmed and the roads were always perfectly maintained. There weren't
                    very many of them. Everybody was precise and orderly and neat and tidy and
                    nobody spoke out of turn or they got their knuckles rapped or worse. I spent
                    those 2 years as desk officer. The Zambia part that was fun was the development
                    of the MMD and the challenge to Kaunda, the real democratic challenge, genuine
                    grassroots democracy emerging in Africa, in Zambia. On the Malawi side, nobody
                    knew when it was going to end, but I was busy protecting a couple of dissidents
                    from Banda's wrath. I spent a lot of time on that and got some nice “thank yous”
                    from the one family. Aleke Banda had been Hastings Banda's finance minister and
                    then had gone and disagreed and made his disagreements public. President Banda
                    went after him and he fled into exile for a while. Then he had the courage to go
                    back and was promptly thrown in jail. The question was keeping enough pressure
                    on the regime so that they didn't kill him. Another was a labor union guy that I
                    also had to keep pressure on the regime to make sure they didn't kill him.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, demarches and you make it very clear that the US embassy is
                    watching and paying attention. That makes it a little less easy to have this guy
                    just disappear, which is what had been happening in Malawi. If they really
                    wanted to disappear him, they still will, but we tried to make clear there would
                    be a bit of a price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kaunda make a trip to the US while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No. Chiluba did. That was after I was desk officer. In Malawi, there
                    was a woman and there was a wonderful title for heI cant remember what it wawho
                    had been Hastings Banda's nurse and was his attendant, consort, whatever. She
                    came and she didn't fit any of the protocol formats. She wasn't his wife. She
                    wasn't the first lady. But she was essentially the first lady and a political
                    power of considerable force. We had to figure out how to deal with her. Joseph
                    Reed was the chief of protocol. I went to him and got him to put on the dog, all
                    the dog he could put on without violating any of the rules. He loved doing that.
                    A good chief of protocol has to love that stuff and he did. The visit was a
                    success. She wasn't called the “presidential companion” but it was something
                    like that, odd. “The official hostess?” But it was very important that she be
                    happy with the visit or we would hear about it from Hastings. When I went out
                    and visited Malawi and went with the ambassador on a call, one of the most
                    senior ministers was with him when we went in. We watched the ministers were
                    getting down on their knees and bowing to this little mahe was then in his
                    90before they left. We didn't get down on our knees. Fortunately, a few years
                    later, Banda did finally die. There was much thought that maybe he really was
                    immortal. Fortunately, that proved not to be the case. Malawi is struggling with
                    its version of democracy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the Africa Bureau?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I liked it. It was a camaraderie. This was when Hank Cohen was
                    Assistant Secretary and Jeff Davidow was the PDAS. Davidow was always funny and
                    always irreverent. He went on to be a real superstar. He was ambassador in
                    Zambia, so I worked with him, and then he came back to be PDAS. Then he went on
                    and was ambassador in Venezuela. Then he was ambassador in Mexico. Then he just
                    made career ambassador and I think he's now been pensioned off. But a great guy,
                    very funny. I was working in AF/S, which at that point had 60-70% of the
                    bureau's business with South Africa still not settled, we had just gotten
                    Namibia settled, and we were still wrestling with Angola. The whole time I was
                    there, we had this Angolan peace process that I would back up occasionally,
                    trying to get some kind of cease-fire going and some sort of agreement. This was
                    the first Bush administration. The Reagan liberation struggle had been given up
                    and they decided maybe it was time Savimbi just quit if we could find a graceful
                    way for him to do it.</p>

                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, when I was in Tanzania, one of the most difficult parts of my
                    job was defending constructive engagement. I was someone who didn't much believe
                    in it, but you're a Foreign Service officer; you have to say what your
                    government's policy is? I took to saying, “My government believes? My government
                    thinks? My government maintains that?,” not “I think? I maintain that?”</p>
                <p>One of the fun things about Dar es Salaam was dealing with the ANC and with the
                    PAC, the Pan African Congress, mostly with the PAC because this was their
                    headquarters. The ANC was based in Lusaka but they had a suboffice in Dar. That
                    was a lot of fun and insight into what was going on in South Africa, which was
                    something I didn't know much about and I had never been there. I went to a big
                    ANC blowouI forget what over? There was another one I went to in Arusha that was
                    the 25th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's conviction and jailing where I met
                    Thabo Mbeki. This one was in Dar. Chris Hani, the firebrand Marxist leader of
                    the ANC, was the speaker. In the course of the speech he blasted US policy. I
                    was the American embassy representative. “Is this where I get up and walk out?”
                    I wondered. Is this strong enough for me to walk out? what's the magic trigger?
                    I of course hadn't had any advice from the ambassador. Finally- (end of
                    tape)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying after a series of insulting statements,

                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I'm trying to decide as a U.S. diplomat how much is too much, where do
                    I draw the line, and where do I walk out? I finally decide he has gone too far
                    too much. Of course, I am in the middle of the row, in the big auditorium. I had
                    to clamber over several ambassadors and other diplomats to get to the aisle.
                    Very conspicuous, all by myself, walking up this empty aisle in the middle of
                    the speech. I leave and get back and write the cable. Of course, in the cable,
                    my mindset being “I've got to make sure this is justified,” and being totally
                    naive about the politics of Washington, I write the cable what he said and what
                    I put up with and then when I walked out. Back comes a bullet immediately after
                    the cable goes out saying, “Why didn't you walk out sooner?” Oh. I went back
                    shortly thereafter to the States and Chas Freeman, who was then one of the
                    DASes, called me in, or I asked to see him. I said, “What did I miss here?
                    Please explain the political background.” He said, “Oh, that's perfectly easy.
                    Read all the cables from Zambia.” I think it was Nick Platt who was the
                    ambassador there. Of course, he was dealing with the ANC every day. This was
                    still late Reagan administration and everything was being leaked to the Hill by
                    conservatives to the Jessie Helms crowd, which was keeping watch on those State
                    Department commies. So, what Nick Platt would do was list what the ANC said and
                    then he would add a this paragraph, “Of course, I told those sons of bitches
                    what a load of crap that was and I pounded the table,” or something like that.
                    Once he got that done, then he would do whatever reporting he had to do, what he
                    thought we could do, how we should respond. But he had to have that paragraph.
                    Freeman explained that that was essential because then if it was leaked, it
                    didn't make us sound like a bunch of Marxist lap dogs. We stood up for the U.S.
                    and we made it clear. Even if he didn't say it, he put it in there. In your
                    case, Hani said those these things and the immediate response was, “You should
                    have walked out after the first one.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was the bureau labor advisor. Most bureaus had one. At that point we
                    had still a small office or bureau for labor relations that dealt with the
                    annual ILO [International Labor Organization] meeting and relations with the
                    AFL-CIO. In fact they had been major players, the AFL-CIO had, in this brokerage
                    in the fall of the Communist Bloc and the Wall with Solidarity in Poland, which
                    the AFL-CIO strongly supported, and some of the other Eastern European labor
                    unions that became part of the liberation of Eastern Europe. Then later it was
                    just subsumed into DRL [Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor] and I'm not sure
                    what remains of all that today.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you doing?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I was doing Africa. I was in touch with that office. This was the time
                    when we were beginning to push hard on democracy in Africa and having the first
                    glimmerings - Zambia was one - of grassroots efforts to actually get rid of the
                    one party rule of the '60s, '70s, and '80s and move to multiparty democracy and
                    elections. Labor was a large part of that - often in a number of African
                    countries, the only organized political body outside the party or even inside
                    the party that wasn't completely owned by the party, so it was a potential power
                    base and that made it very interesting. Of course, particularly it was a major
                    player in South Africa. It was my job to keep in touch with all these people and
                    be aware of what they were doing and make sure our people knew what the labor
                    crowd was up to and make sure our word got to the labor crowd about coordination
                    with this nascent democracy movement that was beginning to pop up in Senegal, in
                    Zambia, in Kenya, in other parts, and particularly in South Africa.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: It was the strongest internal political organization, but the ANC only
                    saw it as a tripartite alliance. The ANC was mostly in exile at that point and
                    based in Zambia led by Tabo Mbeki with Nelson Mandela still in jail. The
                    Communist Party which was in South Africa and was considered a full ally of the
                    ANC led by Chris Hani, the guy I walked out on Dar es Salaam. Then the third and
                    maybe most powerful internal part of that tripartite alliance was the Cosatu,
                    the labor alliance in South Africa. That included some very powerful unions -
                    the Mine Workers that could and did occasionally shut down the whole
                    setup...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these all blacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: These were African and Indian. Some of the Cosatu leadership was
                    Asian, Indian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there white unions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There were, but they were non-players. Everything in South Africa was
                    divided on racial lines, so they were with the national party and not with the
                    liberation movement. I had no dealings... If there were white unions, I had no
                    dealings with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see the union movement being a positive force for
                        change or did we see it as being a force that might lead to racial
                        warfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We saw it as a force for change. We weren't sure whether it was
                    positive or not. It was. There was great nervousness on this side about the
                    alliance with the Communist Party. Most of these labor unions were certainly
                    Marxist trained and many of them were Marxist. But this was also the time when
                    that ideology was finally crashing in Europe and elsewhere and coming up
                    bankrupt. As in the ANC, many of whom had at least started out as Marxists,
                    there was a gradual wakening and moving away from a few remaining hardcore
                    Marxists who still are to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your office more or less taking orders from the
                        AFL-CIO? How was the relationship there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: While I was doing it, it was quite good because we were... This was
                    Bush I. There had been an alliance of convenience in international affairs based
                    for some years at this point with the support for Solidarity. The AFL-CIO's
                    history was building up as a strongly anti-communist labor movement opposing the
                    largely Marxist influence in American unions of the '30s. So, communism within
                    the union movement here had been a big issue 20-40 years earlier and largely
                    been resolved. These were the survivors of those wars. So there was a strong
                    anti-communist flavor to George Meanie's AFL-CIO. They thought what they were
                    doing with Solidarity in Poland was extremely important and their way of pushing
                    democratic unionism. The administration saw it as a great way to get out the
                    underpinnings of a communist state. So there was an alliance of convenience that
                    I just rode on the coattails of. We worked closely together. The AFL-CIO did
                    have labor advisors in a few countries in Africa that had a little money, some
                    through AID, and I worked with them. They had extensive contacts with the labor
                    movement in those countries, so that was the window into making an assessment of
                    what sort of players on the local political scene labor was in each country. In
                    a number of countries, they weren't much of a player, but in a few, they were
                    important. Labor was important, so it was good to keep an eye on those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find you were getting pretty good information from
                        our embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Not much. It wasn't something our embassies generally followed. Part
                    of what I did was to prod them. I did develop a cable newsletter that I would do
                    every month or 2 weeks of what was going on in labor mainly to get the embassies
                    aware that there was something going on here, this was part of the political
                    scene and was worth keeping an eye on and in some cases was actually an
                    important element of the political scene. It was more a sales job, me selling
                    them on it than them telling me about it. But in a few cases... Certainly in
                    South Africa the embassy recognized that Cosatu was a major player and the
                    Johannesburg consulate saw that as probably their major reporting job. They had
                    a full-time labor officer at the consulate who worked with Cosatu. They knew, we
                    all knew, that was probably the most important political force inside the
                    country against apartheid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the South African
                        government, at that time being a white government, dealt with the labor
                        movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They hated it and were afraid of it because they recognized it had
                    real economic power and it had demonstrated it in some tough strikes years
                    before. I think there was one mine workers strike while I was there, but it was
                    resolved pretty quickly because they had had their labor fights and the South
                    African powers that were had recognized that they had to deal with organized
                    labor, that organized labor was organized, did have the strength to shut them
                    down, could shut them down, and therefore it was important to make
                    accommodations. Many of the leaders in the anti-apartheid movement did come out
                    of Cosatu.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it was the most significant black organization
                        within the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Absolutely. In the country it was much more significant than the
                    parties, which were underground, oppressed, or were in jail and were mostly in
                    exile, including the Communist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Somalia. Give some background of how you
                        got into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I'm in the Regional Affairs Office. That's always the office the
                    Africa Bureau front offices uses for things that don't neatly fit into one of
                    the regions. The Africa Bureau is divided into 4 regional offices: South, East,
                    West, and Central, and an Economic Office and an Administrative Office and a
                    Regional Affairs Office. The Regional Affairs Office is for everything that
                    doesn't fit into one of the others. It does all the UN work, which is
                    continent-wide. It does the theme works like democracy, whatever the theme of
                    the moment is that we're pushing. And the staffers there are the pool that the
                    assistant secretary and the deputy assistant secretaries draw on when they need
                    to take something that isn't country specific or even region specific, like
                    democracy. And when it came to Somalia, there was no Somalia desk because there
                    was no government in Somalia. There had been no government for 2 years. Said
                    Barre had been thrown out, and a civil war followed between the factions that
                    threw him out. That civil war and a drought led to a massive famine in the Horn.
                    It was an early example of what became known as the “CNN syndrome” where a
                    humanitarian crisis is put on television so constantly that it builds up a
                    constituency for doing something about it. That constituency developed inside
                    the government as well as outside - the NGOs and political activists and others.
                    Assistant Secretary Cohen was definitely interested in seeing if there was some
                    way the U.S. government could usefully help solve this, particularly the famine.
                    So we started working - this was '92 - first through AID - some emergency relief
                    efforts, just getting food to starving Somalis.</p>
                <p>Meeting after meeting was held in Washington. I was Cohen's note taker and report
                    drafter for much of it. The logistics were daunting. This was a country in civil
                    war. You couldn't find any airport. We managed to get some food in, but the
                    frustrations built because the food kept being stolen by gunmen of various
                    militia factions and you couldn't keep anybody on the ground safe without some
                    sort of security. There was no security. You couldn't make sure the food got to
                    where it was supposed to get to. That frustration built. Working with the
                    Pentagon, we organized a humanitarian relief effort, flying out of Mombasa,
                    Kenya, C130s onto Somali airstrips to unload food. But here, too, as soon as the
                    food was unloaded, the gunmen rode in in their technicals, which are jeeps with
                    machineguns mounted in the back, and stole the food.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Pictures continued to show the famine building. Film crews were able to get in
                    and out. It was a national issue, a national debate going on, by mid to late
                    1992. That was also the election year. George Bush was defeated by Clinton in
                    November. As a final shot, as he's going out the door, Bush decided that he
                    would intervene to stop the famine and send in U.S. military to provide the
                    security.</p>
                <p>That was the key element. We had been debating and going through these policy
                    meetings over and over again. How do we do this without sending in the U.S.
                    military? Nobody wanted to send them in. The answer was, we can't. So then the
                    question became, do we send them in? That was debated round and round within the
                    bureaucracy, particularly the State Department and the Pentagon. Finally, then
                    President Bush decided that he was going to send them in to stop the famine.</p>
                <p>I was deputy coordinator of the task force in the Operations Center a December
                    night as we watched on TV as the first Marines started coming ashore to be met
                    by the TV crews on the beaches of Mogadishu. It went very well the first few
                    months. The troops came ashore. All the bad guys put down their weapons or hid
                    them and behaved for a while in awe of American military power. A large military
                    force secured Mogadishu and enough of Somalia to begin the food distribution. By
                    April of '93, we had sent out a little mission. We had a big UN headquarters set
                    up. The force had become largely UN. We began withdrawing the American troops
                    and turning it over to the UN as a famine relief operation, but the building
                    issue was, what do we leave behind? Do we just say, okay, we've stopped the
                    famine and turn around and leave and the gunmen pick up where they left off? Or
                    do we try to somehow settle the political problems? What became something of a
                    dirty word, “nation building,” do we get into nation building?</p>
                <p>At about that time, the warlords had all been behaving, but Aideed, this one
                    particular warlord who was powerful in south Mogadishu, which was where the UN
                    and U.S. headquarters were, he had been running a radio station that was very
                    important to him. He was probably the only warlord who had a radio station. It
                    was Soviet-style propaganda and it had become increasingly harshly critical of
                    the UN and the famine relief, imputing all sorts of evil designs to this effort,
                    on Somali politics when in fact this effort had no particular designs on Somali
                    politics other than to find something to leave behind that would be responsible.
                    So, the UN started rumbling - and when I say the UN, it was really the U.S.
                    because the UN senior special representative of the Secretary General was
                    Admiral Howe, an American who had been on the Security Council staff, and the
                    deputy commander of the UN forces was an American general and much of the muscle
                    of the UN force was still American - the UN started considering and talking
                    about doing something about this radio station.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Aideed saw that as a threat and in June his militiamen attacked a feeding station
                    that was guarded by Pakistani UN troops. 24 Pakistanis were killed. Then their
                    bodies were mutilated and eviscerated by Aideed's militiamen as a political
                    statement that “We will not countenance this interference. If there is going to
                    be feeding in my territory, I'll do it. You're not going to mess with my radio
                    station.” Aideed was beginning to see this mission as a threat to his chances of
                    taking over Somalia.</p>
                <p>The U.S. and the UN had to respond to that. The question was, how do we respond?
                    The decision was that we could not countenance this. We had to respond forcibly.
                    We would go after Aideed. This is June 1993. That's where the so-called “famine
                    relief effort” stopped and the so-called “nation building” that was later
                    considered a mistake began. From that came the decision, just as I was arriving
                    in July, to try to forcibly hunt Aideed down, as he obviously wasn't going to
                    surrender, and remove him from the scene as a clear enemy to any sort of
                    stability and any sort of new form of government. From that came the decision to
                    bring in a U.S. Ranger force to do this nasty job. They arrived in July.</p>
                <p>I was the deputy in our little imitation American embassy. It wasn't a real
                    embassy because we didn't have a government, so it was called the “United States
                    Liaison Office.” Bob Gosende was the ambassador. I was the DCM. We had a couple
                    of political officers and an AID officer and a few others. Our job was twofold.
                    One was to be liaison with the UN mission and report back to Washington on what
                    they were doing, what they needed, how that was going, and two, to see what we
                    could do to establish some sort of Somali body politic that could carry on and
                    provide a measure of stability and security, nation building.</p>
                <p>What we were not consulted on was this Ranger force, where they should go, what
                    they should do. They came in, set themselves up at the airport, attached a
                    liaison officer to work with us, but made it clear that their security was so
                    important and so based on intelligence that they would only tell us about
                    missions after they happened. That was the case. In retrospect - and this is all
                    the background to “Blackhawk Down,” to the movie and to the events on October 3
                    when this force went in and tried to capture senior leadership of Aideed's
                    faction, They got into an all-night firefight, 18 Americans were killed and the
                    whole U.S. attitude towards humanitarian intervention changed. Our Somali policy
                    changed dramatically and we began backing away from all this. “Nation building”
                    became a dirty word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, we had a policy which was... You came at
                        a time when nation building was in the air.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I think the original thought of the Bush administration had been that
                    this would be humanitarian relief, we'd bring in the food, and then we'd leave.
                    But anybody who thought hard about it, including the Africa Bureau, who had to
                    work out the parameters of this, you had to leave something behind or the same
                    problem was going to come back within days of your leaving. You were going to
                    have the same anarchy and the same gunmen running around stealing food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, how did you find... We had forces on the
                        ground and we had the State Department running a mini-embassy. How did you
                        find relations between the military part of our presence in Somalia and the
                        political side, which was our side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There were some interesting differences. Working there on the ground
                    was not a problem. We were all living in this fortified military camp with
                    frequent firefights at night and mortars and tracer rounds and stuff like that -
                    usually, Somali on Somali, and sometimes Somalis just making sure we knew they
                    were around and didn't like us. So, it was a pretty terrible place in this city
                    that had been absolutely ruined and gutted by more than 2 years of civil war,
                    anarchy, and looting. On the ground we got along fine. I had been in the
                    military and had worked with the military, I understood that world and was not
                    uncomfortable working with military officers.</p>
                <p>CENTCOM command in Tampa was responsible for the mission — remember Schwarzkopf
                    had been the hero of CENTCOM just a year earlier when he led the first Iraq war
                    effort... He had retired and been replaced by General Hoar, who viewed this
                    whole Somalia thing with great disdain. He basically didn't want his soldiers in
                    this messy, non-war footing, getting into things that were not combat. So he had
                    very tight strings on the 2 star General Montgomery, the deputy commander of the
                    UN force and the commander of the U.S. forces - he was the man on the ground -
                    which violated the Powell Doctrine and Powell had just stepped down as Chief of
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Powell Doctrine said you give the man on the
                    ground everything he needs and then you let him do it. Hoar was doing the
                    opposite. He was giving the man on the ground the bare minimum, nipping at every
                    bit of it, and placing strings on it. There weren't any heavy armor or any
                    forces really able to go in and get those guys out of downtown Mogadishu when
                    the Black Hawk went down because Hoar had not allowed them to have any. He also
                    was calling 2 or 3 times a day, keeping all sorts of strings on his general. “If
                    you want to do anything, you have to get it approved by me.” He just didn't like
                    this whole mission. He wanted to get out of it. He wanted to get out of it
                    without any of his soldiers getting hurt. And he wanted it over with. He viewed
                    our embassy with considerable distrust as part of the civilian crowd that had
                    gotten us into this mess in the first place. So, there was a line of friction
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>In Mogadishu, in this walled compound that had been the old embassy compound
                    where we were all camped out, I think relations were good. We were all in the
                    same mess. We all understood each other. There was a very high level of
                    professionalism. Everybody there had come there because they wanted to get this
                    done. They were all volunteers. They all were away from wives and families and
                    the normal comforts of civilian life or even garrison life. It was an impressive
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the NGOs? They were doing the feeding, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There it was very interesting. Some of the NGOs, particularly some
                    like Save the Children, had been operating before this intervention by making -
                    and they had to - tacit alliances with warlords. So, they sometimes tended to
                    take on the coloring of the warlords' attitude. In south Mogadishu, that meant
                    Aideed. So some of them viewed us with distrust, which turned out to be from
                    their point of view justified when indeed we went after Aideed. So there was
                    some friction there. But they needed us. They needed our protection. They needed
                    the food supplies if they were distributing food. In some ways, that
                    relationship was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Jonathan Howe perceived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The thing I remember most about him was that for someone who had been
                    an admiral in the Navy and commanded ships and even fleets, you expected a
                    persona, a forceful, decisive, commanding presence, and he wasn't like that at
                    all. Maybe he had been like that. But in his UN hat and civilian role, he was
                    almost indecisive. He had trouble making decisions. Of course, he was in a
                    difficult position. The Americans wanted to do this. The UN bureaucracy wanted
                    to do that. He had a number of competing clients, as you inevitably do in that
                    situation. They don't all say quite the same thing. But he was not a forceful,
                    dynamic leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at a time when you might say the
                        communication revolution was really beginning to make itself felt as far as
                        being able to... Communications from Washington, how did you find dealing
                        with this, or was this much of a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was a big problem later after October 3rd. Everything changed
                    with October 3rd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October 3rd being when 18 people were killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. To get back to the narrative, it had become increasingly clear to
                    us — us being me, Ambassador Gosende, and a few others — that this was not
                    working, this effort to get Aideed, that they were getting bad intelligence. The
                    vivid example I remember is, they decided they'd spotted a tall, bald, black man
                    in a part of Mogadishu where they could get to him and they went in and took him
                    down thinking they had Aideed, whereas if they had talked to us or anybody who
                    knew anything about Mogadishu, they could have told him that where this man was
                    Aideed couldn't live for 2 seconds. It was on the wrong side of town in Ali
                    Mahdi territory, and obviously it wasn't Aideed. In fact, it was Said Barre's
                    chief intelligence officer and chief torturer from the previous regime, who was
                    then working with the warlord who opposed Aideed, Ali Mahdi. No tears shed that
                    they took him down, trussed him up like a chicken, and hustled him off to be
                    interrogated only to find they had entirely the wrong guy.</p>
                <p>They also jumped into an NGO house and scared the hell out of the usual
                    international staff of several people who hunkered down in a little house in
                    Mogadishu and all these guys come in with helicopters in the middle of the night
                    blowing doors down. They had great machinery, extremely well trained, the best
                    trained soldiers you've ever seen, great technology, and poor intelligence. The
                    intelligence never got good enough.</p>
                <p>We, Gosende and I, by mid-September were talking amongst ourselves and saying,
                    “This is just not working.” Then the second week in September, I drafted and
                    Gosende worked on it and we sent in a cable to the Department saying, “We need
                    to look at this. We need to change it. We need to try a different approach.
                    Maybe we have to talk to Aideed. Maybe we have to start negotiating with him.
                    This approach isn't going to work. We're not going to get him. We're just making
                    more enemies than we are friends. We're wasting resources. Killing a few Somalis
                    who get in the way is not going to work.” Near as we can tell, that cable made
                    no impact. Washington was diverted by other things. I don't know. We never got
                    any comment. Nothing happened. And then October 3rd, 2-3 weeks later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to October 3, were you able to function like an
                        embassy, go out and talk to people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No. By July, when the war against Aideed had started, his people
                    started ambushing convoys and we could not go out without armed escorts. We had
                    a company of FAST Marines. We would go out in an armored car with a HUM-V on
                    either end with a grenade launcher or a heavy machinegun mounted on the HUM-V
                    and a bunch of very heavily armed Marines as escorts. We would drive over to
                    north Mogadishu to talk to Ali Mahdi or wherever to talk to various political
                    figures and warlords. But it was a big production to go out. We had to basically
                    intimidate. We had to make sure we were so fierce that no gunmen would take a
                    try at us. You couldn't walk the streets. You couldn't go out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you negotiate with these people?</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: All with the exception of Aideed, as we later finally concluded, yes.
                    But the exception was Aideed. He really believed that he had overthrown Siad
                    Barre and therefore had a God-given right to rule Somalia. All his allies in the
                    fight against Siad Barre disagreed with him on that. They were scared of him. He
                    was the first amongst equals. He was the stronger but never - and that was the
                    Somali conundrum - they had gone through 2 years of this; they went on through
                    another... They're still at it. He was not strong enough to dominate everybody
                    else, but he wasn't weak enough for anybody to overthrow him. So, you had a
                    stalemate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening out in the countryside by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was reverting quickly to medieval Europe where the regional dukes
                    or warlords would control as far as they could control, as far as they had
                    tribal allies from their clan and militiamen and money to keep the militiamen
                    happy and armed and fed. Then there would be the next local warlord. There would
                    be these areas that were in-between the no man's land and the borders would
                    shift as one got stronger and one got weaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were people getting fed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: People were getting fed after the spring of '92. There were NGOs that
                    had been able to operate. And then we had UN forces that would provide a measure
                    of security. We had the Indians in the south in Kismayu and places like that. We
                    had the Italians in the west along the Ethiopian border. We had UN forces
                    scattered through the country. We got up to 25,000 UN troops and that was able
                    to keep a measure of order, allow the NGOs to operate, and people were getting
                    fed. So we broke the famine and that remains the accomplishment of the mission.
                    The famine was stopped. To this day, there hasn't been a famine like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, were we seeing a separatist movement? I'm of
                        an age when I remember British Somaliland. Was that a different kettle of
                        fish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was. That had already established itself as... It had fought Siad
                    Barre, too, on its own terms. When the civil war broke out in the south,
                    Hargeisa and what became Somaliland became its own little enclave. Instead of a
                    warlord, they had a president and a nominal country, but it was basically
                    another warlord. It was clan based. The Isa clan was one clan that dominated
                    that whole area. And they had reasonable peace and stability there.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. The president wanted recognition and we didn't want to recognize
                    him because it would mean recognizing that Somalia had fragmented into many
                    different pieces. To this day, we have not recognized Somalia for that reason.
                    But we did recognize that he had at least established some measure of stability
                    and that was important, so we did visit. There were NGOs that operated there.
                    There were also some traditional Somali problems. People were occasionally taken
                    hostage for ransom. Shootups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not informed of this Special Operation Force that
                        went in to get Aideed, which became known as Blackhawk Down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Right. That was the name of the kind of helicopter... In the early
                    going of this, the Rangers were intent on taking down a meeting in the Olympia
                    Hotel in a part of central Mogadishu. The troop carrying helicopters were called
                    Blackhawks, still are. In the early going, one and then a second were shot down.
                    So that came the cryback over the radio, that something had gone wrong:
                    “Blackhawk down.” That was what the movie was named after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That afternoon, the Navy commander who was our liaison and was
                    normally a cheery, infallibly optimistic sort, came... I was charg� at this
                    point. Gosende had gone back on leave. I was charg� and he came to me and said,
                    “We're doing an operation in this part of Mogadishu. We think there's a meeting
                    there and there's some important Aideed folks that we can get. But it looks like
                    trouble. We're having trouble. We're getting into a fight.” This was late
                    afternoon. I had seen helicopters going over and so I guessed that something was
                    going on. This was about 2 miles from us and you could hear it. Later that
                    night, I got up on the roof of the embassy. We had taken over the old USIA
                    building, which was very heavily fortified, built back in the mid-'80s. We had
                    taken that over as our embassy. I got up on the roof and I could see the
                    firefight 2 miles away. It was fierce. This was after dark when they were
                    pulling out all the stops trying to extract the people who had been shot down,
                    the crews of those 2 helicopters and the bodies of the soldiers that had been
                    hit. So, I knew we had big trouble. The next morning, the full story came out
                    both to us and to the whole world. When they finally got them out at dawn, 18
                    Americans had been killed. Something like 75-80 had been injured. But from our
                    point of view, worst of all, one American, a pilot named Duran, had been taken
                    hostage. Also, there was the famous footage of the bodies being dragged through
                    the streets that really was political dynamite back here, understandably so.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>A number of things happened very quickly. Gosende, who had been an advocate of
                    the “go after Aideed” policy, was basically not going to be sent back. So, I
                    lost my ambassador. The Clinton administration woke up and decided this had
                    gotten much too nasty much too fast and wanted out. How do we get out? The State
                    Department came up with retired Ambassador Bob Oakley and teamed him with a
                    young, up and coming one or 2 star named Tony Zinni from the Pentagon, and sent
                    them out to try and negotiate with the warlords, negotiate a new political
                    arrangement with the warlords, particularly Aideed, and get the American pilot
                    back. The American pilot was on the cover of “Time” magazine. So the next 10
                    days or so were just frenetic. At the end of those 10 days when we put Oakley on
                    the plane... My embassy had also been drawn down in the course of this to the
                    minimal staffing. It was my attach�, a colonel, and I doing most of the work. We
                    just came back and collapsed in 2 chairs after putting him on the plane. The
                    colonel fell asleep immediately. We had been watching CNN reports on what had
                    happened. We were just exhausted. It was 10 days of intense negotiations and
                    work and now suddenly we were talking to Aideed and Aideed's people. Oakley, who
                    had been the ambassador there in the spring and had had something of a
                    relationship with Aideed, comes across as a craggy West Virginian type. He looks
                    and sounds tough. He and Aideed had some sort of... Aideed was impressed by him.
                    So, he was able to persuade Aideed that basically if Aideed released the pilot,
                    the hunt for Aideed would stop, he would be respected as a player on the Somali
                    scene, they wouldn't be going after him anymore, and in exchange “Give us our
                    guys back and behave.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stop ambushing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. “Stop shooting at us.” That was the tradeoff. After a week or so
                    of shuttling back and forth with Aideed and Ali Mahdi and others and in these
                    convoys with the armored Suburban and the 2 HUM-Vs and all the rest and a number
                    of meetings with Aideed and his people, we got it done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sitting back in our...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, I was with them on most of this. I was there in most of the
                    meetings. Aideed was a remarkable figure. This was the first time I had seen
                    him. Then I saw a lot of him in the next few months. What I remember most about
                    him was his mouth. He was very dark and he didn't have much of a chin and he had
                    a very wide mouth with very white teeth. It always reminded me of a shark. No
                    apparent sense of humor. My way of dealing with Somalis, which generally was
                    quite successful, was to joke and tease with them. They all had a sense of humor
                    and they liked to do that. It's a very verbal society. That's the way they deal
                    with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact, they didn't really have a written
                        language for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No. It was like Vietnamese. It wasn't written until missionaries got
                    there and put it down on paper.</p>
                <p>So that was the tradeoff and that was a tradeoff the administration back in
                    Washington was happy to accept. The other remarkable thing about that was, I
                    pointed out to Oakley that there wasn't just the American that Aideed was
                    holding but there was also one Nigerian soldier who had been grabbed in north
                    Mogadishu by Aideed's folks. So, Oakley took that immediately and when we went
                    to Aideed, he said, “Not only the American pilot, but I need that Nigerian
                    soldier.” We got the Nigerian soldier back when we got the pilot back. It took
                    about 10 days. Nigeria was immensely grateful and the soldier was, too,
                    obviously, that somehow he hadn't been forgotten in the geopolitical rush to
                    deal with the headlines. To Oakley's credit, he picked up on that immediately
                    and made sure we got that Nigerian, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being in the eye of the hurricane? Was
                        the press intrusive? Were people calling all the time from Washington, “Why
                        aren't you doing something?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: All of that. The press was all over the place. I remember particularly
                    Christiane Amanpour mainly because we had a young Marine captain commanding our
                    FAST security platoon, 40 Marines living in the old ambassador's residence. He
                    fell passionately in love with Christiane Amanpour and followed her around like
                    a puppy dog. It was a little hard to separate him. But yes, there was press all
                    over the place. Yes, but Oakley was the spokesman. He basically didn't deal with
                    them much, gave them the bare minimum. That was what they got. But this was big
                    news. I already had a good deal of experience of dealing with the press and
                    learning quickly which reporters did a very serious job and really tried to find
                    out what was happening and why and which reporters were reporting basically what
                    they picked up at the hotel bar from other reporters. You view news
                    organizations with those biases for your remaining years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Washington? Were communications of a nature
                        where they had reached the point where they could call all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. There was a task force set up, of course. The great advantage we
                    had was, we were 10 hours out of cycle with Washington, so basically we did
                    everything in the middle of the night back here. That was our day. I remember
                    that from when I was on the task force back in December. Of course, it was
                    midnight when we watched everybody coming ashore at dawn in Mogadishu. But I
                    would always have a phone call at 4:00 AM Washington time from whoever was on
                    the task force that day and have to go over what we were doing that day and what
                    was going on. I had Dick Moose, the then Under Secretary for Management,
                    constantly on my back, as charg� managing this embassy, over how many people I
                    had in-country, which was fine. It was his job and DS [Diplomatic Security] and
                    the Washington establishment had to set the limits. I insisted it was my job to
                    decide who within those limits I needed. That's where the squabbles came. Moose
                    would periodically try to get me to send somebody out and I'd say, “No, I've got
                    to have that somebody. I'll send So and So out because I can spare that person
                    for the time being. But that one I needed.” I insisted that was my prerogative.
                    He always backed down, but Washington was not a bit averse to trying to run the
                    embassy from 10,000 miles away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reporting? Was there much time to sit down and
                        write cables?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, we had to - at least we felt we had to, being dutiful Foreign
                    Service officers. This was still when... The big peril now is, so much of it
                    goes into e-mail. But this was still a bit pre-e-mail. I think we had the old
                    green WANGs. In the end, we had computers, so I guess we must have had e-mail,
                    but we weren't doing it as a major means of communication. We didn't use the
                    Internet, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel that this was the Clinton
                        administration, which had come into office saying, “It's the economy,
                        stupid” and did not want to get involved in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: They were appalled that this had all happened and embarrassed that
                    they hadn't been paying attention, that this had snuck up on them. Of course,
                    the lesson there is that if you've got American troops deployed anywhere
                    overseas, pay attention because it's a big domestic political issue immediately
                    if anything happens. Every administration should understand that. Most do, but
                    the Clinton administration started off a bit naive, as many do, on foreign
                    policy. This bit them. It was their first real political embarrassment. So, the
                    mop-up brigades were out in strength and that was Oakley's job, to “Tidy this
                    up, get that guy off the headlines out of Aideed's jail back to Walter Reed,
                    that pilot, and get things neat and tidy and no more Americans get shot.” That
                    was basically his informal marching orders, and that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 18 Americans killed and 40-50 or more
                        wounded. A hell of a lot of Somalis were killed, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, some 300. One of the things Aideed learned very quickly was that
                    if he killed Americans, he won with the press and the political war, and if he
                    got Americans to kill Somalis, he won the political war. Both of those were
                    wins. So, it was to his advantage to get as many Somalis killed as he could
                    because he would display the bodies to the press corps, he would say, “Look what
                    those Americans did” and make the most of it. And he had a very good
                    Soviet-style propaganda operation. That was why the radio was so important to
                    him. The main press corps hotel was controlled by him in his territory. He made
                    sure they were safe, secure, and got his version of every event that happened.
                    This all became important later on in another event.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the UN during this time?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I think the UN was traumatized. First of all, this Aideed thing was
                    not something... The UN was very uncomfortable with it. It's not the kind of
                    thing the UN did or understood. It was being done by Americans. The UN wasn't
                    being kept informed. They were very uncomfortable with it. Then all this
                    happened and the UN mission was in danger of going up in smoke in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>After Oakley left, I was charg� for another 2-3 months before they rounded up
                    Dick Bogosian and sent him out as the new ambassador. In that time, we had
                    Oakley for a few more visits with General Zinni and Randy Beers of the NSC...
                    Footnote: one of the intriguing things about General Zinni and about America was
                    that he told me his father had been an Italian soldier in Somalia in World War
                    II. He was a first generation immigrant back in Somalia as a one star and later
                    a 4 star general and commander of CENTCOM himself. He was a very interesting
                    guy. After it was over, I had a new mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about these 3 or 4 months that you were charg�
                        after Oakley left.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: My new mission was, what can we do to patch together some kind of
                    political arrangement that will allow us to get out of here gracefully? I think
                    it was even announced that U.S. troops would withdraw in 6 months, which meant
                    the following March. So, we started working on putting together a conference. As
                    it ended up, the conference was in early December in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
                    Several things involved there. One was getting all the warlords to one place.
                    These guys had been trying to kill each other for 2 or 3 years. They naturally
                    weren't very trusting. Getting them all to the same place was quite a challenge.
                    We finally did get them all to Addis except Aideed. Of course, it wasn't going
                    to work without Aideed. He was the key. We had to get him. So, we went back and
                    forth trying to persuade Aideed. I rounded up an attach� plane that could come
                    down, pick him up in Mogadishu, and fly him to Addis so he could join the party.
                    He was very suspicious of the whole idea, thought we were going to take him up -
                    I can't imagine why - and throw him out of the plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mussolini did that in Ethiopia during the
                        Italian-Ethiopian war. Nobody of that era wouldn't know that, particularly
                        from the Horn of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: He was very suspicious. It took everything we could do to persuade him
                    and even then I was at the airstrip by the plane. He came down with 2 truckloads
                    of gunmen. I have never seen him look so uncomfortable. He was scared. But as we
                    told him over and over again, “The U.S. can't get rid of you. Even if we want
                    to, we can't do it that way.” Sure enough, he got on the plane and went. Then I
                    flew up to Addis and spent a wild night... Of course, Mogadishu was 105 degrees
                    in the shade. There was a ride going up on very short notice, so I went
                    basically in the clothes I was wearing. Addis Ababa is at 8,000 feet. At night,
                    it's very cool. The Ghion Hotel, the old hotel in Addis, is jam-packed with
                    Somali warlords and I'm up there and we had Senator Warner from Virginia and
                    Senator Levin from Michigan there on a CODEL. The UN was running these talks
                    trying to get these guys to come to an agreement. I'm bouncing from hotel room
                    to hotel room most of the night from the Butcher of Hargeisa to the Murderer of
                    Kisamayu, from one thug to another, one warlord to another, as they wheel and
                    deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you communicate with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: In English. All of them either spoke English or had somebody with them
                    who spoke English. Language was never a problem, oddly enough. For southern
                    Somalia, Kenya was the way out and the economics and everything else. They had
                    all learned some English. Some of them - the Butcher of Hargeisa, for example,
                    General Morgan, who had been a general in Siad Barre's forces, married Siad
                    Barre's daughter and had been commanding Siad Barre's effort to absolutely level
                    Hargeisa for being uppity and disagreeing with him - looked like a college
                    professor. He wore a tweed jacket and smoked a pipe. He had this long beard. The
                    one Somali touch was, the end of the beard was a little twiddle of henna, of
                    red, which he would twiddle nervously. That indicated you had done the hajj. He
                    had a very quiet manner. This was a guy who was a feared fighter, a warlord and
                    atrocity committer in the first order, acting like he was doing a literature
                    seminar on the poets of the Lake District. “What do you think of Wordsworth?” I
                    remember another one, too, who always whipped out a bottle of scotch from a
                    particularly obscure corner of Somalia. You wondered, “How did he get that
                    scotch?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about qat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It's a narcotic leaf. That, too, was a big part of the Kenya
                    connection. Although it's grown in Ethiopia and Yemen, it's a highland bush. It
                    has to get there fresh, so there was a major industry in Kenya that would cut it
                    on the slopes of Mount Kenya at 6-8,000 feet, put it in trucks, truck it to
                    Wilson Airport, the small private plane airport outside Nairobi. They would cut
                    it at midnight, load the trucks, get them to Wilson by dawn, load them on the
                    twin Cessnas and these planes would just take off like a carrier flight every
                    day flying up to Somalia. That always worked no matter what was going on. Nobody
                    interfered with the qat trade. They'd land at various points around Somalia,
                    cash on the barrel, issue the qat, and by midmorning in Mogadishu, the Morane,
                    the gunmen, would have their qat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to somebody who was in Yemen who said that the

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Usually they'd get it by lunchtime. You'd have a fight in the morning
                    and then everybody'd call it off in the afternoon to chew their qat. Then maybe
                    they'd resume at suppertime. It was a routine schedule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was coming out of this conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was an attempt to get them to all agree on some sort of arrangement
                    that would lead to a government. They eventually did. They wouldn't let them out
                    of the hotel until they agreed. Then they all went back and within days it
                    dissolved. Then we went at it again more seriously in February and we got them
                    all to Nairobi and did it in Nairobi with Lansana Kuyate, the UN deputy, who was
                    a Guinean, a very gifted diplomat, and who had been quite critical of our
                    approach to Aideed, saying, “We've got to include him. He's got to be part of
                    the deal or it won't work.” We tried that. We had another longer conference in
                    Nairobi in February and this time got another deal. They came back and generally
                    behaved waiting for the last 2 weeks of March when the U.S. troops withdrew. As
                    soon as the U.S. troops were gone, Aideed grabbed somebody else's town south of
                    Mogadishu and it all broke down. That was the killer. When that happened and we
                    began to get rounds of daily interclan fighting again within the city... Our
                    corner of the compound was the boundary between the Medina District, which a new
                    warlord, Musa Sudi, had established himself in, and Aideed's folks above us. At
                    one point we had the firefights going on right around the corner of our wall,
                    guys waving at our Marines in the sentry boxes on the wall, “Hi,” and then
                    they'd fire off a burst, poke around the wall... If it hadn't been so lethal and
                    so sad, it was comical. I think one of the things that particularly affected us,
                    the folks working at the embassy and a couple of young political reporters - 3,
                    in fact - and aid workers and everybody else was that we had gotten to know a
                    lot of Somalis who were and saw themselves as the victims of this, desperate to
                    get on with something resembling a normal life, and they just couldn't get rid
                    of these guys. You couldn't take all the warlords, put them in a bag, and throw
                    them in the ocean. That's ultimately what you needed to do, but nobody could do
                    that, nobody was willing to do that for obvious reasons.</p>
                <p>At the end of March, a big fleet offshore, all the U.S. troops withdraw. So now
                    it's just the UN troops and me and Ambassador Bogosian and our Marines in this
                    compound. And then the fighting starts again, but not with us. It's between
                    them. At that point, we're seeing this and deciding we can't fix this. Bogosian
                    finally leaves, having agreed to do 6 months, period. Dan Simpson comes as the
                    last of my 4 ambassadors in my brief year in Mogadishu. He comes out having
                    talked to everybody in Washington and he doesn't tell me this but his mission is
                    pretty clearly to shut this down. Even I, as the last champion of somehow saving
                    Somalia, have to agree that basically we made two determined efforts to get
                    these guys to reach some kind of agreement. Each time it's broken down. They're
                    not going to do it. There's no point in keeping our people at risk in what's
                    getting to be an increasingly dangerous environment not targeted against us but
                    just the loose fire around. So, in August, we closed the embassy and left.</p>
                <p>I went to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, what did we do with our local employees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Tough one. You give them money and try to help them with visas
                    wherever we can, those that want them. But a number of them stayed and to this
                    day I'm not sure what happened to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a Somali community in the U.S. at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. A lot had fled the civil war in '90/'91. Aideed's son... One
                    of Aideed's wives was in San Diego with her son. Her son was of age, became a
                    Marine, and went over in the first batch of Marines to Somalia until somebody
                    realized, “Wait a minute. This isn't a good idea.” So they sent him back to
                    garrison duty and he finished out his Marine tour. Two years after I left,
                    Aideed was killed and now Aideed's son has replaced him back in Mogadishu as
                    head of the Habir Gedr clan.</p>
                <p>So we decide in June that this is hopeless. We're going to get the U.S. out. I
                    leave at the end of July. I go back to Washington and go into the bureau as
                    Somalia coordinator and spend my first bit there closing down the embassy and
                    getting all the assets out and getting all the people out and making sure all of
                    that's tidied up and the lights are turned off.</p>
                <p>Then, we've still got 15,000 UN troops there on a mission we created, we pushed
                    the UN to do, and they don't know how to get out. They don't have any way of
                    getting out. They don't have ships or planes or anything that can get them out.
                    So I formed a cabal with the Political-Military Bureau, a couple of people in
                    there, and some people at Defense, and we started putting together a group to
                    persuade Defense particularly and the U.S. government in general that we, the
                    U.S., need to make the UN's departure possible. That took about 2 or 3 months of
                    bureaucratic maneuvering. The Pentagon really didn't want anything more to do
                    with Somalia. The whole idea was a dirty word in the Pentagon. From their point
                    of view, all they had done was gotten some people killed and there was major
                    embarrassment. But eventually we were able to persuade the policymakers - and
                    General Zinni was a major hand in this - that this was something that we had to
                    do. We had gotten them in and we had to get them out. Zinni, by then a 3 star,
                    went up fast, commanded it, and I went over and in just about a year later in
                    March we sent in a large Powell-style overwhelming U.S. force offshore and into
                    the beach to secure the beach, evacuate all the UN troops, and then leave. That
                    was the final step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were people involved with the UN able to go out at that
                        time, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Part of the problem with Somalis is, they are extremely tough desert
                    nomads and they are survivors. Those that thought they had no way of surviving
                    in Mogadishu without the UN did indeed find ways to go out. Some of them became
                    UN staff. Some of them became refugees. Some of them got visas to here and are
                    probably here.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working with this group to get the UN out,
                        the UN must have been pounding on the United States to do something about
                        it. At that point, they knew they were leaving, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, yes, they had recognized also that the political reconciliation
                    process was going nowhere, that they weren't able to solve this political
                    problem. And they simply... The UN has no navy. Other than the U.S., there is no
                    country with the naval resources able to do a major offshore evacuation. The
                    other possibility was by air with cargo air but that's very expensive and the
                    airport is right in Mogadishu and a political football that the clans love to
                    fight over, so if you've got nobody on the ground securing it, the planes can't
                    come in. So how do you get the last contingent that's holding the fort out if
                    you do it by air? The answer was to do it by sea. We also did a diplomatic
                    thing. Again Oakley... We went out and talked to all the warlords and said,
                    “Don't mess with this. You'll get what you want. It's over. We're gone. But if
                    we have any trouble with this, anybody shoots at us as we're going out the door,
                    we'll hit you with everything we've got.” That might have been an empty threat.
                    I'm not sure we would have. But they didn't and we got out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back from Mogadishu, did anybody debrief
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had been talking to them on the phone every day. A lot of
                    insecurity. Washington was infinitely nervous they were going to get somebody
                    hurt. I admit, that was my major... I remember the sense of relief when I
                    finally did leave Mogadishu for the last time and got on the little plane down
                    to Nairobi. As we lifted off, I realized that now it's not on my head if
                    somebody gets hurt after a year of being responsible for this group that went
                    from 5 or 6 to 80 to back to 5 or 6 to 80, that was constantly expanding and
                    contracting depending on whether the climate was good or not. It was a constant
                    concern to get my folks through that without getting anybody hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, did you find that Somalia had become
                        in the State Department and in the Department of Defense a really bad word

                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: In the policy level, yes, and then it was immediately reaffirmed
                    because we're talking now spring of '94. I got a couple of weeks leave. I went
                    to Nairobi, where I had my family. I managed to find through Kenyan friends a
                    house and rented a house in Kenya and had my family there because I knew I'd
                    never see them if they were in the States. I'd never get back to the States. I
                    was able to get out of Somalia every month or 6 weeks for a weekend or so and
                    see them in Kenya. I came back and had a couple of weeks off and we went on a
                    safari. As we were driving back from the south towards Nairobi where the
                    international airport is, I see this giant C5A going in and I know immediately
                    that they're evacuating Rwanda because that's what they would be bringing the
                    plane in for and I'd read that the two presidents had been shot down and killed
                    and that the emergency had started in Rwanda. There was just no question that
                    the U.S. would not intervene in that no matter how bad it got at that point
                    because it was so fresh after Somalia and political wounds were such that
                    neither the White House nor the Pentagon would countenance it. It was a
                    political non-starter even though in retrospect it probably would have been
                    relatively cheap and easy to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go? This was '94.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: For the '95 summer cycle... I could go to the War College for a year,
                    which sounded like great fun, write a paper, travel around, and all that. Then I
                    got a shot at being DCM in Lusaka, Zambia, and I thought I'd better take that
                    because it might not be around a year later, so I took that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Lusaka from when to when?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: When I arrived, the ambassador was Roland Kuchel, who had done some
                    African service but also a lot of European service and had been DCM in
                    Stockholm. He got this post and then he retired from that while I was there.
                    Very nice guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: He retired in Vermont. He worked hard... The job in Zambia was to try
                    and keep one of Africa's first elected democracies democratic. The guy who was
                    elected as president, Fred Chiluba, two things: one, he was absolutely paranoid
                    about his predecessor, Kenneth Kaunda, and convinced that Kaunda was somehow
                    going to, even though he had defeated Kaunda rather handily in the election,
                    contrive to come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old was Kaunda by this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Kaunda was in his late 60s. He had been president for 29 years. By the
                    time I left - I used to see him every now and then - his attention span would
                    wander after about 20 minutes. Maybe that's normal. (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Chiluba was not rational... If Kaunda said anything, Chiluba could be guaranteed
                    to overreact and Kaunda knew it, so of course he'd go out of his way to talk
                    about “that little man.” Chiluba was very small, very short. Chiluba hated that.
                    At one point it became illegal to have any short jokes. Kaunda just knew how to
                    needle him and Chiluba would overreact. In the first elections after Chiluba was
                    elected - he was elected in '91 - it was '96, and the big issue for our embassy
                    and for Ambassador Kuchel and for me was to keep Chiluba from somehow ruling
                    Kaunda out of the election. If it was a free and fair election and Kaunda ran
                    and was defeated free and fair, democracy was established. If the opposite
                    happened, if Kaunda was somehow ruled out of the election instead of defeated
                    squarely at the ballot box, as we firmly believed he would have been, then
                    democracy had been subverted, it's not moving forward, and Zambia is
                    backtracking from what had been something of a landmark step in '91.
                    Unfortunately we were not able to persuade Chiluba to allow Kaunda to run. He
                    couldn't bring himself to believe that Kaunda was a spent force, although later
                    results indicated that. So they maneuvered... They declared the former president
                    of the country, who had been president for 21 years, not a Zambian. He was a
                    “foreigner.” Not he but one or both of his parents had been born outside the
                    country. Of course, nobody had birth papers and yes, they might very well have
                    been born outside the country in pre-colonial Africa. But it was unprovable. On
                    those grounds, Kaunda was pushed out of the race. He was declared an illegal
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than trying to make this a cradle of democracy, what
                        were our interests in Zambia during this '95-'98 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Much the same as they are in most sub-Saharan countries, to see the
                    country get on a solid footing and move forward, be reasonably self-sustaining
                    economically and have a reasonably democratic political process. That's our goal
                    in most of Africa where we're not actively worried about either a natural
                    disaster or a human made disaster or stability and security. Zambia is a country
                    with lots of room, lots of arable land, some resources - major copper deposits
                    in the copper mines in the north - some hydropower potential and resources and a
                    relatively small population without major tribal animosities. It has no good
                    excuse for not succeeding except that it never has. The reason it never has has
                    always been human frailty, a failure of government. You can blame the colonial
                    powers, the West, the debt, all that, but ultimately Zambians have failed to
                    effectively govern themselves. Sadly, that continues to be the case. I spent 3
                    years where we were trying to establish democracy. The other major goal of the
                    mission during that time was to get the country to privatize the copper mines
                    before they crashed. The government couldn't sustain them, couldn't keep them
                    operating as a government industry. They were rapidly losing value. We got very
                    close, within an inch, and at the last minute somebody whispered in Chiluba's
                    ear and he decided he could get a better deal and he canceled the deal we had
                    that was available. He ended up 2 years later selling to the lowest bidder at a
                    knocked-down price because they were crashing. So, we failed on both those
                    fronts. In terms of the work, it was a frustrating 3 years that we didn't
                    accomplish either goal. In terms of the living, it's a wonderful part of the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Zambian officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Like many Africans, very welcoming, easy to get to know, and that's
                    always been to me the charm of working in Africa, that it contrasted with Asia,
                    where I spoke Vietnamese and spent a very intense year and a half in Vietnam and
                    never felt I got much beyond the second level of about 10 levels of
                    understanding and getting to know the Vietnamese even though basically I worked
                    with Vietnamese all the time. In Africa, there isn't that layer after layer of
                    cultural defenses. They're much more welcoming, much more open and tolerant and
                    forgiving on a personal level. Africans put up with astonishing things from
                    their own governments and everything else and just soldier on. But tolerance on
                    a political level almost doesn't make sense. That's the problem in country after
                    country where the government cannot accept opposition of any sort and feels it
                    has to be crushed and crushes it until it is overthrown. That's the cycle that
                    we're seeing now in Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about events in the Congo? Were they intruding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. It's the whole northern border. It was the fall of Mobutu and the
                    rebels were sweeping down along the Zambian border. The rebel movement that came
                    originally from the east swept down along the border towards us and across the
                    country and heading to Kinshasa. So, we followed that very closely, did a lot of
                    refugee work, a fair bit of reporting on how the Zambians were responding, and a
                    certain amount of... Part of our concern was, we were going to be the base for
                    evacuation of those Americans who were in the southern half of the country and
                    setting all that up, being in touch with the missionaries and all that, but in
                    fact, in the Congo, it didn't amount to much for us. The missionaries that were
                    still there knew how to get out, knew how to take care of themselves, and they
                    had been through a lot of trouble before. They did a pretty good job of taking
                    care of themselves.</p>
                <p>But one small anecdote from that time. We had a young Belgian officer up from
                    Harare. The Belgians had closed their embassy in Lusaka and made it a regional
                    embassy in Harare, but of course the Belgians still had a large number of
                    nationals in Zaire and he was up trying to organize, get permission from the
                    Zambian government to bring in a Belgian plane to Zambia and bring maybe some
                    paratroopers in to guard it and to help the Belgians evacuate any of their
                    nationals. He basically operated out of our embassy for a couple of weeks trying
                    to get this through the Zambian government. I remember him coming to my office
                    one day and sitting down with a heavy sigh and saying, “Just once I'd like to
                    know what it's like to be an American diplomat.” I said, “Why?” He said,
                    “Because then people return your phone calls. They make decisions. They talk to
                    you.” He had been going 2 weeks with the Zambian bureaucracy and gotten nothing.
                    Nobody would make a decision or even talk to him. It was an insight... With the
                    fall of the Soviet Union when we became preeminent, we were the big player. In
                    every country, no matter how obscure... I remember back even in '85 in Guinea
                    Bissau, which had to be the most obscure country and I had to be the least
                    important embassy there - I wasn't giving them any aid and I wasn't doing
                    anything for them - they still would listen to me. The foreign minister would
                    hear me, would give me an appointment whenever I asked for it. Being an American
                    diplomat was indeed different. No matter how trivial the issue or how little we
                    had to do with it, we were a player. Many other embassies were always scrambling
                    to get into those meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Burundi or Rwanda that was going on at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: First it was Rwanda in '94. Then the Tutsi-led military took over
                    Rwanda and still rule it today. Then when they decided Kabila, the new president
                    of Zaire/Congo had been getting a little too friendly with the Hutus, the “Hutu
                    Genocidaires” as they called them, they organized with Uganda and others the
                    effort to overthrow Kabila. That military effort succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Zambia was off to one side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was the one that produced the refugees and all the rest of it.
                    Meanwhile, Burundi was simmering along in semi-civil war with a beleaguered
                    Tutsi-led government that just this past year has through a peace agreement kind
                    of stumbled on. Now there's a Hutu prime minister as part of the peace
                    agreement. But it's still teetering on the balance as to whether Burundi's going
                    to succeed. I follow that closely because my sister is the CARE director in
                    Bujumbura in Burundi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did events in South Africa play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was interesting. When I had worked in AF/S in the early '90s
                    before Mandela was released, before the end of apartheid, South Africa dominated
                    not only that office but the bureau. As much as 60% of the bureau's, including
                    the Assistant Secretary's, time was spent on South Africa and what I considered
                    related, which was Angola and Namibia. South Africa was a major player in both
                    of those. In the back of my mind, I remembered that. I get to Zambia and now
                    it's the new millennia. Mandela's released. He's president of the post-apartheid
                    government. South Africa really isn't a player. First of all, the ANC had been
                    very closely tied to Kaunda, so Chiluba saw them as the enemy. He didn't like
                    them. So, Zambian-South African relations under Chiluba were very frosty. That
                    made a difference.</p>
                <p>Economically, South Africa was important. South African businessmen were showing
                    up. A brewery came in and bought up a Zambian brewery. I was chairman of the
                    school board and increasingly at the international school we would be getting
                    more and more South African kids from representatives of South African companies
                    coming in. There was a growing economic presence, but the political presence for
                    a while there was stymied. That may have changed now with Mbeki in South Africa
                    and Manawasa as president of Zambia.</p>
                <p>Q: How about with Tanzania? There was a road that was built by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There was a railroad. We built the road but refused to build the
                    railroad, said it couldn't be done. So the Chinese came in and did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: That was another place where I thought one thing and found it really
                    wasn't the case. I had assumed those two ex-British Southern Africa socialist
                    legends of the first wave of independence Nyerere and Kaunda and the countries
                    actually touched each other that there would be a lot of kinship and a lot of
                    similarities and to-ing and fro-ing. There wasn't. Tanzania is basically
                    politically Dar es Salaam on the coast and that's a long way from the western
                    border and the western border is an even longer way from Lusaka, where the
                    Zambian political life is. Politically, Zambia is very much in southern Africa.
                    It deals with Zimbabwe hugely. What happens in Zimbabwe is very important to
                    Zambia both economically and politically and to some degree with Botswana and
                    Namibia and Angola, always worried about Angola and Malawi. That's the world
                    Zambia lives in. It doesn't pay much attention to Tanzania, although its oil
                    comes through Tanzania on the pipeline, the train, and similarly in Tanzania you
                    never hear much about Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mugabe and Zimbabwe? Was this an influence or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This was a tragedy. I talked about how Zambia had no excuse for
                    failing yet had. Zimbabwe on the other hand had plenty of excuses for failing -
                    no real natural resources except arable land, no deposits of much of anything,
                    and a bitter civil war for independence. Yet when I was there, Zimbabwe was a
                    shining success. The infrastructure was in great shape and maintained by the
                    African government. The roads, the rail, everything all worked. Harare was an
                    attractive city. The economy was solid. People had work, had jobs. And people
                    had a feistiness that came out of fighting for their independence. They would
                    object when they thought they were being taken advantage of. We were very
                    impressed by Zimbabwe. Then Mugabe was challenged and his response was
                    oppression rather than “I'm in my mid-70s. It's time to step down.” He has
                    basically almost single-handedly destroyed the country in the 5 years since I
                    left. It's a tragedy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I came back and did 2 years as crisis coordinator, a title Howard
                    Jeeter devised for me, being one of the deputies in the Office of West African
                    Affairs with principal responsibility for Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Liberia,
                    the 3 troublemakers in the office. The other deputy did everything else.</p>

                <p>Today is October 27, 2003. We want to talk about the breakfast coup and the
                    Kaunda Christmas arrest before we move on.</p>
                <p>But I want to go back to Somalia. When you were in Somalia, did you ever run
                    across a military man named Boykin?</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: General Boykin... I'm wondering if he was one of the deputies in
                    command of the Ranger Force. I think he was. The commander was a cigar chewing
                    general named Garrison who in my personal opinion had seen far too many John
                    Wayne movies. He was always ready to charge in, guns blazing, and then think
                    about it afterwards. The results of the mission show that. I think that was the
                    last of General Garrison, October 3rd. Boykin may have been one of his deputies,
                    but I don't remember him specifically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I ask is, Boykin made quite a name for himself.
                        He was in quite a responsible position being responsible for terrorism in
                        the Department of Defense and yet he's been going out talking about-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: “My god's better than your god.” That's what he supposedly told Aideed

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, really? I missed that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put it in diplomatic terms, he sounds like a religious

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: This is a guy whose political opinion should have been kept very much

                <p>MCILVAINE: If he had those opinions and couldn't resist talking about them.
                    Absolutely. It confirms everything the Muslim world has thought about this, all
                    their worst fantasies about us, that we are indeed on some sort of religious
                    crusade to wipe out Islam, forgetting that we went to a lot of trouble to save
                    Islam in Bosnia and Kosovo and some other places.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, let's go back to the breakfast coup.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The breakfast coup... We're in Lusaka, Zambia. The morning routine is,
                    you get up at 6:00. We had 3 children all going to school on the school bus to
                    the American International School. The bus wanders around the Kabalonga area of
                    Lusaka, picking up American kids and taking them out to the school out on the
                    outer fringes of town by Leopard's Hill. You go past the giant graveyard where
                    five funerals are going on every minute of every day because of AIDS. The kids
                    get a little introduction to that on their way to school every day.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, we wake up and I'm just getting up and I hear a burst of machinegun fire
                    outside somewhere, not immediately close but outside. That was followed by more.
                    It's pretty clear that something bad is going on. I get into my shorts and go
                    into the kitchen, where I've got 2 phones, an embassy phone and an outside line.
                    I turn on the radio and sure enough, some disgruntled army officers have taken
                    over the radio station and declared a coup. The military establishment from the
                    state house not very far from my house is beginning to respond. In quick order,
                    I alert the ambassador, talk to the security officer and the Marines at the
                    embassy to make sure the embassy's fine. Nothing's happened there. They are
                    intact. Nobody's leaving or coming in. I then talk to the security officer. We
                    decide to close the school, turn off the school bus so the school bus will not
                    be running around town picking up kids while this is going on. We then talk to
                    the consular officer to make sure that he in his house in touch through the
                    warden net with all the American citizens to make sure they're safe and stay
                    home and stay low while we wait to find out what this is. Keep the ambassador
                    informed, who is about a mile from my house at her residence, talking to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Arlene Render. Then get with the political officer on the phone again.
                    Nobody's leaving their house. That's my rules. I try and figure out what's going
                    on. Meanwhile, I get some visitors from an old friend who had been one of
                    Kaunda's stalwarts but was now somewhat on the outs with Kaunda but also on the
                    outs with the government because he was of the old UNIP elite from Kaunda's
                    party. His son and several children arrive at my door figuring that somebody
                    might go after them and they'd be much safer at my house. We let them in.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>By this point, my kids are up and everybody's having breakfast. My kids are
                    really excited because this is like a snow day in Washington. School's canceled.
                    This is great. So it became forever after “having a coup day” when the busses
                    were canceled and school was canceled. This is terrific. They play with the
                    Zambian kids. That's fine. I spend the next 3 hours in the kitchen on those
                    phones keeping the ambassador informed, who's talking to Washington and managing
                    the embassy community until we determine that the danger is over when around
                    lunchtime the coup is suppressed, the coup plotters are captured by the
                    government, and the gunfire has stopped. Business goes back to normal. But it
                    was a pretty exciting morning, particularly for the kids.</p>
                <p>Christmas morning, my wife and I are stalling as long as possible because all the
                    presents are by the tree in the living room and that's our family tradition to
                    delay it and build up the anticipation. The kids are knocking on the door and
                    saying, “It's time to get up.” Finally we start to get up and the phone rings.
                    It's the political officer informing me that the government has surrounded
                    Kaunda's house and is about to arrest him. This is not a big surprise. We knew
                    Chiluba was obsessed with Kaunda and had been threatening to arrest him on
                    various dubious treason plots and that sort of thing. He just couldn't stand the
                    idea of Kaunda out there making critical and snide remarks about Chiluba, which
                    Kaunda was quite given to doing. So indeed he was arrested, but Chiluba had to
                    pick Christmas morning to do it, to arrest the former president of the country
                    and an internationally known figure. Nothing could have served Kaunda's
                    political purposes better. This gets him back into the headlines. It makes him a
                    player again when he had basically been forgotten. A gross miscalculation on
                    Chiluba's part.</p>
                <p>Two days before, I sought out a meeting with a contact of mine who lived a couple
                    of doors away who was Chiluba's Mr. Inside, his lawyer and minor cabinet
                    minister with an office at State House and definitely Chiluba's confidant. I had
                    said to him, “Don't do this.” Rumors were flying. “This will hurt you in all
                    sorts of ways. It can't possibly do you any good.” He was very uncomfortable
                    answering. It was clear that he understood what I was saying, probably agreed,
                    but that something was going on. So, we had thought this might happen. We hadn't
                    thought he'd be so clumsy as to do it Christmas morning, but indeed he was. So,
                    instead of going under the tree and opening up the presents, I spent the next
                    hour or so with the political officer talking to a few people and then reporting
                    back to Washington and talking to some poor deputy assistant secretary of State
                    for African affairs who's been called by the Operations Center to tell them all
                    what's going on and what has happened and whether we think this will be a threat
                    to the embassy. The answer to that was, “No.” Indeed there wasn't any. But it
                    did make an unusual Christmas morning. I called the Ambassador who was on
                    vacation in Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Let's talk about communications. The world is
                        changing. How did you report back when you had these quick breaking
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We didn't have classified e-mail, which I think now many embassies do
                    have - maybe all. So, we didn't do any of this in e-mail. That's the plague of
                    embassy life now. It gets into e-mail and therefore it's not really documented.
                    You don't have files of e-mail. It was already then a major problem with AID. So
                    much of the decision making was being done... They operate unclassified, so much
                    of their decision making was being done in e-mails. There was no record of it.
                    We were constantly forcing the reluctant AID to actually write a cable about
                    that so that we had a record. Everything that required a decision, everything
                    that was a major policy, had to be a cable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But e-mail is technically the same as a cable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, the cables were encrypted and everything else. E-mail wasn't
                    then. It was accessible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But be that as it may-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Hackers can get into your e-mail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if a coup was going on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: You're not talking about classified things. You're talking about a
                    security threat to the mission and the people in the mission. That you deal
                    straight with the Operations Center over the telephone and you issue warnings to
                    American citizens. It's part of every one of these things. Whenever something
                    like this happens, you have to do one of these warnings that go out to the whole
                    world.</p>
                <p>Q: But with e-mail, you can keep records.</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: You can. Maybe now they do, but in my time nobody did except when
                    there was an investigation like Oliver North and they'd go back and they'd dig
                    out all his e-mails out of the computer. You can find them if you know what
                    you're doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you can also print out e-mail.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: But people don't usually do that. I'm sure this is all changing. It's
                    going to have to change because, yes, more and more business, it's much easier
                    to do it by e-mail than the cumbersome machinery of you put a cable together,
                    you take it, you have a couple of people whose whole job is to run all that
                    fancy coded machinery in a windowless room in the embassy and send all these
                    cables out and get in Washington's traffic, most of which we could have done
                    without, as any embassy will tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But the problem with e-mail is that it often brings
                        things down to the unvetted area where people are working at a lower level
                        but it does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Right. It raises control issues that makes any ambassador nervous,
                    particularly when you're talking about the management of U.S. policy, which is
                    his or her job. You don't want everybody in the embassy just chiming in. You
                    want something of a coherent... That's understandable. And the cable process
                    allows that. E-mail does not. So, I would think, yes, classified e-mail presents
                    a number of management challenges that I did not have to face because we didn't
                    have it. We still basically communicated by cable. In a crisis, yes, it's by
                    telephone to the Operations Center or if the telephones aren't working you would
                    set up radio links. Many a time in the Operations Center we would set up an open
                    line to the embassy in countries with bad telephone communications and you'd
                    have over in the corner on the table an open telephone so that whenever we
                    wanted to ask the embassy a question, there would be somebody there monitoring
                    it. We'd go over and ask them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll move on to '98 to 2000. You were in African
                        Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had arrived in the Office of West African Affairs. Something like 10
                    days after I arrived, there was a firefight at the embassy gate in Monrovia.
                    This was September of 1998. A Liberian dissident is shot and dies inside. He
                    gets through the gate and into the embassy. We have on our hands President
                    Taylor's noisiest local critic who has escaped into the embassy. We have outside
                    the embassy with Taylor's not very well disciplined troops ready to shoot at us
                    or him or anybody who comes out the door. They had gone to his house to shut him
                    down and he had gotten wind of it, fled to the embassy with several stalwarts
                    got into the embassy gate about the same time that all their guys, the
                    government's soldiers, showed up. There had been a standoff for a while as he
                    cowered behind a little shield. The embassy gate had been shut and we refused to
                    let him in. We didn't want any part of what was a domestic political fight.
                    Then, somebody, one of the government soldiers or police or militia or something
                    like that, reached around this little barrier and fired a couple of rounds.
                    Well, that did it. The gate guards opened the gate. The guy they were after
                    rushed in with several of his colleagues. The last guy to rush in was the one
                    who was shot and he died as the gate was slammed behind him on our grounds. As
                    far as I know, to this day, he is buried on the grounds of Embassy Monrovia. So,
                    we had a crisis. We went to the Ops Center and we had one of those open lines to
                    the embassy over in the corner. The question was, we had to get this guy out of
                    our embassy and out of Liberia and if we pushed him out the door obviously he
                    was going to be killed on the spot right in front of the embassy, so we couldn't
                    do that. We had to get him out. We finally, after much rapid fire negotiation
                    mainly done by Howard Jeeter, the Nigerians agreed to take him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Nigerians had a force there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The Nigerians had an ECOWAS force there that had gotten more involved
                    in local politics and was no longer seen as neutral. They had brought this guy
                    back, so they bore some responsibility for him even being there. He had been in
                    exile. They had brought him back. Taylor had decided this was a threat to him -
                    and probably rightly so. Taylor went after him. He ran to the embassy gate. So,
                    the Nigerians agreed to take him, but we had to figure out a way to get him out.
                    It was about ten days of hectic negotiations with the Taylor government, the
                    standoff at the embassy gate, the embassy shut down, the police and soldiers
                    outside the gate, guns leveled, threatening periodically to fire on the embassy.
                    Then in the middle of all that, some 20 of this guy's followers snuck up one
                    night and climbed over the fence and landed in the embassy. So we had an
                    additional 20 that nobody knew about. We finally got agreement to get them all
                    out from the Taylor government. We helicoptered them out. We had another very
                    uneasy 6 to 8 months getting beyond that. It had been very clear shortly after
                    he was elected in '97 in a fairly democratic election but he had been elected
                    mainly by assuring the Liberian people that if they didn't elect him, he'd raise
                    hell and kill a lot of people, so they might as well elect him. That was a
                    successful campaign for him. He did win a vote. He was elected and proceeded to
                    run the country like the warlord he is and was.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Nothing whatsoever was done for poor destroyed Monrovia. No water. No power.
                    Ruined buildings and refugees living in them. It actually even looked worse than
                    Mogadishu when I saw it in '98. He went about supporting the RUF and the war in
                    Sierra Leone and extracting diamonds and doing things like that rather than
                    trying to rebuild and govern his country. We weren't on good terms to begin
                    with. This made it even worse. We had a very stiff 6 to 8 months, part of which
                    I went out with Deputy Assistant Secretary Vicki Huddleston and we delivered one
                    messages and we had this surreal 3 hour interview with Taylor. You'd come in
                    from Roberts Field from the airport through this ruined town. “City” is a bit
                    much. It was a big town where refugees are living in the ruins. Then you go on
                    one end of town up on this point, and there is the embassy behind this huge
                    fence. This embassy, the residence, the houses, are all in one compact unit
                    which was actually very handy with all the security problems. It was very
                    defensible. It had ocean front. You could get to it from the ocean or by
                    helicopter. It was very useful for all the problems we had.</p>
                <p>Then, we go to meet with Taylor and we go to this building, the presidential
                    offices, which is a big 7 story high rise with a big park in front that was sort
                    of semi-mowed. We drive in and there is this open air breezeway. You can see
                    right through the building where you go in. There's the ocean on the other side.
                    You walk a long set of stairs to this quite impressive place. There is a
                    Liberian soldier sound asleep on his back. You step over him and go into the
                    offices of the presidency. Of course, the offices were decorated in the fashion
                    that in Somalia I had taken to calling “Abdi XIV,” would-be Louis XIV gilt,
                    incredible armchairs that look like they might do well for Halloween but you
                    wouldn't want to have them in any house you ever owned. We had this long meeting
                    with this guy who is a wily, ruthless, Third World warlord and not a president
                    at all. He wasn't even making much of a pretense of it. He would sort of make a
                    run at it and then decide it was too boring and no fun and wasn't getting him
                    anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the subject of the conversation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was the post-shootout at the embassy gate and an attempt to
                    establish with him what our concerns were, that basically he wasn't making any
                    progress on governance, on helping Liberia, and how he was continuing to mess in
                    his neighbors' countries and we didn't like that and would he please stop? He
                    listened to all that, argued with it, and didn't. Five years later, he was
                    finally pushed out this past summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing about the American interests in
                        Liberia? Were we looking for ways of getting out and drawing down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The American interests had long since been ruined in the years of Sam
                    Doe and then the 10 years of civil war after Sam Doe. The big Firestone rubber
                    plantation had been sold to Bridgestone to the Japanese. Even that had been
                    pretty well shut down by civil war and anarchy. There were a few odd
                    investments. Towards the end, Pat Robertson, the Virginia cable evangelical
                    crusader, supposedly bought this gold mining franchise. Of course, he never got
                    to mine the gold. It was some deal with Taylor and that meant that Robertson
                    ended up defending Taylor a few times as a reasonable sort, something along the
                    lines of “Here we are off coddling Muslims around the world and here's a good
                    Christian president and we're not treating him nicely.” Well, Taylor is Pat
                    Robertson's idea of a good Christian- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had communications facilities. Were they gone by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We did. VOA had a major transmitting center. That had been destroyed
                    in the civil war and we had established a new one in Botswana and one in Sao
                    Tome, Principe, the little islands off Gabon. I saw the ruins outside Mogadishu.
                    We also had some intercept facilities which were also ruined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any American government interests there
                        anymore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: We don't really. The interest - and this was particularly hard to
                    grapple with - is that the United States essentially created Liberia. We were
                    there at the founding. It was our idea. This was going to be the home for
                    returned slaves. It was a fashionable idea in the 1820s-1840s. Indeed they did
                    return and they set up... There is a county named Maryland. There is all sorts
                    of American echoes in Liberia, including the flag, which looks like our flag
                    except it has one star. Liberians believe that they have this kinship with the
                    U.S. and the U.S. somehow will be there when they need it. Unfortunately, we
                    usually aren't. But the belief holds firm and many Liberians have dual
                    citizenship. Many live here. Many have relatives here. There is a large Liberian
                    community in Rhode Island and several other parts of the country. There's one
                    near Washington. There is a very special relationship with Liberia that was
                    always difficult to grapple with. Liberians were always appealing to us in an
                    almost paternalistic fashion. We on the frontlines of West African affairs
                    didn't have the resources or the intention or the interest of hardly anybody to
                    put serious resources in there to fix the problems, so we would cobble together
                    these West African peacekeeping forces and try to keep them in the field with a
                    little help. That was about the best we could do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Ultimately no. We didn't have any resources to throw at this and
                    obviously the U.S. government was not going to use U.S. military power in
                    Liberia... That was out. There was no serious money to pay for anybody else to
                    go into Liberia or to do anything. So, we hoped to appeal to Taylor's desire to
                    be a world statesman, to be treated like a world statesman, and to be welcomed
                    to the UN and things like that, play the scene. That had a little leverage. He
                    would behave for bits. Sometimes he actually helped out - which was telling -
                    like when we had problems with the RUF in Sierra Leone, who Taylor had largely
                    created and supported but denied he had anything to do with them. When they had
                    taken a sizeable UN peacekeeping contingent hostage, Taylor basically got them
                    to free them, which did several things. One, it showed from Taylor's point of
                    view that he's a major league player in the region. He can deliver. He really is
                    somebody to talk to, somebody we should be dealing with all the time. Two, it
                    confirmed all our worse fears that indeed he was pulling all the strings for the
                    RUF anyhow and if he said “Go,” they went. If he said “Stop,” they stopped. So
                    it was a double edged sword. The RUF are the people who chopped off forearms of
                    little girls and committed horrific atrocities with no apparent ideology other
                    than loot. They terrorized Sierra Leone for a decade. That was another one of my
                    problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sticking to Liberia, was Qadhafi playing a role

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Well, yes. He was Taylor's one consistent outside friend. Taylor and
                    the RUF leader, had gone to one of Qadhafi's training camps in the '80s with
                    several other African troublemakers, so there was a link there and that was
                    probably where he was getting his arms through another Qadhafi friend, Blaise
                    Compaor�, the president of Burkina Faso. Right to the end, Taylor was able to
                    get arms through that channel even despite UN arms embargos and everything
                    else.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes, we were. I spent an awful lot of time... In my later job... A
                    little bit in West African Affairs because I had started with my then boss,
                    Howard Jeter. The effort to do something about so-called “conflict diamonds...”
                    The poster child for that were the little girls in Sierra Leone who were having
                    their arms cut off so that Taylor and the RUF could control the diamond trade
                    and the terrorized populace would not interfere with them. Then when I was
                    working Congressional Affairs, I worked long and hard on the legislation there
                    to get a bill through that the administration agreed with that did not punish
                    legitimate African diamond producers like Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana
                    while doing something to impede as realistically - we were never going to
                    totally stop the trade in diamondthe trade in illegal diamonds from Zaire,
                    Congo, and from Sierra Leone. In the end, a bill was passed, signed by the
                    President into law in 2002 and is in force now and I think that has done some
                    good. It hasn't solved the problem entirely. You can't do that by-</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: But it also scared the diamond industry here and the diamond industry
                    in Antwerp, scared them to the bones, because the American market is about 50%
                    of the world market and they envisioned - the Global Witness and some of the
                    other NGOs that were talking about it - that the campaign would show little
                    girls with their arms cut off saying “Diamonds are not a girl's best friend” and
                    horrific public relations and a taint put on all diamonds, a boycott on all
                    diamonds of any kind-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like fur coats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Like fur coats had done in the past. That was the nightmare scenario.
                    That was a nightmare for us, too, because it meant that a few countries that
                    were managing their diamonds very well and relying heavily on the revenues -
                    Botswana, South Africa, and Namibia - would be badly hurt also. So we were
                    trying to protect them yet deal with the problem. It took a lot of working with
                    Ways and Means Committee, with the U.S. Trade Representative, and Treasury,
                    Customs, and the Department of State to keep this team from going off in
                    different direction and keep it together for a couple of years to get that bill
                    through. We did get something reasonably good at the end of that line.</p>
                <p>Taylor was buying his weapons and fueling his run as a warlord and keeping the
                    RUF going on the diamond trade.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to Nigeria. What was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: In the spring of 1998, Sani Abacha suddenly died, the military
                    dictator. That meant that for the first time in 16 years, there was a chance to
                    bring Nigeria back into the family of nations and maybe build something new. So,
                    we worked long and hard with General Abubakar, who took command and who
                    committed himself to elections the following year and a transition to civilian
                    government. We worked long and hard with him to make that transition stick. We
                    spent a lot of time on that. There, we could muster some government resources
                    and visitors... Jesse Jackson took several trips out to cajole all the players
                    and get everybody on the team, something Jesse's very good at. In the spring of
                    '99, Nigeria did hold a chaotic election and there was a fair bit of fraud and
                    vote buying and intimidation and all the rest, but the end result was something
                    democratic. Obasanjo was elected president. He was just reelected last year to
                    his second term.</p>
                <p>It's still a long way from being fixed, Nigeria. The problems are still enormous.
                    Corruption is still a major problem. The police, the judiciary are broken. Years
                    of military rule and corruption and they're not fixed yet. It's a long way to go
                    before Nigeria is a fully functioning, normal country. But anybody who deals
                    with West Africa, Nigeria is so big and the influence is so overwhelming that...
                    It has something like 120 million people, something like a fourth of the total
                    population of Africa. It has the Muslim-Christian-animist splits in spades. It
                    has the ethnic divisions in spades. It has all the problems of everywhere in
                    Africa. Plus, it has resources - the oil - misused in many cases, stolen and
                    what have you. If it fails, it can pull down the whole region. The chaos that
                    can come out of Nigeria is appalling to consider. There are all those people...
                    As it is, Nigerians are inventive, entrepreneurial, and too much of that is
                    spent on criminal activities-</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: They are very clever. Jails all over the world are full of Nigerians.
                    There are Nigerian communities all over the world that find the niche. In Kenya,
                    they kite checks because there is no penalty on overdrawing a check, so they've
                    got a whole check kiting industry and they've done all sorts of damage there.
                    Other places, they run the drug trade. They don't manufacture the drugs or
                    produce them, but they move them. If that enterprise could ever be turned to a
                    productive thing, Nigeria would be unbelievable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about using Nigeria as a military international
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I had a lot to do with that. Very interesting.</p>
                <p>Let me add one thing about Nigerians. I first worked with the Nigerian military
                    in the Congo in 1961. Then I worked extensively with the Nigerians in this
                    period, '98-2000. without reservation, they are the most interesting, charming,
                    and at the same time obnoxious and frustrating people in the world. One
                    shouldn't draw national stereotypes, but Nigerians are something else. That
                    criminal activity is just a reflection of this creativity gone wrong. It gets
                    channeled off. There's no productive way to use it in Nigerian society.</p>
                <p>The military. One of the things anybody who thinks about Africa in the last 20
                    years has been looking at is ways for Africans to solve their own problems
                    because clearly the outer world's attention span is limited, resources are
                    limited, willingness to fix African problems are limited. And Nigeria has been
                    in the forefront of the “We should take care of our own problems. We don't need
                    you” a healthy attitude. The Nigerian military is large. It once was very
                    professional, British trained, and excellent and started in all the UN
                    peacekeeping roles of the '60s. It has actually fought a civil war, the Biafra
                    war. It has more combat experience than any army in Africa. Under Abacha - this
                    was the one thing Abacha did that was actually positive - he committed the
                    Nigerian military to West African run peacekeeping operations in Liberia first
                    and then in Sierra Leone. The results were mixed. By this point, Abacha himself
                    had pillaged the military. They weren't getting any new equipment or training or
                    much of anything. The example that was being established in northern Nigeria
                    was, everybody for himself, grab whatever you can. So, the Nigerian military
                    both in Sierra Leone and Liberia had a reputation for meddling and for
                    corruption and for bad business deals and for getting involved in all sorts of
                    things they shouldn't have, but they also suffered casualties and did fight,
                    unlike anybody else western or African or anybody else, who tended to avoid
                    conflict completely. They took casualties. A lot of Nigerians died so that there
                    would-be some semblance of peace and order in the so-called “Arc of Crisis” of
                    West Africa, which is Sierra Leone-Liberia-Guinea.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>We spent a lot of time... Again, because the resources and the attention were so
                    limited, it is not something the Clinton administration was going to put a lot
                    of money into. We spent a lot of time cobbling together this peacekeeping force
                    to hold the peace particularly in Sierra Leone once we had gotten negotiations
                    started between the government and the RUF to come to some kind of settlement.
                    That settlement did come in the infamous Lome Accord of 1999, infamous because
                    we had no real military backup for it. We just had the Nigerian peacekeepers in
                    Sierra Leone and were having trouble keeping them in the field because Nigeria
                    couldn't support it. We had been providing through contractors logistical
                    support for it. Every couple of months, we had to get some new money. Senate
                    Appropriations hated it and always gave us a hard time. The administration was
                    unwilling to make much of a fight for it. Finally, the Nigerians said they were
                    leaving and did. They just weren't being supported. The RUF, when it came to the
                    crunch where they would actually have to disarm, decided there was nobody in the
                    way, they'd make a run at it. In June of 2000, they did. There was a great
                    panic. It looked like Freetown would go under for the second time. RUF got right
                    up into town and burned the Nigerian embassy next door to our embassy. I
                    evacuated our embassy 2 weeks earlier in Christmas '99. I had a problem with
                    Christmas. Three Christmases in a row went completely awry with first Kaunda's
                    arrest, then evacuating the embassy in Freetown, and then Cote d'Ivoire's coup
                    on Christmas Day the next year. So, for those who are planning to be Foreign
                    Service officers, your holidays are not sacrosanct. Anyhow, the RUF nearly came
                    in. We had to cobble together a whole new arrangement.</p>
                <p>But this time, the disaster got everyone's attention and we had some senior
                    policymaking attention and we had some resources. So, then Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs Pickering went out to talk to Obasanjo, the president of
                    Nigeria. We got some Pentagon backing. They agreed - this was late Clinton
                    administration - that they would provide training. So, Obasanjo agreed he would
                    provide 3 battalions. We would send in the Special Forces. We would train them
                    in lethal operations. This was called “Operation Focus Relief.” We did this in
                    the summer and fall of 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why weren't the British doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: The British meanwhile, this was their former colony, so they had first
                    response, they were training the Sierra Leone military and sending in SAS, their
                    own troops. That stabilized the situation for the moment and stopped the RUF
                    advance. Put the RUF back into the bush. Meanwhile, we were building this
                    Nigerian force that would be the centerpiece of a UN peacekeeping force to hold
                    the peace. That worked. We did train 3 battalions and they loved it. The
                    Nigerian soldiers really enjoyed being treated and trained as real professionals
                    for the first time in decades and they performed very well. Some of those troops
                    this summer were back in Liberia 10 years later and are there now to the
                    transition from Taylor to some sort of democratic government. But the end result
                    of all that was, after the crisis of 2000, a UN peacekeeping force, did
                    establish a peace that lasted. The RUF collapsed, fell apart, into bickering
                    factions, and an election was held. The RUF lost disastrously. Now, we have a
                    pretty solid peace and a shaky democracy in Sierra Leone. We have finally
                    Charles Taylor out of Liberia and a transition started there towards some
                    post-Taylor government. Maybe we can get something more positive there.</p>
                <p>The next problem in that neighborhood is Guinea, where Comte, who has been
                    president for a long time, is in not very good health. There is no clear idea of
                    what the transition is going to be there.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Nigeria is still struggling along, hasn't fallen apart yet, that's the
                    good news. The bad news is, it hasn't fixed most of its problems either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an implied agreement that we're talking about
                        the problems in Anglophone West Africa... The francophone West Africa, the
                        French, that was their baby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: In the course of all this, my third Christmas was the coup in Cote
                    d'Ivoire, francophone. There, I found myself in the Operations Center on
                    Christmas Day. This was 2000. General Geue led a military coup that had taken
                    over the government. I remember 2 things. One, we called Lannon Walker, the
                    former ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire who was retired, and said, “What do you know
                    about this guy?” He knew lots about him and had some very definite opinions
                    about him. Then the rest of the time, we were in touch with the Elysees in
                    Paris. The real question was, what are the French going to do? The French had
                    20,000 French citizens in the country and they had 400 French troops at the
                    airport, something of a base. It was clear that the French were going to take
                    the lead. This was their baby. They had citizens at risk. We were going to maybe
                    try and nudge them in what we thought was the right direction but we were going
                    to be the caboose on that train, and we were, and we are today. The rebellion
                    renewed this past summer. There are now French troops holding a cease-fire line
                    across the middle of the country between the northern rebels and the southern
                    government. The French made it clear that Cote d'Ivoire was their problem. The
                    British took the responsibility for Sierra Leone. Liberia everybody said was
                    ours.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>That came to a focus this summer when Taylor was besieged and his government was
                    collapsing. A West African peacekeeping force was being put together. Would the
                    U.S. lead it and participate? We temporized and we fussed and we ended up
                    sending a Marine expeditionary unit to hover offshore in their ships. A couple
                    of hundred went ashore briefly, which was a response that did not satisfy the
                    West African and the Liberian demand for intervention nor the neocons and the
                    conservative view here that we should never intervene in a messy thing like that
                    in Africa, we shouldn't risk American lives. So, I don't know that the
                    administration won any points but they got away with it. The transition went
                    through. Taylor did leave. Nothing terrible happened. No Americans got shot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should talk about during this
                        '98 to 2000 very active time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was very busy. There were an awful lot of evenings when I got home
                    after everyone in my family had gone to bed to a dark house. That wasn't real
                    popular on the home front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in 2000?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Then, I moved to Congressional Affairs and the African portfolio in
                    H.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I did that for 3 years. I started right in the last few months of the
                    Clinton-Gore administration. Congressional Affairs inevitably is very heavily
                    political and a lot of Schedule Cs. Everybody left. The few survivors had to
                    pick up the pieces. It was kind of like a game of Risk where you conquer the
                    world. At one point, I had Africa, South Asia, and Asia. I had at least 2/3 of
                    the world's land mass and most of its population that I was responsible for. I
                    did South Asia and Africa for a good 8 months. That was the 8 months that
                    included 9/11. So, I was doing South Asia, which includes Afghanistan, when that
                    blew up. I was kept busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the transition. Did you have the
                        feeling that here was the Bush II administration was coming in - you were
                        dealing with it at the political level, dealing with Congress - that it sure
                        as hell didn't want to get involved in anything when it came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Yes. The difference between the 2 parties on foreign affairs is
                    considerable. Many Republicans' view foreign affairs with suspicion and distrust
                    as something that is dangerous, messy, untidy, and potentially expensive.
                    Democrats on the other hand, are foreign policy buffs and are activists from the
                    NGO world and all that and think there's all sorts of things we should do
                    overseas that may not always be wise. So, there is a clear division in attitudes
                    towards foreign affairs between parties. The people who left, the democratic
                    political appointees, were 30-somethings that had come to Washington to do
                    politics and gotten into foreign affairs and they were political junkies. The
                    folks who came in, the new Schedule Cs from the Bush administration, the low
                    level guys, were campaign kids, who had been advance men and campaign
                    functionaries and they wanted to work in Washington for the first time. Foreign
                    affairs sounded kind of interesting, might be fun. Most of them had no
                    experience at all and not much information. They were bright kids. They quickly
                    learned. It was not brain surgery. They quickly became useful. But it was
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Assistant Secretary for
                        African Affairs Susan Rice? What was her presence like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Very considerable. Susan was very young then, in her early 30s,
                    extremely bright, very knowledgeable, but she had never worked in an embassy. As
                    far as I know, she'd never lived overseas. In my personal opinion, she was too
                    quick to jump on things and not terribly wise. Maybe that's an old man talking,
                    but she didn't stop sometimes to think about the repercussions. One example of
                    this “action at all costs” approach was that she was constantly outrunning the
                    resources and the political will behind her, doing things that the resources
                    weren't there for and the political will wasn't there for. One case where the
                    resources and the political will were there, but I think we did overplay it was
                    with Nigeria and with Obasanjo, where at her direction, this was going to
                    succeed and we were going to do everything. In his first year as president of
                    Nigeria, we had something like 9 Cabinet officers, including the Secretary of
                    State, visiting. No African president gets that kind of attention. It tarnished
                    him. It meant that this clammy embrace of the U.S. government - every time you
                    turned around there was another big U.S. official visiting Abuja and proclaiming
                    democracy in Nigeria - we overdid it. As a result, Obasanjo felt he didn't have
                    to take some of the tough decisions he probably should have taken. As the end
                    result, the process has not moved as far and as fast as it could have. Then with
                    the change of administration, we probably went to the other extreme, totally
                    ignoring Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Assistant Secretary when the new
                        administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Walter Kansteiner. I worked with him extensively. I knew him before. I
                    knew him when he was in the first Bush administration National Security Council
                    working on Africa. He then worked with Brent Scowcroft, who had been his boss at
                    the NSC. During the Clinton years, he worked for Scowcroft doing African venture
                    capital and trade and investment consulting, apparently quite successfully,
                    particularly in Southern Africa. I like him. I think he's a good hand and he's
                    very much of the Powell camp, a moderate, thoughtful Republican, not of the
                    neocon Wolfowitz-Rumsfeld camp. In fact, I've heard him voice his frustrations
                    over that and what that's doing to policy. He is leaving in another month,
                    resigning. I took him through the confirmation process in my job as the
                    congressional liaison. He lives in Virginia Piedmont near where I'm from, so I'd
                    known him out there. He has movie star looks - 6'2”, wavy blond hair, blue eyes,
                    this sort of thing - and lots of charm. Plus, he's very bright. He does have a
                    good understanding of Africa.</p>
                <p>If this Sudan peace process gets through, that will be his monument. He has
                    worked that long and hard from the start in what looked impossible 3 years ago.
                    How can you possibly get these 2 sides with the levels of mistrust to ever talk
                    to each other and ever agree on anything? This is the Muslim north and the
                    Christian south, the rebellion that's been going on off and on for 50 years. He
                    almost has that settled. They've got a couple more tough issues to work out.
                    Secretary Powell was just there in the last week. He wouldn't have been going
                    there if it didn't look like it could work. He was there to put the final shove
                    into the participants. So, Kansteiner has done very well on that.</p>
                <p>Probably his biggest frustration has been Zimbabwe and Mugabe, this country he
                    knew and cared about and had been to many times. I voiced some of my
                    frustrations. It was just such a tragedy to see a country that worked so well
                    under Mugabe fall apart when Mugabe just refuses to move on and starts taking
                    policies designed only to perpetuate himself and ruins the country in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, 2001-2003, what were your major
                        involvements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I've talked about the conflict dimension. That took a lot of effort
                    and time. That was mainly working with the Economic Bureau and this weird
                    amalgam of other departments and agencies - Customs, Treasury, U.S. Trade
                    Representative. That was a world that I haven't done a whole lot with, the
                    economic world. That was interesting.</p>
                <p>Africa has 47 posts. They closed one recently. I spent a lot of time taking
                    ambassadors through the confirmation process, working closely with the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Legislation... There was the Zimbabwe Democracy Act and the Sudan Peace Act, the
                    Zimbabwe one being pushed by Senator Frist, who was concerned about Zimbabwe. He
                    is a senator from Tennessee and now majority leader in the Senate. He was then
                    the ranking member - this was during the brief democratic control of the Senate
                    - of the African Affairs Subcommittee of Senate Foreign Relations. Several
                    members of the House African Affairs Subcommittee cared about Zimbabwe... Sudan,
                    the one African issue that really has a domestic constituency because a lot of
                    American religious organizations have been running missions for many years in
                    southern Sudan, particularly Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son. They have
                    built up a constituency amongst Republicans for action in the Sudan. They
                    heavily support the southerners and see the southerners as oppressed by the
                    Muslim north, which is true. That put a constituency in both the House and the
                    Senate. Frank Wolf and some others were very interested in that issue. Plus some
                    Democrats who had always paid attention to Africa like Russ Feingold from
                    Wisconsin, who was chairman of the Subcommittee and now ranking minority member
                    on the Senate side. Don Payne of New Jersey. Some of the Black Caucus
                    members.</p>
                <p>But there are very few members of Congress who pay attention to Africa, know
                    where it is, know what's going on, and care. You're always looking to build that
                    pool. We encourage every CODEL. Some parts of the world consider CODELs a curse.
                    In Africa, we consider them a blessing. We need to educate as many members of
                    Congress as we possibly can about Africa and U.S. policy there and why it's
                    important. So, one of the great disappointments was the Congressional Black
                    Caucus, which in the days of apartheid was very active on African affairs. I
                    have never succeeded in getting them very engaged. Don Payne was the ranking
                    member of the Subcommittee. He would pay attention. But hardly anyone else from
                    the congressional Black Caucus. It was always surprising to discover how little
                    they knew about what was going on in Africa or cared. Like most members of
                    Congress, they have domestic concerns that are more pressing, particularly on
                    the House side. So that was frustrating. There wasn't much of a constituency and
                    I didn't get very far in building it. I was dealing with a few key members and
                    the staffs of the 2 African affairs committees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the staff both in the Senate
                        and the House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Generally very good. I started this working with the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee when Jesse Helms was the ranking minority members of the
                    committee. The Republican staff were his staffers. The Helms staff had
                    terrorized the Foreign Service for years. But by the time I got there, Helms was
                    mellowed somewhat and his staff was quite professional and they weren't, with a
                    few exceptions, the horrible ideologues of legend who would hold up ambassadors
                    for years at a time just because they didn't like something they'd done
                    domestically, or because the ambassador once said something nice about something
                    Helms didn't like. They were quite professional. I worked surprisingly well with
                    them. They weren't a real problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The democratic staff, some of the people I worked with were extremely
                    knowledgeable and like me shared the frustration that they couldn't get more
                    attention paid to what they thought were important African issues particularly
                    Senator Feingold and his staff. He has spent, by his choice, nine years on the
                    Africa Subcommittee, something most people avoid because they go to something
                    sexier, something that gets better press. He's chosen to stay there. He's
                    traveled extensively in Africa. His staff has traveled extensively. They know
                    what they're talking about. He goes out of his way in each confirmation hearing
                    to make sure he holds the hearing, make sure he has a list of thoughtful
                    questions that really probe and test the ambassador just to make sure he's done
                    his homework and knows what he's talking about, and he feels it's important to
                    do that. I agree with him. Confirmation hearings can be an empty ritual if
                    there's no controversy over the nominee. But Senator Feingold always made sure
                    that he had some serious questions, the hearing was serious, and the ambassador
                    candidate was probed.</p>

                <p>MCILVAINE: I also did South Asia for about 9 months. That was quite different.
                    There, there is a constituency and there is a lobby, the Indian lobby, usually
                    trying to bash Pakistan any way they can. There is a fair bit of interest on the
                    Hill because there are large Indian communities in many congressional districts
                    and they make their influence felt. They contribute and they write their
                    congressmen. So, that was quite different. In terms of confirmation, I had the
                    new Bush Assistant Secretary for South Asia, who was a Hill staffer. She had
                    been a staffer for Senator Brownback from Kansas. Very nice. Christina Rocca.
                    There was so much more interest than there were on my African issues and so much
                    more of a rambunctious, not always well informed, but a lot more members paying
                    attention, particularly misinformed because there were some active lobbyists and
                    the lobbyists weren't always telling the whole story. And of course, Afghanistan
                    was headline stuff.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the attack on the World Trade Center in September 2001 affect- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Suddenly I was doing almost exclusively Afghanistan at a much higher
                    level. Instead of me and the Assistant Secretary and a few office directors
                    doing briefings, I was organizing briefings for the Deputy Secretary and the
                    biggest shots in the Department in the classified briefing room in the Capitol.
                    That was a good deal higher profile than I had been dealing with before. This
                    time, instead of staff, I was getting all the senators and lots of them. This
                    was hot stuff and there was a lot of interest. So, in a crisis like that, one of
                    the challenges is, the Foreign Service tends to think, “Let us manage the
                    crisis.” The Embassy always thinks, “Let us manage the crisis. We know what to
                    do here” and has to keep Washington at bay. Washington, the Department, has to
                    keep Congress at bay or managed.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>If it is headline stuff, Congress, particularly the foreign relations committees,
                    want to know what's going on. They want to be briefed because they want to be
                    able to answer constituencies and press conferences and go on “Meet the Press”
                    on Sunday and so forth and talk intelligently about it. So, you have all this
                    time when you should be working on the crisis where you're pulled away to brief,
                    constantly keep the Hill informed. One of the challenges right up to the highest
                    level is how to manage that so that they feel they're being kept briefed but you
                    aren't spending all your time briefing them individually. So, you organize
                    specific briefings. The Bush administration is quite good about this with Iraq
                    where they have a ritual. Wednesday afternoon at 4:00, Rumsfeld and Powell will
                    be here. Show up and don't complain if you miss it. This is your chance. They
                    had a thing like that that was fixed into the schedule where they would commit a
                    couple of hours to go talk to the senior senators and the members of the House
                    who needed to be briefed. Congress is always jealous of that, always afraid
                    they're going to be shut out of the policymaking process, with some reason -
                    frequently, they are. They are eager to keep informed because they want to sound
                    informed to their constituents and to the press. If you're in the Congressional
                    Relations office, it's very important that you manage that successfully so that
                    the guys you need will be there when you need them and your relationship with
                    the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is very important.
                    Sometimes you have to ask him for favors, like, “Don't hold that hearing just
                    now” or “Can we move this bill this week?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were with Congressional Relations dealing after
                        the 9/11 business, did you find that the Pentagon, the Department of
                        Defense, was selling a somewhat different line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: There is always an element of competition between Defense and State
                    because you have different approaches and you're frequently in the same arena,
                    and particularly where you get to something where U.S. troops are being
                    committed. But basically on that note, I think State and Defense worked very
                    well together. I wasn't directly involved in this, in vivid contrast to the Iraq
                    thing, where there has obviously been considerable bureaucratic trench warfare.
                    But on Afghanistan, I didn't see any serious friction. It may have come later on
                    in the post-war phase where Defense reluctance to commit to the stabilization
                    force, peacekeeping force, and all that, I think has probably damaged and
                    delayed the establishment of an Afghani government that can survive on its own.
                    This ideological reluctance or horror at so-called nation building has gotten us
                    into a lot of trouble. Things that we should have been done with more gusto,
                    enthusiasm, and resources, and commitment from the start.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it apparent right after this terrorist attack that certainly on the part
                    of the civilian head of the Department of Defense they were gearing up and
                    looking for reason to go into Iraq? Did State and you get involved in this?</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: No, not at my level. I had had lots of dealings with DOD when I was
                    working West African affairs because of the need for military training, for
                    support, for the West Africans for peacekeepers, all that. I had worked very
                    closely with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and knew those guys quite
                    well during that period. Then, when I moved to Congressional Relations, I had
                    very little to do with DOD from there because they have the Arms Services
                    Committees that they work with and I don't mess with those. I have the Foreign
                    Relations Committees and they don't mess with those. I would work with the DOD
                    congressional liaison, talk to them periodically, and we would say, “Okay,
                    that's your turf. I'll stay out of your way. Tell me if you need anything.” And
                    they'd do the same with me. It was very useful for both of us to keep that
                    division. It may have seemed a bit artificial but you're in that job of
                    congressional affairs representing a department and an administration. Your most
                    valuable currency is your relationship at my level, with the staffers; at my
                    boss' level his relationship with the key senators and members, because
                    frequently you're asking for favors, you need something to be moved, you need
                    something to be delayed for whatever political reason, you need something to
                    happen now or to not happen now, and they can do that. That means frequently
                    they need favors and you have to help them. They need information, a briefing,
                    to be able to talk to their constituents about something. They need their letter
                    answered. You have to be able to deliver that, too. It's a give and take but
                    that give and take is critical to your success in that job. If you can call
                    those guys up in the middle of the night and ask for a favor and they'll
                    respond, you're doing well. If you can't...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a professional Foreign Service officer and dealing with
                        foreign affairs, did you experience among yourself or with your colleagues
                        any disquiet over the thrust of the Bush administration's foreign policy
                        before and after 9/11 towards relations with Europe and elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: A little. The liberal democratic side was always frustrated, that
                    cared about Africa. And here I'm talking about Biden's staff and Feingold's
                    staff. They were politely frustrated that the administration wouldn't spend more
                    time. They were very good about not complaining heavily about it. They
                    understood that the bureau was working hard on Africa but that the
                    administration would not be spending more time on and committing more resources
                    to some of the problems they were very aware of. But that's normal. It probably
                    went the other way in the previous Administration where the Republicans claimed
                    that we were spending too much time on Africa. “Why is Clinton going to Africa
                    again?” That's normal.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I don't deserve any credit but the working relationship on the Senate Africa
                    Subcommittee between Feingold and Frist kept the partisan peace and we didn't
                    get into any serious partisan wrangling. They got along with each other. They
                    agreed that Africa was important. Early on, there was a Malian president who had
                    a West African initiative to ban individual weapons, the AK-47, easily available
                    throughout Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Helms' staff decided this was gun
                    control and somehow connected this to their domestic horror of gun control.
                    Every now and then, you run into these weird ideological stumbling blocks with
                    members of Congress that you just didn't anticipate and you have to grapple your
                    way through those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of this, you mentioned earlier about the AIDS
                        epidemic. What about with Africa and AIDS? Did that involve you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: Oh, yes. It was devastating. We first became aware of it in the Congo
                    in '83/'84. At the embassy there, we had a guy named Jonathan Mann. He was doing
                    the first serious AIDS research at Mama Yemo Hospital. I got to know him. His
                    wife then was French and she worked with me as a translator. She was our local
                    hire translator for documents and things like that. Very nice lady. Mann later
                    became the UN World AIDS guy and then even later died in that Swissair plane
                    crash in Nova Scotia.</p>
                <p>We became aware of this horrible disease. People were dying. It was just
                    beginning to appear on the national scene back home. We went to Tanzania and it
                    was not noticeable in Dar es Salaam and amongst the people I worked with. But I
                    was hearing about it upcountry particularly around the southern shores of Lake
                    Victoria. This belt here from southern Uganda to northern Tanzania was just
                    devastated by AIDS, village after village after village.</p>
                <p>So I flew up to Bukoba, the Tanzanian town on Lake Victoria, just to find out
                    what was going on. I went to the hospital there and came back horrified. It was
                    a war zone. Right out of town there were villages... One had 223 orphans.
                    Basically, people were telling me - these were Catholic priests and the medical
                    workers at the hospital - that in village after village there were no mature
                    adults. It was kids and the old folks. Everybody in between was dead. The old
                    folks were struggling somehow to manage the kids and to feed them. I had a long
                    talk with the folks at the hospital in Mwanza, where they were struggling to get
                    surgical gloves because their health professionals were starting to die off. It
                    was clear something serious was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>My next assignment was Zambia and there it was in plain sight. People I worked
                    with at the foreign ministry just withered and died, disappeared. No one would
                    say what had happened to them. “Where did So and So go?” “Oh, well, he died last
                    week.” “What happened?” “Oh, something.” It was clear what it was. About five
                    days before Christmas, we had been there three months, and the cook's teenage
                    son knocks on the door about 4:00 AM and says, “Mama is very sick and we need
                    your help.” So I go with him to the servants' quarters and she is extremely
                    sick. I carry her to my Land Rover, put her in the back seat of the Land Rover,
                    and drive him and her to the hospital. Two days later, she's dead. It's AIDS. We
                    had just gotten to know her. The kids were playing with her children. All the
                    rest. So it got right home very quickly. Then every day the procession of
                    funerals going out to this graveyard that was on the way to the school... It was
                    devastating. It was wrecking Zambia. And then you hear the stories later about
                    Botswana, where it's even worse. One of every four adult males is infected. It's
                    appalling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during the time you were with Congressional
                        Relations? Was AIDS a dominant theme?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: It was a big theme and I didn't work with it. It was done mainly by
                    the people doing the Office of Environment and Science, OES. There was big AIDS
                    legislation but I didn't do it.</p>
                <p>Q: Is there any other thing we should talk about about this last phase?</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: One other thing on AIDS that was particularly interesting and this
                    particularly came through while I was in Zambia. That was the extent to which
                    culture contributed to it. AIDS in Africa, or at least in the parts of Africa
                    that I was dealing with, southern and eastern Africa, was transmitted mostly
                    through heterosexual contact. That worked for several reasons. One, the poor
                    medical system. There was a lot of venereal disease which meant that there were
                    open sores in the vagina. It meant that if one or other of the partners was HIV
                    positive, it was much easier to transmit the disease than it is in the West,
                    where healthcare is reasonably good and you don't have open sores, you don't
                    have the easy transmission. Secondly, the healthcare system was in very bad
                    shape. Government after government had not put its resources into that.
                    Healthcare was very limited. Thirdly, and the one that was surprising, was how
                    much the culture contributed to it. The view that the urban male could be a
                    predator and that was just fine. My wife likes to say that the most dangerous
                    thing a woman could do in Zambia was get married because you could count on your
                    husband running around, becoming HIV positive, and then infecting you. You could
                    just about count on it. There were all these stories about how the woman was
                    supposed to pack their husbands bag for a trip - not a very liberated society -
                    and put in the condoms so that when he was playing around on the trip. It was
                    just assumed that if you were a successful male, which usually meant a senior
                    government official, you could prey on any comely young thing in the ministry
                    you came across. It seemed to be generally accepted. That contributed enormously
                    to the easy transmission and the movement of the disease and the devastating
                    impact it had on usually the most educated, the most privileged section of
                    society. It was a bad news story all the way around. There was no good news
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this do to you and your family and other American
                        families? If the cook dies of AIDS, this is not good news.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCILVAINE: As DCM, part of my responsibility was the morale and the protection of
                    the mission. We did spend some time keeping the mission educated on the disease
                    and the situation and how it could be transmitted. Basically, although it was
                    all around us, we were well insulated from it. The Zambians around us were not.
                    Hardly anybody could escape noticing that. We didn't have any AIDS within the
                    American community. We didn't have any cases of it. We had to consciously
                    reassure our people that if normal practices were maintained, you could prevent
                    transmission from servants or anybody working on your house or anything like
                    that. So we didn't have any panic. But it was always there, the cloud in the
                    background. For some families, it came right into the foreground when somebody
                    you knew or worked with or admired or respected withered up and died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Peace Corps? These are young, mostly single
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>MCILVAINE: I think Peace Corps was very careful to scare them to death in the
                    training process. We never had any problem that I was aware of. We had a large
                    Peace Corps presence in Zambia. But that's not to say it didn't happen. It must
