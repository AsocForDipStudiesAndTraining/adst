                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 26, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little background about yourself,
                        where you came from, your education, and where you grew up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was born and raised in the central valley of California, in a farming
                    community. My undergraduate work was in biology at the University of California,
                    Berkeley, worked briefly for a bank, went into the army with every body else,
                    got out in 1945, went to Stanford for graduate studies in political science to
                    study under Graham Stuart about the foreign service and the practice of
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Stuart was the only person to write about diplomacy
                        in practical terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I think you're almost right, although Father Walsh also taught in those
                    terms. I took the foreign service exams and entered the service in August of
                    1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you to the foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Two things, one idealistic, the other pragmatic. Having been a soldier
                    in Europe during the war it seemed clear to me that there was still a lot to be
                    done. The bloodshed had stopped but that was only the beginning. I also needed a
                    job and looked at what talents I had that might find me one. I had languages and
                    an interest in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with a class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Yes, we did have classes back then. We were about 25. There was George
                    Est, Harry Symmes, Bill Stedman, Hector Prudhomme, a distinguished man who came
                    from Wall Street, Clint Olson, and one woman, Anne Ohm. We had no ethnic
                    minority members.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was to Vienna. It must have been a
                        fascinating time to be there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: It was romantic, right out of a Strauss operetta. Then again, “The Third
                    Man” was not just a movie to us either.</p>
                <p>The city was in terrible state, the two winters after the war were cruel, the
                    economy was in a desperate state, the Russians occupied the half of the country
                    and were beginning to be very disagreeable about it.</p>
                <p>The work atmosphere was wonderful, especially for me, the most junior officer. We
                    still had a staff small enough that we could participate in everything. We could
                    go to the opera for 35 cents, and there was a PX for the necessities. Our two
                    children were both born in Vienna. Those were effervescent years for us.
                    Minister Jack Erhardt was the Chief of Mission. He was particularly concerned in
                    developing young officers. He and Mrs. Erhardt were disciplinarians, and had
                    codes of behavior that were to be observed, but they were gentle, happy
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the legation view the Soviets at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Interesting point. We really crossed the line. I came into the Service
                    with the dream that, with the end of the war we could build a peaceful new
                    world. However, while we were in Vienna, the Soviets began to destroy the free
                    governments of Eastern Europe. One of my assignments concerned care for those
                    who crawled under the barbed wire at night. and to get then into shelter. My
                    view of the situation changed so much.</p>
                <p>I'm still embarrassed by the following story but three years after I went home, a
                    service club of my hometown asked me to speak at a dinner. I spoke of the
                    immense Soviet forces in Eastern Europe and what they had done to free
                    institutions there. I guess I overdid it because our hometown newspaper came out
                    the next day with the big black letters APPLING PREDICTS WAR. I was not
                    particularly worried about the Oakdale Leader getting to the State Department,
                    but....(laughter).</p>
                <p>The world view changed as we entered the Cold War period. The obstinacy of the
                    Soviets destroyed the dreams of others and we were face to face with them during
                    that change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move on to the latter part of your career. You
                        were in London, were you not in 1951-53.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was there as part of the staff of the U.S. representative to NATO and
                    after one year the whole organization moved to Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for the formation of NATO then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Yes we were building the organization. Fascinating exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was a political officer and the reporting officer for the meetings of
                    the representatives to NATO. I also did a lot of political-military work. I was
                    negotiator for the Status of Forces Agreement, which with the Parallel Agreement
                    in Japan, was the prototype of such agreements. A great experience for a young
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the officers around you view West Germany? Was
                        there some suspicion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Again, I think it was a transition period. When we got to London there
                    was still the idea of a quarantined Germany, certainly though not the Morgenthau
                    plan of destroying Germany industry. But wiser heads already saw the strength of
                    Germany and felt it would be wise to include it in the larger European family. I
                    think particularly of Livy Merchant, one of the heroes of my life. He saw
                    clearly that a close relationship with Western Europe and Germany included in
                    that family was really the only way to expect a stable peace. This was not in
                    order to sustain an aggressive position against the Soviet Union. It was to keep
                    Germany from exclusion and let it restore itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem adjusting to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: No I didn't. I had been to Germany several times since the war and saw
                    the beginnings of reconstruction. I could see that this was not a nation to
                    suppress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was France viewed at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: To be quite frank, I almost feel that I have never served in France. We
                    were in Paris but I had little contact with French political circles, nor was I
                    working day to day with French policy except in the NATO framework where they
                    were esteemed partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about France within NATO? Was it a full member?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>APPLING: They were then full members and leaders of NATO. The French gave to us
                    some of their most distinguished public servants. They had a strong delegation
                    and were significant in shaping the organization. Perhaps in the back of some
                    minds was the idea of French predominance as the strongest European nation but
                    this was not their posture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviet threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: In 1950 the reality of the Soviet threat was clear. The concept of NATO
                    goes back long before that. Many in the Foreign Service, such as Ted Achilles,
                    had a vision of a European/American Community. This was given a powerful thrust
                    by the Korean War and by the Soviet recalcitrance in Eastern Europe. The
                    military/defense aspects of NATO were there when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then back in Vienna in 1953-54?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Not in Vienna but on the Austrian Desk, when the shape of the ultimate
                    State Treaty was being designed. A very interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think the Soviets were willing to give up some
                        territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: That's one of the great debates since. Why did they do it?</p>
                <p>I think they thought Austria was not worth the candle. We were not going to let
                    them take over the country. Some say it was a gesture preliminary to the
                    negotiations on the German question. It might have seemed a nice thing to do.
                    But I don't think it was niceness. I think Austria had become a kind of
                    inconvenience to them and unimportant to their security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you on the Austrian desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: The files were replete with economic studies which concluded that free
                    Austria would not be economically viable. We laugh now, when we see how well it
                    has done. The Austrian television once interviewed me for a history of the State
                    Treaty, and they seemed to have the preconclusion that we wanted Austria free so
                    that we could manipulate it into an anti-Soviet position. My recollection is
                    that this is entirely false. The concern most in our minds was whether Austria
                    would be able to preserve its neutrality? Would their economy be strong enough
                    to maintain independence in their geographic location midst countries occupied
                    by the Soviets and with a strong Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the secretariat for some years then. What
                        did you do there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: In those days when you were with the secretariat, you did everything. It
                    was a very fluid organization and they had cadre of people that they moved all
                    around. We used to work six weeks for a group of bureaus, usually one geographic
                    and two functional, channeling all of their papers up to the secretary, and then
                    back down. We would be asked to prepare this or that meeting or to work on a
                    particular problem. One I followed for example, was Chinese pressure on Quemoy
                    and Matsu. Another role was as the Secretariat person for the small circle of
                    Dulles' advisers, Merchant, MacArthur, Bowie, Phleger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you think this group worked for Dulles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: It was the way he worked. He did not choose to use much the wider
                    circles or the Department, but those advisers knew how to be effective links. I
                    would not recommend this isolated sort of operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then assigned to Bonn as a political officer from
                        1956 to 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: In fact I was assigned to somewhere in Africa, I can't remember where
                    but I ran into someone in the hall who thought I could be useful in Bonn, in
                    view of my past experience, I was sent there instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I had the best assignment in the Embassy, in a separate office which
                    dealt with German internal politics. It was near the Parliament building. Our
                    work was entirely with the German political machinery in a fascinating time. The
                    new German state and its political structure were still in formation. It was
                    interesting to work with those people and see how the parties were becoming part
                    of the whole structure and how power is created.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were like viceroys for a long time. Was it difficult to
                        relinquish power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Our concern was that the German government be strong and effective. We
                    had no desire to hold it back. We wanted all of the German leadership to work
                    with us in international affairs, especially in the European Community and in
                    relations with the U.S.S.R. Berlin was of course an important part of the
                    political picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to Berlin a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Occasionally. The staff there handled Berlin but we communicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other consulates? Could you report fairly
                        accurately because the consulates were communicating to the center in
                        Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: The consulates did what they were supposed to do and reported
                    competently on regional political and their perspective on national affairs. We
                    would consult with the political officers in the Consulates regularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular problems in international relations at that
                        time you can recall. You served under two distinguished ambassadors, Dr.
                        Conant, former president of Harvard, and David Bruce our diplomat par
                        excellence under several of our administrations. Could you talk about their
                        operating styles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Dr. Conant was not there long after I arrived, less than a year. Both
                    very comfortable men, easy to talk to even for junior officers. Rather different
                    approaches. Conant more scholarly, Bruce more political. Both men of great
                    intelligence. Aristocrats, genteel, sharp and disciplined minds, devoted public
                    servants.</p>
                <p>Bruce had an unusual ability to anticipate what was going to happen and how
                    people were going to react to it and masterful knowledge and intuition about
                    Washington. Leaders must have a vision and Ambassador Bruce saw clearly what
                    sort of Europe and what sort of world we needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then spent three years as a staff assistant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Merchant was under secretary for political affairs and asked me to work
                    for him. With the change in administration, there was a moment there when we
                    might have established the position of under secretary as a career position but
                    political pressures were too great. The political consequences of that were
                    great as well. We might, for example, have better managed the Bay of Pigs affair
                    if there had been continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had another interview with someone who had the same
                        opinion about the Bay of Pigs affair. I guess the Kennedy Administration was
                        going through a learning period, as all administrations do, and they didn't
                        quite have it all together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>What about the style of operation of Livingston Merchant.</p>
                <p>APPLING: Two things. His utter selflessness. He had no personal ambition. He had
                    been successful in other walks of life and came to Washington as a public
                    servant.</p>
                <p>The other was his stock of good humor. Even under pressure and long hours, he
                    could always brighten the situation for everybody. He once said to me that the
                    one who succeeds in diplomacy is the one who can keep his wits about him, keep
                    his emotions under control longest. You'll be most effective if you don't get
                    rattled. He was an example of this. He had a great capacity for indignation. If
                    someone did something malicious or stupid he would be quick to say so. A great
                    respecter of other people's opinions. Open to listening and responding.
                    Commanded respect. People who worked with him knew he was a good man. One of the
                    early ones to have the vision of a united Europe. Indochina was becoming
                    important when I went to work for him and he was very active in State/Defense
                    collaboration and conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Kennedy Administration takeover a hostile one,
                        like the Reagan Administration takeover from the Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: The Kennedy Administration was looking ahead, not back. They were
                    looking for people who could imprint the Kennedy style, philosophy and thinking
                    into the Department. I worked for Roger Jones who fought for professional
                    excellence in American public service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still very much a Europeanist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Yes.</p>
                <p>Though even in those days I was preaching about generalists. I suppose I was the
                    last of the generalists. I still believe that you can't represent the United
                    States well if your interest and experience is solely in one geographic
                    area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1963-65 what were your main concerns in the office of
                        West European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: One thing was the end of the empires, such things as the Congo, Portugal
                    relinquishing its colonies in Africa. De Gaulle and the re-shaping of France in
                    Europe was important. Italy was unstable economically and politically. There was
                    talk of Italy's “window to the east”, and leftist factions into the government.
                    Bases in Spain were on the agenda.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made a tremendous jump when you went as DCM to
                        Damascus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was worried about getting too deeply involved in Europe and about
                    being stereotyped as a management person. Damascus was approved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in 1965 in Syria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Stagnant to some extent. They were locked into the aggressive hostility
                    to Israel and to American policy in support of Israel's independence. The
                    Baathists had taken power and were insecure. They saw enemies on every side and
                    they were not open to searching for areas of cooperation. We were still putting
                    some assistance into Syria at the time. The Soviets were moving in and gaining
                    influence. They had the ear of the Syrian government more than we and were
                    providing military supplies.</p>
                <p>It was my first experience working with a government which was suspicious and
                    antagonistic at every turn. It was impossible to conduct any conversation
                    without our being scolded for our position on Israel.</p>
                <p>It was also something of a police state. We were kept under surveillance and
                    couldn't invite guests to our house without them being screened by their secret
                    police. If we gave a reception, two photographers would show up and take
                    pictures of everybody.</p>
                <p>Having said that, there were a number of Syrian government officials and a large
                    number of Syrian people whose views I respected and we were good friends.I
                    remember being somewhat shaken by my first staff meeting when I was charg�. I
                    asked what do you think we're doing here? Nobody answered. It was a shock.</p>
                <p>We took what opportunities there were to enter into dialogue with the Syrians. I
                    did not then perceive what I think I see now, Syria's interest in area hegemony.
                    I didn't realize they wanted to exert regional power. There were unending
                    disputes and reconciliations with Iraq and sometimes with Egypt. We went through
                    assorted coups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How seriously did we view the Soviet threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: On the scale of one to ten, if ten means that they were about to invade
                    and one means we had no fear, I would put it at 3 or 4. We watched with concern
                    but, I think the Soviets didn't want a major confrontation with us there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any fear of a communist takeover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>APPLING: No, we relied on the fact that the Syrians didn't want that. It was a
                    Moslem state and was fairly anti-communist. They're Arab nationalists and they
                    didn't want to be taken over by anyone. There are many who feel that the Arab
                    states are more impervious to home grown communism than are others.</p>
                <p>There were some communists in town. There was an incident which arose from a
                    squabble at the international school. A communist lawyer got into it and we were
                    concerned that he would exploit and aggravate our difficult relations. However,
                    Syrian anti-Americanism worried us more than their pro-Sovietism.</p>
                <p>There were occasions when I could go, as privately as possible, to Syrian
                    officials to point out that slanderous anti-American stuff in the press every
                    day was getting out of hand and to suggest that it would be useful to have a
                    word with the editors. Sometimes it would be toned down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One more question about Damascus. How did you find the
                        atmosphere regarding Israel within the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: There is a myth that the State Department is pro-Arab. I found all of
                    the staff in Damascus to be objective. We reported honestly and tried to find
                    ways to improve relations but there was no anti-Israel bias.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a new ambassador who was not career. A poor place
                        for a non professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: He had never been in government before. I assumed he was appointed
                    because there was a political debt to him. He did not like me and we parted
                    company very quickly. My judgment of his role is rather harsh and I should not
                    express it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then a pol/mil officer in Manila, with Ambassador
                        Williams. What were your major concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Basically, it was to maintain the acceptability of the bases with the
                    populace and the government. It was not hard because Marcos was in absolute
                    control at the time and he was our ally and dependent on us. There was always
                    talk of eliminating the bases but I saw this as trying to get the bases on
                    better terms. Among the tasks I performed was the negotiation of the base labor
                    agreement—the terms under which Philippine nationals were employed by the bases
                    and their relationship with the labor unions, very interesting exercise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work out with the American military. They
                        seem to be oblivious to local problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: It is true of some military personnel particularly those who have only
                    worked on bases at home which they ruled with military authority. However, when
                    I was in Manila, the Defense Department was sensitive politically, and put
                    people in charge who were aware of political reality. They collaborated with the
                    pol/mil officer in the Embassy and I worked closely and easily with the base
                    commanders and their staffs. But there were all kinds of problems. A sentry shot
                    a bicycle thief and the hot question was about jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Eventually the Philippines agreed to giving the military commander
                    jurisdiction. They were willing to concede the point as long as the offender
                    left the Philippines at once. It was very touchy. In general, commanders worked
                    very hard with the local authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Marcos at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I don't think the embassy had any illusions about Marcos' power and his
                    abuse of it. But at that time we were willing to accept a large measure of it.
                    He was a duly elected president of the country and these were internal matters
                    to a large extent. He was supportive of us in almost every way in the country
                    and in the region. He was useful when the conflict in Vietnam was growing bigger
                    and bigger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get assigned to Tay Ninh in Vietnam in 1969,
                        as a province advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: They needed people and it was difficult to get senior officers to go.
                    There was a time when the Far Eastern Bureau was able to commandeer officers and
                    I was ordered to go. One day I was going as DCM to New Zealand, and the next day
                    that was canceled and I was going to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>APPLING: I'm glad you asked that question. Those jobs were very little understood
                    and most unusual. We were sort of petty viceroys, pro-consuls of a province,
                    advisors, with a great deal of weight, to the province chief who had command of
                    the local militia and authority over all of the civil side of the government,
                    over the refugees, hospitals, agriculture, education, transportation and other
                    economic areas. I had a diverse and numerous staff and we had authority and
                    responsibility in our little world but our purpose was to strengthen the
                    Vietnamese Community.</p>
                <p>Tay Ninh is about 35 miles northeast of Saigon on the Cambodian border. The Cao
                    Dai religion is predominant there and its cathedral is in that province. They
                    had a social and political structure parallel to the government. I became a very
                    good friend with their religious hierarchy. They had a tight community and took
                    good care of their people. Their roots reached far back into nationalist
                    opposition to French rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most Americans don't have any background for this. How did
                        you go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: With great difficulty. I believed that the Vietnamese understood the
                    situation better than I or better than my staff. My first effort was to hear
                    from them. To get as far down into the society as I could, to see what this
                    guerrilla warfare was all about. The community seemed to be fine during the day
                    and then at night there would be Viet Cong in the streets and propaganda
                    lessons, troops terrorizing the farmers for food to feed their guerrilla.We had
                    the border zones, where the Viet Cong took troops through, constant military
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the local government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: There were two province chiefs while I was there, one was a scholarly
                    type, timid perhaps, not wanting to be blamed for anything. He was carried by
                    his subordinates. He went back to Saigon pretty quickly.</p>
                <p>The second, became a good friend and I respected him as governor and military
                    commander. He had been raised in a tradition of nationalism and wanted very much
                    to establish a stable society and effective government. He was a military man
                    respected by the regular army and the U.S. advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say something about the corruption. In some
                        Asian societies it seems the only way things got done.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>APPLING: The northern part of Tay Ninh province has extensive tropical forests,
                    very valuable wood. The people were allowed to harvest it if they had a permit.
                    I'm sure no one ever got a permit without kicking back some of the returns. The
                    province chief never would say anything about it but I understood that officials
                    in Saigon had a list of who cut timber and what happened to the wood taken out.
                    I doubt if any business was operated without somebody getting some money for
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese army would sometimes come in when the Viet Cong were especially
                    aggressive and the command would set up at the province chief's home and the
                    surrounding houses. They had no good lines of supply and someone had to feed
                    them. The province chief had no choice but to get the food from the farmers. He
                    acquired land himself, I assume at a low price, by putting the squeeze on
                    someone. Public positions were not obtained without influence. Even so, there
                    was much progress toward civil order and local government truly serving its
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The government of Thieu was exerting its authority through
                        the province chief. But you thought things were working out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: We had a good beginning. Using almost exclusively local militia, Tay
                    Ninh produced a degree of stability, opened up a very large area for agriculture
                    with new rice and new technology. We began to have local elections. People were
                    willing though frightened to enter into local government positions. I was
                    troubled that the people felt as little identity with the national government.
                    There was little popular responsiveness to them. Little people felt that the
                    Saigon government were just soldiers making the best of an opportunity for power
                    and wealth. I had hoped that given time, local democracy would grow up, and with
                    education and experience there would be greater confidence in the national
                    government. But it was weak while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the shock of the Tet Offensive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I came to Vietnam well after the Tet offensive. I think it had more
                    repercussions outside Vietnam, than inside. It was not a military success for
                    the Viet Cong and I didn't see any shock waves in Tay Ninh but I did not grasp
                    adequately its effect abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the communication with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was in the CORDS line of authority and the embassy was a fairly
                    distant thing to us. Political officers would come out from time to time but we
                    did not work very effectively together. The Ambassador gave me generous personal
                    attention and I thought we were well supported in our unusual role.</p>

                        than they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Not in the 1968-69 tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. I served as consul general in Saigon about
                        that time, and you're right. Things weren't so bad, in fact we were
                        winning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>From there, in the heat of the battle, you went to Canberra as DCM.</p>
                <p>APPLING: Like champagne out of the bottle. I had had a long experience by then
                    with governments that didn't work well, and it was good to land in a country
                    that was well organized and well disposed. You could raise a problem and get a
                    responsible answer. It might be negative but nevertheless it was productive. And
                    I was again with my family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Rice was your ambassador, was he not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: For me, as DCM, he was just fine. He took pride in his position and
                    wanted to do things that would be useful.</p>
                <p>He was a non professional ambassador who supported his staff and, from long
                    experience in business presented a face of the U.S. which is important in
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Being good partners who shared information of views fully, trade, access
                    to American markets. I remember one long and difficult problem about meat
                    inspection. The Australians saw our criticism as harassment and attempts to
                    limit their access to our market. We had to be very careful with our facts and
                    work with them to meet our standards. I had a skilled Australian opposite who
                    understood the situation and who brought in American inspectors to improve their
                    system for their own market as well.</p>
                <p>American investment was growing at an astounding rate and we tried to make sure
                    it was acceptable to the Australians. We wanted to make the conditions inviting
                    to American investors.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Certainly the Nixon/Kissinger China opening was a shock to them since it came
                    without any consultations. Sir Keith Waller was then Secretary for Foreign
                    Affairs. He had been ambassador to Washington was very pro American—so much so
                    that he could be one of our most useful critics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps there was a need for secrecy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I would like to think there were ways to cushion the impact but this is
                    Monday morning quarter backing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Australians view our commitment to Vietnam at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: As you know they had substantial of forces there as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have political problems as home like we did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Much less than we did. This played a role in my future life. I'd been
                    out of the States since 1965 and went from Vietnam to Australia and there saw a
                    far out fringe squawking about Vietnam. I thought the resistance in the United
                    States to policy was something like that. I really did not have a good
                    understanding of the American political picture. I kick myself for not having
                    insisted on being sent back to the U.S. before going again to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is very difficult for others to understand
                        how things impact when you are overseas. The Watergate business for instance
                        you miss these things without the daily television news coverage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I'll tell a Watergate anecdote. Sir Keith Waller had just recently
                    returned from his position as ambassador here to take the position at the
                    foreign office there. I was with him in his office when an aide came in with the
                    press bulletin about the Watergate break in. He showed it to me and I dismissed
                    it as trivial stupidity. He saw immediately the consequences this was going to
                    have in American politics. I didn't grasp the significance of what he was saying
                    until weeks later when events evolved further.</p>
                <p>This illustrates how out of touch one can get abroad and how a skilled foreign
                    diplomat may know us better than we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to Vietnam as DCM from 1973-74. Why did you
                        go back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>APPLING: Previously, for personal reasons, I had turned down a request that I go
                    somewhere, and I found that so contrary to my view of professional discipline
                    that when the telegram came, I just went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Ellsworth Bunker was about to leave and Graham Martin had not yet
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Martin before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I believe we were in Paris together and he was then administrative
                    officer. I knew him but not well. I saw him from time to time at the Department
                    when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he ask for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Well, he would have had his choice of DCM, certainly I guess he didn't
                    object.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Vietnam when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: We were just winding up the agreement on our withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Charlie Whitehouse was charg�. In the first days there was a series of messages
                    to iron out the last, most difficult passages with them, a lot of rushing out to
                    the palace at midnight and crash messages back to Washington.</p>
                <p>The agreements were then final and I was charg� for several weeks until Graham
                    came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude about these Kissinger agreements,
                        ours and the Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: The Vietnamese found them very dangerous. They repeatedly said they
                    would have to rely on our support, not our military aid, but our support.</p>
                <p>The embassy found the agreements acceptable. There was concern because there were
                    lots of weak points. We hoped it would work.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>APPLING: We felt that it was the best that we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Martin is a very controversial figure. Can you
                        describe his arrival on the scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Ambassador Martin's relationship with me could not have been more kindly
                    and gracious. He arrived at the airport and I met him and went to the office.
                    There he spoke of his reputation of a hard man and denied it. He sought my
                    opinions and I understood from him that the decisive things in Vietnam were not
                    there but in Washington.</p>
                <p>The next day he called me in and we talked at length again. I knew he was due at
                    the Foreign Ministry and I led him downstairs. There was no driver ready for us,
                    which I thought was strange but supposed it was just a mistake. We got to the
                    Foreign Ministry and no one was at the entrance to receive him. I ran in to talk
                    to the chief of protocol and discovered that I had the schedule wrong. The
                    appointment was for an hour later and I had mixed it up nervously trying to
                    please the new Ambassador. What a blunder, but the Ambassador treated it
                    lightly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate within the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Very quietly. He wanted to listen more than to speak. He was
                    disappointed that I didn't have a firm enough hand on what was going on but then
                    our embassy was so compartmentalized that it was not easy to manage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree, byzantine is the word I use. Various powers
                        involved, CIA, AID etc, and the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: And the DCM wasn't able to tell them what to do.You asked earlier about
                    twisted reporting. I don't think the Ambassador ever allowed that to occur, but
                    there were lots of fragmentary reports coming in and he was reluctant to pass on
                    an incomplete picture because of the political situation in the U.S. Where
                    everything leaked and could be abused. He didn't want one report to be
                    misconstrued as the entire picture, good or bad. Younger officers chafed at this
                    because they worked hard and reported accurately the fragments of the
                    picture.</p>
                <p>There was an endless train of visitors. I remember his meeting with Bella
                    Apzug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was from New York and very vocal about her opposition
                        to the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>APPLING: His conversation with her was amiable and penetrating. Both took very
                    opposite positions but the Ambassador was charming, full of information and not
                    provocative. I had expected fireworks but found a mutually respectful and
                    friendly conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he deal with the Vietnamese government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: A tinge of MacArthur. A little bit of the imperial. Listening to them
                    and responding to their concerns. The conversations were like “You need to do
                    this or you will lose support.” And he was able to make our concerns
                    understood.</p>
                <p>I can only really recall three or four conversations with Thieu and the foreign
                    minister. With the latter the subject was usually international support for
                    their position, how they might usefully engage with others. I have very few
                    recollections of Ambassador Martin meeting with other ambassadors. He had great
                    respect for the French ambassador who was our neighbor.</p>
                <p>We were both gone a lot. He was back in Washington twice for extended periods. I
                    was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and then went to Australia for
                    Christmas and left the following April.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the middle grade and more seniors
                        officers? There is the story that Ambassador Martin was completely out of
                        touch and so on during the last days of our embassy there. What was the
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I think in any large embassy the ambassador is rather distant from the
                    junior staff. He necessarily deals with the chiefs, but he talked and walked
                    around a lot. He might have been a little suspicious of the station chief,
                    because he thought he might know things he was not revealing.</p>
                <p>I guess because of my Tay Ninh experience, I seized opportunities to visit the
                    consulates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the peace accords, we had this system of consulate
                        generals established around. How did they work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: They worked fine. The Consuls General were in and out of Saigon
                    frequently, and were well informed about their areas. We didn't really funnel
                    information to them about what was going on at home.</p>

                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was much less sensitive to it than I should have been. I think Graham
                    had it constantly in his mind. He worried all the time about who had things in
                    hand when response was needed. I was not good in that role.</p>

                <p>APPLING: I don't think I really estimated correctly the ineffectiveness of the
                    governments of the U.S. and of Vietnam. We would bring up problems but neither
                    could do much about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: March of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the situation in South Vietnam at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Uneasy. My gut feeling was that it was not working well and yet I cared
                    about the country and was proud about how much good work had been done. I kept a
                    measure of confidence that they could make a go of it. I saw defeatism,
                    especially amongst my friends in the media. I don't think I made any sweeping
                    judgements because I didn't feel I had a total grasp of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back and your final assignment was as Deputy
                        Director General of the Foreign Service from 1974-76. Then you retired. What
                        did this job entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was also Director of Personnel and that was the predominant element.
                    The Director General took the major responsibility for the structure, the life,
                    the personality, the nature of the Foreign Service. He or she is also a major
                    advisor on principal appointments and the Deputy Director General assists as the
                    boss chooses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two Directors General. Nat Davis and Carol Laise.
                        How did Nat Davis operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>APPLING: Nat kept a very firm hand on what was going on and tended to use me to
                    keep track of the shop and keep him informed. There were certain problems that
                    didn't have to have his attention and I ran with those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of problems were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: If there was an employee in bad trouble, perhaps in danger of causing a
                    scandal, someone needed to talk discreetly with him. That's what I would do.
                    There was also constant conversation with the Bureaus about their personnel
                    needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Carol Laise use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Carol used her deputy as a staff aide to get things in shape for her to
                    act upon. She wanted ideas and wanted to reform the structure. I preferred to
                    fix the glitches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major problems you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Examples would be the case of young officers still on probation who
                    really had not had a chance to show their abilities or burned out officers who
                    needed a way out. That kind of individual problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words trying to keep the system from being so
                        impersonal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Cases where there was conflict between bosses and subordinates, where
                    careers, might be endangered and the work of the mission was being impaired.
                    That category is one side of what I did.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I spent too much time in this capacity. It may have been that I should
                    have given it to the staff. Perhaps I could have focused on the big picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the big picture is made up of individual cases such as
                        you are describing. Sometimes that is lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Experience working with different cases enables you to see clearly where
                    there are problems in the overall view.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>An example is the origin of the cone system.It was clear that people in the
                    administrative or consular track had ceilings imposed on them. People who had
                    broad ability and had served with skill and loyalty were topped out because the
                    system did not fill the top ranks from those sources. Something needed to be
                    done about this.</p>
                <p>We were beginning to cope with the problem of the large number of unassigned
                    senior officers. The selection out process was not cutting in soon enough to
                    allow people to have a second career opportunities. We were not dealing with
                    this properly.</p>
                <p>The budget and the size of the service were constant problems. Efforts to keep
                    the number of those entering the Service at a constant number—about 200—were
                    important. A steady inflow of talent is essential to the Service and it has to
                    be matched with outflow at the other end.</p>
                <p>The Director General was never able to do all that he wanted. He needed the
                    support of the government for maintaining a key position for the foreign service
                    in international relations. There were, by this time, so many powerful agencies
                    involved with foreign affairs, that the Foreign Service was having trouble
                    making itself effective. I liked the structure under Roger Jones, where the
                    under secretary for management had as his right hand the Director General of the
                    foreign service. By the time I returned to Washington, the Director General had
                    become much more detached from the seventh floor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Kissinger time, and how much attention did
                        he, and Larry Eagleburger, take with career development as opposed to
                        playing favorites?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Larry was much more concerned about professionalism than the secretary
                    naturally. But neither thought much about that. They had some strong views on
                    individuals whom they wanted or who they didn't like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the selection of ambassadors and the White House
                        impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Very much. The only really way to handle it was by seeing that the most
                    competent people were portrayed accurately. I played more of a staff role in
                    that. The intervention was the Director General's role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Ford administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: I was not very much involved. The under secretary for management was the
                    interface with Congress and the White House. In former days the Director would
                    have been more involved but by my time that responsibility had shifted
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the perpetual battle between the geographic and
                        speciality bureaus, and the centralized personnel system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Geographic bureaus are much more possessive than functional ones. The
                    Director General's office is constantly involved with career development and in
                    serving the broader needs of the service.</p>
                <p>My approach was to be on the closest personal basis with the assistant
                    secretaries and the executive directors of both kinds of bureaus. We had common
                    purposes and conflict was not inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were facing a new problem, several, minorities, more
                        women in the service, and what to do about the wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: We didn't deal with the spouse issue very well. We hadn't come to grips
                    with it. We knew it was an economic punishment to come into the service. We
                    initiated some employment abroad for the wives and found suitable assignments
                    for tandems. I worried about it but at that time we didn't have too many cases
                    like that.</p>
                <p>We were reaping the bitter fruits of the first efforts to increase the intake of
                    minorities. We tried very hard to get black persons. We waived exams, we
                    encouraged people to enter without then giving them enough support. And we were
                    getting the first failures. Within three and five years, they were coming out of
                    probation on the wrong side. This made it look like we were against the
                    minorities. But I don't know any subject that we spent more time engaged in,
                    than with the recruiting and training of young minority officers and assuring
                    equal opportunities for women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember being a senior officer myself dealing with this
                        problem. When you have a highly competitive system and you bring in one set
                        in that meet a certain of standards and then you bring in another set who
                        are brought in for perfectly honorable reasons and all, but for which you
                        waive the competition and then you put both groups in competition with each
                        other, with no program to help out, if this is possible, you're going to
                        have a division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: It was all done by score, quantity. I took much more pride in the
                    successes, in quantity. Those who prospered and became excellent officers. There
                    were not as many as we would have liked but we got caught up in the numbers
                    game.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tally Palmer. Could you explain that case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Tally Palmer was a talented young woman officer who was very interested
                    in women's rights and discrimination. She also became a priest in the episcopal
                    church, one of the first to break the barriers there.</p>
                <p>She was in east Africa and had been assigned as labor attach� I think. She was
                    removed from that position under the shadow of some kind of statement that a
                    woman can't be effective in that role. It was a case of bad judgement or
                    discrimination. She sued the State Department. I spoke to her on a number of
                    occasions and shared her interest in having more women join the service and in
                    their being treated fairly.</p>
                <p>Lawyers kept coming to see me in that job because there were a number of suits in
                    which I was named just because of my position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What gave you the greatest satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: My greatest satisfaction has come in the last year where we see some
                    fulfillment of the dreams we had in the early post war period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean when eastern Europe has changed remarkably?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>APPLING: Where the inherent problems of communism made it necessary to end the
                    hostility and to move ahead toward a better world.</p>
                <p>I take great satisfaction about the reporting that came out of Germany in those
                    early years. I think we did a good job in absorbing the growth of the new German
                    state and society. We influenced it to some extent and we understood it very
                    well. I think the organization of NATO was an innovation in foreign affairs. It
                    was a rewarding task to create an effective organization. It was unique and we
                    had no blue prints. I like to think that I had an effect in management in the
                    department. I was able to see progress and justice done. I've enjoyed the
                    personal relationships with outstanding public servants.</p>
