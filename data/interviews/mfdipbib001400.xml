                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 18, 2003</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 18, 2003. This is an interview with Charles
                        Marthinsen. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could you tell me when
                        and where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on May 18, 1931, one of 4
                    children. One of my brothers is deceased; I have a remaining brother and a
                    sister. When I was 7, we moved due to my father's work to Erie, Pennsylvania,
                    where I attended public grade school, junior high and high school. I received a
                    scholarship to Gannon University, then Gannon College, in Erie, where I got my
                    BA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a bit. Can you tell me something about your
                        father and his line of the family? Where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I've always described our family as typically American. My heritage
                    on my father's side is Norwegian and Swedish and on my mother's side Irish and
                    English. My maternal line can be traced back to the 1600s, to Barnstable County,
                    Massachusetts. Contrasting with that is the fact that my father was born in
                    Norway and emigrated as a child - he was 7 or to New Jersey where his father,
                    who had moved to the United States earlier, decided to settle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any feel about the Norwegian roots of your
                        family, where they came from and why they got out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, we just joked about it as a family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do? Where was he educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: He was in insurance. He didn't go to college. He worked in New York
                    City as an underwriter. My older brother went into the same business and several
                    of my uncles were also in insurance. This was a major reason why I decided I
                    didn't want to enter that field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother's side of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Mother's is the Irish-English heritage. I knew better my maternal
                    grandmother as a child. We lived fairly close to one another in Jersey City.
                    When we moved to Pennsylvania, it meant a trip “out west” for my grandmother,
                    almost every summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your mother grow up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: She grew up in Jersey City. Her dad, whom I never met—he died when I
                    was about a year old—had run a tavern and was active in the Democratic Party in
                    New Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Boss Haig?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Haig was coming along. He later came to dominate the political
                    scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Democratic Party in that area was the archetypical
                        boss type machine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes. Of course, you had varying estimates of what contributions
                    or what damage the late mayor Haig did to Jersey City, but my grandmother, for
                    example, found his paternalistic role in politics in Jersey City admirable. He
                    was always prepared to help people, probably largely Irish people, who needed
                    assistance in various wayfinding a job, money of some sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thing about some of the machines was, their great
                        strength was that they delivered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes, that's why she admired him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As opposed to some which seemed more of a kleptocracy.
                        Your mother did not go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, she went to secretarial school. Catherine Gibbs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the preeminent secretarial school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: She worked for a period of time. When she met my father, she was
                    driving on her own. She married and started having children, and gave up
                    driving. I can remember when my sister and my wife took her for driving lessons
                    to regain her license.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the time you were in Jersey City?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I have very fond memories of my childhood there. Mostly, they
                    concerned visits to both my maternal and paternal grandmothers and friends and
                    extended family. A very happy childhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Erie, what was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: He had joined a firm which is big in Erie and in much of Pennsylvania
                    called the Erie Insurance Exchange. He worked for them for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Erie like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was a grand place for a child to grow up. Lots of parks. It's on
                    Lake Erie. It boasts a state park called the Peninsula. Miles and miles of
                    beaches. Wonderful water sports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was home life like? Was there much getting around the
                        dinner table and talking about things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I have happy memories of a family life that was very warm and
                    enriching. We breakfasted and dined together every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Erie's pretty far away when you think about it. All of a
                        sudden, you're basically in the Midwest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about politics in the family? Was there a political
                        thrust to your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Both my parents were registered Democrats and I have always been
                    sympathetic to the philosophy of the Democratic Party. Because of their example
                    and the values which they displayed and inculcated in me and my siblings, I
                    remain, perhaps particularly right now, a Democrat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether politics were a part of your early
                        childhood. Was there family talk about Roosevelt and the New Deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Absolutely, there was always talk about what was going on
                    politically. My parents never got involved themselves in politics very much but
                    they followed primaries and general elections very closely and encouraged us to
                    be interested and discuss what was in the newspaper about this or that
                    politician and what he or she was advocating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In elementary school, what subjects interested you and
                        didn't interest you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I can't think of one subject in which I had no interest at all. I was
                    very interested in everything, perhaps particularly in geography and
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you read much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: As much as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any books that you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: From that time, I would be hard-pressed to recall many titles. I
                    received in those days, as most boys did, books on birthdays and at
                    Christmastime like the Rover Boys series and another series that both my older
                    brother and I were very keen on. We collected all those and reread them very
                    much. I remember reading Shame of Motley. by Raphael Sabatini. Similar novels
                    were always interesting to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were about 10, the war came. Were you
                        reading a lot about the war? Did the war engage you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, very much so. I can recall very vividly December 7th when we
                    were half listening to a radio program and probably reading the Sunday paper and
                    there was the interruption to announce the attack on Pearl Harbor. We were being
                    feisty and my father said, “Listen. Pay attention. This is important to you.”
                    That's when I learned of the war. And then of course, like every American kid, I
                    followed it very, very closely. One New York habit that my parents kept was
                    reading New York newspapers. I think it was the “New York Daily News” which
                    published daily maps that showed the progress of allied and axis forces. I
                    followed those closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same thing. Places like Wake Island and Sidi
                        Barani and Rostov really stuck in your mind, the horrible failure of the
                        millions who were killed but for young American boyparticularly boys at that
                        poinit was a great geography lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, indeed. You always prayed that we good guys would win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were fixated on maps because of the global nature of
                        the war. Did you get involved in activities young boys would get involved
                        with in Erie during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: War-related activities?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, we all bought and sold defense savings stamps and bonds. Savings
                    bonds were not an unusual gift for a kid. There were materials that were needed
                    for the war effortinfoil, rubber tires, scrap metal, etc. There were always
                    drives to collect that sort of thing. And there were drives to collect clothing
                    for refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to high school in Erie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, in those days, what was Erie doing? I can
                        recall going through there 10 years ago and it's like mile after mile of
                        deserted factories.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Like most of the cities of the northeast, it is part of the extended
                    Rust Belt. When I was a child, all of those factories were turning out
                    everything you can imagine. It was an industrial town with a population of about
                    114,000. That has been reversed and there has been a flight of both industry and
                    of people from the city to the suburbs so that now my sister, who still lives in
                    Erie, lives in a suburban area which when I was a kid was farmland and is now
                    full of people. That has drained the life of the city. As a matter of fact, I
                    don't get back there that often, but several buildings that were identified with
                    the town have been demolished and there is kind of a suburbanization of the core
                    urban areas. On what had been the main shopping street, I don't think there is a
                    single department store left now. They're all out in surrounding malls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in high school from '43 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: To '49. It was junior high school and senior high school. I know that
                    fashions change. It used to be 7th, 8th, and 9th grade for junior high and 10th,
                    11th, and 12th for senior high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the student body like? Was it diverse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Pretty diverse. There were not that many black students at school.
                    The black population of Erie tended to live on the eastern part of the city. I
                    went to a school called Academy High. Then there was also an East High, a Strong
                    Vincent High, and a Central Technical High School. In Academy, there were just a
                    very few blacks, but there was no problem racially that I can remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: My attraction continued for history/ political science, geography
                    (which was then taught seriously as a subject)... Starting in 7th grade, I took
                    Latin and then later Spanish. I often remember wishing that my father had
                    maintained his Norwegian. He could until he died read letters from family in
                    Norwegian, but his spoken Norwegian had disappeared. I'm not sure I ever felt
                    that way about Gaelic because it was not as big a deal among the Irish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a lot of the Irish, Gaelic was also kind of a dead

                <p>MARTHINSEN: If you go to Ireland, you'll see there are very few areas where they
                    speak Gaelic.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was never a great sportsman, though I tried my hand at and played
                    badly tennis and later golf. But I was not a runner nor a swimmer. I never made
                    a team.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: I got into a few plays. I don't think my presence on the American
                    stage has been missed, but I enjoyed it and the good company involved. In high
                    school, I enjoyed debate. We had a very extensive schedule for interschool
                    debates and then state finals and regional finals. That was fun and a good way
                    to get to know other students.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. When we were growing up, we lived next to a family that had a
                    small milk processing and distributing plant. They always needed help. Like my
                    brother before me, I learned how to wash milk bottles, which were of glass in
                    those days and were returned to the plant to be washed and refilled. Without
                    understanding very much about it, we watched the homogenization process and the
                    bottling of milk. I had other jobs like delivering newspapers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: My parents always assumed that we would all go to college and
                    encouraged us in that direction. Whenever grades came out, they'd say, “This
                    would be good for your college aspirations... or not so good.”</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Gannon University is a fairly new school. It began as Cathedral
                    College in the late 1920s. It had just been reorganized as Gannon College and
                    was beginning to expand as a community school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Erie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. Gannon produced a quiz program hosted by one of its great
                    professors, now deceased, Gordon Beyer. In it, questions about world and
                    Pennsylvania history were addressed to panels of students. After I went through
                    a series of competitions with other students from various local schools, I won a
                    4 year full tuition scholarship to Gannon, which was pretty great. Financially,
                    that was very helpful. At the same time, we had in Pennsylvania state senatorial
                    scholarships. I won one of those, too. The two grants covered much of the
                    expense of my attending college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the school like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Gannon was an interesting experience and I think very good for those
                    of us who had just graduated from high school. The GI Bill was still in effect
                    and we had a fair number of veterans attending while I was there. These were
                    older, experienced students, but they were a tremendous addition to classroom
                    discussions. The faculty was talented and diverse, home-grown and imported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What courses did you concentrate on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I bet you could guess. My interest in political science focused at
                    the time on the creation and development of the UN. Also, American politics
                    were, as always, endlessly fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later, you ended up in the Middle East. Did that cross
                        your radar at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not a hint of it. When I was first assigned abroad as an FSO, it was
                    to Dacca in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. I had studied Spanish in high school
                    and I has taken a few excellent courses in college. I did reasonably well on the
                    FSI language exam in Spanish, but I knew that I needed time in an environment
                    where Spanish was spoken in order to really acquire the language. So, I
                    outsmarted myself. At that time, the Department was very interested in
                    attracting people to Arabic language and area studies. I wrote to Personnel and
                    said, “I've been thinking about Arabic language and area studies and in order to
                    confirm my interest, I would like to be assigned to Spain, where I could perfect
                    my Spanish and, of course, have a glimpse at North African Arab world.” In less
                    than 2 weeks, I got a message back saying that “Your application for Arabic
                    language and area studies has been accepted.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The '48 birth of Israel and all that didn't resonate at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It did, not the least because two of Gannon's faculty members were
                    rabbis. The archbishop for whom the university was named was very interested in
                    ecumenical efforts and wanted to expose the students to as many diverse points
                    of view as possible. I don't think there were very many Arabs, much less
                    Muslims, in the US at that time. I don't recall any on the faculty. But learning
                    about the Middle East from these Americans of the Jewish faith inclined me to
                    sympathize with the supporters of Israel. I was not very discriminating. While I
                    believe that we're hardly in a position as Americans to hurl many stones, the
                    Israelis have been pretty much in the business of taking other people's land and
                    settling it. That has been my conclusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time, this was something you had heard

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes, but in terms of plucky Israel, a democratic state fighting
                    for its very existence against the massed hordes of the surrounding Arab
                    countries That was all the press, the radio and television had to say.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. We had a campus newspaper which I edited. I was a member of the
                    International Relations Club and the Intercollegiate Conference on Government.
                    At that time, there were no fraternities on campus. Though I was a complete
                    washout in sports, I enjoyed collegiate life. I learned how to drink beer and
                    important stuff like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the school coeducational?</hi>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: At that time, no, it was not. It has since become coeducational with
                    the merger of Gannon University and Villa Maria College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the students at Gannon in those days go for

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Fortunately, there were lots of good looking girls from our high
                    school days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were going to be graduating in about 1953?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, that was the plan, However, the Korean War was raging; the army
                    was using up second lieutenants at a ferocious rate; Uncle Sam needed more. ROTC
                    was compulsory for Gannon students who were not veterans. I took Military
                    Science as one of my mandatory courses and attended summer camp at Fort Gordon
                    (then Camp Gordon) in Georgia. In those days, campuses around the country
                    specialized in different branches. Gannon's was MPs. Can you imagine? Summer in
                    Georgia for infantry training? It was grim, but in a way it prepared me for the
                    Middle East. Then our graduation was moved up by six months; we had to go to
                    summer school. I graduated in January, was immediately sworn into the army, and
                    went back to Fort Gordon for a stint of training. I was then transferred to Fort
                    Monroe, Virginia to the 559th Military Police Company. Traffic control and
                    running a guard house were our chief missions during that period of a year or
                    so. Then the war in Korea ended and the need for additional second lieutenants
                    slackened. A lot of us, including me, were released from service earlier than we
                    had expected we would be. I had served just under 2 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did police work interest you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not very much, though it was interesting to work with a variety of
                    people from high-ranking officers to minimum security prisoners whom we employed
                    to maintain the appearance of the post. A captain commanded and there were 2
                    second lieutenants who shared responsibility for running the guardhouse and
                    running traffic control and security operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Fort Monroe doing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Headquarters of Continental Army command. I have not followed up on
                    military organizations as assiduously as I might have, so I don't know what it
                    is today. But in those days, it was kind of neat because we were, say, 10-12
                    first and second lieutenants and there were 10-12 general officers. There were
                    platoons of full colonels and light colonels, and a sprinkling of majors and
                    captains. The senior officers on post had families, including some very
                    attractive girls, and that made for an interesting and pleasurable social
                    life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there in March with a Civil War group. It's now one
                        of the Defense Universities' homes. It's got a training facility. Troops
                        aren't drilling all over the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: They were not drilling all over the place when I was there either. It
                    supported a major command. With so many senior military army officers, there
                    were many retirements. I don't know what the rule was, but apparently many army
                    officers who had the rank of colonel and who were going to retire would get to
                    have a final parade plus a B.G.'s star. Scratching together enough soldiers who
                    would make a soldierly appearance for retirement parades was a chore. Our MPs
                    were always splendid-looking with nifty uniforms. Then there was the
                    Transportation Car Company; they were not the most soldierly guys. And then
                    there were casuals—enlisted personnel who were cooks and clerks and that sort of
                    thing. There was also a gaggle of WACs, female soldiers. You try to form a
                    parade with such a cast. It was all I could do to keep a straight face.</p>

                        Korean hordes at Fort Monroe in Virginia, what were you thinking about doing
                        after you'd completed this task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I thought at that time that I wanted to go to law school. When I was
                    in college, I worked part-time for a wonderful gentleman, a lawyer in Erie,
                    named Jackson Enean. He planted the seed of a Foreign Service career in my head.
                    When we chatted, and we often did, he suggested that he would have loved to have
                    been a Foreign Service officer and serve his country abroad. The more he talked
                    about what might have been for him, the more attractive it seemed to me. So,
                    rather than applying to law school, after my army service I applied to and was
                    accepted by Georgetown University for their Foreign Service exam cram course.
                    The course was basically a quick review of everything you had learned when you
                    were in college. I came down to Washington and lived on 17th Street and
                    Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: 1955 in December.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the composition of the A100 course and how
                        it went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It went very well indeed. My classmates were mostly men; there were
                    few women. I never served with any of them; we all went our different ways. I
                    suppose most tended to specialize in particular areas, as it turned out I would.
                    I read with interest in the “Journal” and other notifications about the doings
                    of my classmates. In those days, the A100 course included a trip to New York,
                    which I remember very clearly.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came in in '55. I remember going to the Andrea Doria.
                        Did you stay at the Seaman's Rest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, downtown, lower Manhattan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an interesting place. I guess you saw the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, I was game for anything. I had done pretty well in my life thus
                    far just rolling with the punches. I had decided to try for the Foreign Service
                    and I had succeeded in that; I was prepared to take any assignment that came my
                    way. I was very naive and hideously uninformed about geographic and cultural
                    climates around the world. I had never investigated, for example, the
                    subcontinent very closely. Therefore, I was mystified when, at the end of our
                    A100 course, they were reading aloud names the assignments. I was assigned to
                    Dacca, East Pakistan. There was a sharp intake of breath from my fellows because
                    Dacca had a well deserved reputation for being a trying assignment given the
                    climate and amenities or lack thereof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went out to Dacca in 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '57. I was broken out of the A100 course that I had started with and
                    along with one other officer was loaned to the predecessor of AID, ECA/ TCA. I
                    went to work in the Near East, South Asia Program Division (NESA). Cedric Seager
                    was the director. I worked for a lady named Marie Berger, a Chicagoan, and a
                    very admirable boss and friend. Then at the end of that assignment, which was
                    mostly spent in preparing congressional presentations, I returned to FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they put you back in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Then I rejoined the ongoing A100 course.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: In '57.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Until '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Stocky Everetts there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, he was in Karachi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came in with me in my A100 course. You must have been
                        class 5 or 6. We were class one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: My boss in Dacca was William “Bill” Williams, an experienced FSO. He
                    was succeeded by Nathaniel King, an LBJ appointee and a prince of a guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Dacca this '57 to '59 period, what was
                        Dacca like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: My father-in-law-to-be painted for relaxation and turned out some
                    rather skillful paintings more or less in the Grandma Moses style, American
                    primitive. And he has “A View of Nawabpur Road” which still hangs on a wall at
                    our house. That's what Dacca was like; chockablock full of pedicabs and cattle
                    and ladies in various stages of being enveloped in burkas and saris and children
                    and birds. Dacca was a mob scene most of the time. Of course, Bangladesh at that
                    time had half the population that it has today. It was considered by AID experts
                    to be heavily overpopulated. When I first went there, sanitation was a problem.
                    Death rates from cholera and smallpox were extraordinarily high. If the death
                    rate did not exceed 500 in a given week, then there was no “epidemic.” Annually
                    10,000 people or so would die in floods. Just a few inches rise of water meant a
                    disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you experience floods while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: None that affected us in Dacca, but they occurred frequently in other
                    parts of the province. The demand for agricultural land is so great that, as
                    islands of silt appeared in the various rivers, they were immediately turned to
                    farm lands. Such lands were a very dangerous place to live. They could be swept
                    away in the next highly predictable floods. India was building a great barrage
                    north of Calcutta about the time I left. That was supposed to permit some flood
                    control. I hope that has happened, although from what I've read, the Bengalis
                    are still dying from other inundations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government like? It was part of
                        Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: There was a governor general in Dacca. In my day, it was Faslul
                    Haq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was economic/commercial officer in Dacca. Max Hodge headed the two
                    man office. Mostly we kept track of jute production. I never knew there were so
                    many grades of jute. In those days, the industry was pretty much as the Brits
                    had organized it. We were also following the transportation sector. River
                    transport was extremely important in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does jute come from in East Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It is grown in all of the watery bottomlands; the province is mostly
                    watery bottomlands. You don't get into hills in Bangladesh until you go down to
                    the Chittagong area or Sylhet north central part—that's tea country. The rest of
                    it is like a billiard table after a night of carousing: flat, green, and
                    wet.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not that I know of. Jute is more comparable more to cotton. The
                    business of grading it and processing it or semi-processing it and manufacturing
                    cloth and rugs was the major economic activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you had a local employee who knew what was going
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes, our Foreign Service would not exist if it were not for
                    skilled local employees. I had an aide who was terrific. He also was my
                    translator although, happily, many Bengalis spoke English, particularly those in
                    the jute trade and transportation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the consulate general like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The consulate general—now an embassy— up until very recently was the
                    same as it was when I was there. The office was within sight of the former
                    Nawab's palace in Motajeel. We were on 4th and 5th or 5th and 6th floors of the
                    Adamjeenagar, a new and relatively, but not totally, watertight building. It was
                    a glass-domed office building that housed State and AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling for the Bangladeshi or East
                        Bengali relationship with the Pakistanis? I'm thinking of the people from
                        West Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Absolutely. West Pakistanis speak a different language. Mohammed Ali
                    Jinnah had organized the Pakistan government and chose Karachi as the capital. I
                    think most East Pakistanis believed that they made the money and the West
                    Pakistanis took a commission. The major export of Pakistan was raw jute. I don't
                    even think much of it was processed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody there looking at this as maybe the sea of a
                        rebellion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Unfortunately, the division of Pakistan into the provinces fostered
                    political difficulties. The sole glue holding the country together was Islam.
                    Fortunately when I was there, there was no serious violence. Though when martial
                    law was declared by Karachi, it had a big effect on East Bengal. A lot of
                    Pushtus, Baluchis, Sindhis and others from the west, came into Dacca to take
                    over the newly created military administration. That turned off the local
                    populace because it meant the end of self-government. Ethnic tensions grew.
                    Prior to martial law, Bengalis had their own parliament and all of the Bengalis
                    followed the affairs of their legislative assembly closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to make friends with people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, very easily. The people with whom I had most of my contacts were
                    in the economic departments of the East Pakistan government or in the private
                    business community. Most spoke English. As was true in much of ex-India, they
                    were carrying on pretty much as they had during the days of the Raj. There was
                    no interruption in the flow of jute, much less of mangos and bananas and other
                    products that were traded.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The story I tell is that I was minding my own business walking
                    through the jungle one day when this gorgeous creature swung down from the trees
                    and glommed onto me. That is not quite true. My father- in-law-to-be was a staff
                    member at the consulate general, working in political affairs. Kate was then 18
                    or 19. . . I was much younger, too, in those days. She was off at school.
                    Initially she had been sent to school in India and then she started university.
                    She was taking a year at Louvain in Belgium and came back on leave. I met her
                    when she was back home in Dacca for vacation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We got married in November 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Dacca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, we wanted to make sure it held. In the interim, her parents, Herb
                    and Margaret Hooker were transferred. They went to Rome. Kate and I by then were
                    destined to strike out together, so we thought, “Rome isn't bad for a wedding.
                    We can make do.” My future mother-in-law arranged for the wedding at the
                    Vatican. We were married in the Choir Chapel on November 2, 1959, just after my
                    tour had ended in Dacca and I was headed back home and on to my next post,
                    Beirut. Kate had encouraged me saying, “You're going to love Beirut. You're
                    going to love Lebanon and the Arab world.” She had lived for 5 or 7 years as a
                    kid in Cairo. So, I was marrying a “Bint Al-Balad”— “a daughter of the
                    country.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you studied Arabic in Beirut for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was a 2 year course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be '59 to '61.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, I didn't get there until '60. We were married in November. In
                    those days, one could return to the United States or go to a posting abroad by
                    ship. That tracked out nicely for us and our honeymoon. We sailed to New York
                    and were met in New York City by my parents. It was a great experience except
                    that my bride did not turn out to be as good a sailor as she had thought she
                    was. It was kind of a rough ride.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Beirut was wonderful, incredible. I found out how right Kate had
                    been. We loved it. We loved our experience in a very cosmopolitan city. Our sole
                    problem was getting Lebanese to speak Arabic with us because they were so gifted
                    linguistically. They could carry on a conversation in English or French or
                    probably Turkish or Armenian at the drop of a hat, which we found exhilarating.
                    It was a city where you could turn right and go for dinner a la francais or turn
                    left and go for Arab cuisine in an Arabic milieu. It was wonderful. AUB was
                    going great guns in those days. It was fairly enjoyable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you take to Arabic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I took to it rather well. I was helped, of course, by Kate's
                    experience in Egypt. She would speak to me in Arabic and others would, too.
                    Mastering differences in sounds took a lot of practice in front of a mirror. By
                    the end of the course I could converse with people from most Arabic language
                    countries pretty well, especially if they were educated. I could recognize the
                    differences in accents. We say “Arabic,” but there is a big difference between
                    Beiruti Arabic and Mountain Arabic in Lebanon. It differs too from Damascus
                    Arabic—which is just a couple of hours' drive away, which has an accent
                    different from Aleppo, which is different in turn from that of Amman or
                    Palestine. All are different from Najdi or Hejazi Arabic. Egyptian to a non-Arab
                    sounds almost like a different language because of the different pronunciations
                    and, often, vocabulary differences.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of your fellow students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Dick Murphy and Morris Draper overlapped with us a year or so. Kent
                    Whitehead. George Lane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Lebanon at the time? In '58, it had gone through
                        an incipient civil war. We put troops in there for a while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It had become an amusing memory for most Beirutis. Many who recalled
                    the landing were swimming that day at the beach. “What are all these ships doing
                    here?” they asked. They directed the troops towards the Coke and ice cream
                    vendors. Robert McClintock was the ambassador and people still tell stories
                    about his coming in with the troops with his poodle dog in tow. That excited
                    much comment among Beirut. But they were otherwise tremendously relaxed about
                    it. It was nothing like the bitterness that accompanied the violence in '74.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes, his influence had extended throughout the Arab world. In
                    those days, FSI sent its language and area trainees on an area orientation trip.
                    Our trip included visits to Syria, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt,
                    Israel, and Jordan. It was a truly wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: To all those places. We were on a military aircraft. The order was
                    different. I think we started out in Turkey, but then we went to all those
                    countries. It was a very rewarding experience that really introduced us to the
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the accusations that has been put forward is that
                        State Department trained Arabists are ipso facto anti-Semitic and against
                        Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That's horse feathers. Arabs are Semites, too. I'm afraid that we are
                    heavily prejudiced towards the Israelis as a nation and as a people and I think
                    that the Israelis nurture that prejudice very, very, very successfully
                    regardless of the cost not to the Israeli treasury, but to the U.S. Treasury.
                    That has been probably the greatest disappointment in my professional life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously it's a major problem. But were you feeling any

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We got from Department sources sort of praise, honor, and glory to
                    the plucky Israeli democrats and all that business, whereas Zionists were busily
                    establishing a theocratic state on the remains of the Indian reservations which
                    were left to the Palestinian people. The Lebanese and others in the region had
                    perhaps understandable sympathy for their mostly coreligionists in what was left
                    of Palestine. The villains in the peace were the British. They and the French
                    had diddled the Arab nationalists to a fare-thee-well in the wake of World War I
                    and then proceeded not only to divide up the region into the states, which we
                    pretty much know today, but also to promise the same land to British Zionists as
                    they promised to the Arabs.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: That's right. That's turning a good trick: Give away to others what
                    is not yours to give.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did one see that if you dealt in the Arab world, you

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, because there were officers who did serve in both. If you were an
                    Arabist or an Hebraist, you wanted to use your Arabic or Hebrew and so you
                    wanted to be in an Arab country or in Israel. Of course, it wouldn't be a big
                    recommendation if you came straight from Tel Aviv to Beirut or Damascus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up from your fellow officers and

                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Mostly as understandable. Much of the Western world, certainly London
                    and Paris, were upset by the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the RCC
                    revolution in Egypt. Very few people had much sympathy or understanding for
                    Farouk and the fall of his dynasty. In my recollection, there was a similar
                    amount of popular sympathy for the Mossadegh revolution, later crushed in
                    Teheran. The monarchical system hadn't shown much in either country. I know that
                    Nasser had a great rallying effect on Arab nationalists who wanted to change the
                    status quo. But that is the story of all revolutions, as it was the story of our
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was only 2 years after the overthrow of Faisal and
                        Iraq. It was July 14th of '58. How was that looked upon, the emergence of
                        the Baath Party and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That's a very interesting subject to discuss. Even as we speak, we're
                    determined that we'd like to see a US sponsored regime emerge in Iraq that would
                    be democratic. I've even heard the word “secular” used. Fat chance of running
                    into a secular regime in the Middle East. But if that is desirable, then the
                    Baath Party as it was originally construed, largely by Michel Aflaq, a Syrian
                    Christian, and which sought to erect a wall of separation between mosque and
                    state, was a positive development. I'm not sure we're following the right course
                    in blaming everything on Baathism and the Baath Party. Saddam Hussein, like his
                    Syrian counterparts, has over the years twisted Baathi doctrine to suit his own
                    purposes. But there has always been a strain of secularism in the movement.
                    Actually, until and unless that happens, the Middle East is going to be
                    cursed... if you believe as I do that theocracies are a curse.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: After a while, one grew accustomed to coups in Baghdad. I visited the
                    city, which was quite an experience. Very disagreeable, very challenging climate
                    to deal with. It seems to me that whether it was one of the Aref brothers or it
                    was Abdul Karim Kassem or anyone else, it was more of the same.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It's all very relative. Saddam Hussein was nothing to write home
                    about: he has a singularly disagreeable character and is very cruel. But he
                    shared that with many others, and not just Arabs, but other people who have less
                    than high regard for their fellow citizens.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No. Having worked rather hard for two years, I just wanted to go to
                    any Arab country to try to perfect my language. This was before I really
                    appreciated the differences among the dialects. My first tour after training was
                    in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. I thought, “This is very close to the heart of the
                    Arab world and it should be very good.” And it was very good. Jeddah in those
                    days was a pretty sophisticated city with a variety of peoples, Muslims
                    certainly, but from all parts of the Arab world. It was an interesting
                    experience. And Saudi society was fascinating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Then crown prince Faisal Bin Abd Al-Aziz was the power behind the
                    throne. King Saud Bin Abd Al-Aziz was being eased out of the picture.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: Jeddah waand it was the embassy then; there was nothing in Riyadh—a
                    small political section. I handled consular affairs and helped with reporting on
                    political developments. Very little in the Saudi media was reportable. This was
                    well before “Al Jazeera” came on to blow the whistle on various Arab governments
                    and personalities. We had good contacts with the ministry of foreign affairs,
                    which was collocated in Jeddah. The rest of the government was in Riyadh, which
                    I visited only a couple of times; American oil company personnel were more
                    common in Riyadh than were U.S. diplomats. Even the ambassador went to Riyadh
                    only occasionally.</p>
                <p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: Parker Hart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an Arabist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. He spoke limited Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Turkish, too. What were some of the issues that
                        concerned the embassy and you yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: As has been the case in the Middle East for half a century, there was
                    always the threat of war related to the Arab-Israeli dispute. And there was a
                    growing tension between Riyadh and Cairo. While we were in Saudi Arabia, the
                    Yemen civil war broke out, and the Saudis were backing the Imam's forces and
                    Gamal Abdel Nasser was supporting the Yemeni republican forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They put quite a few troops down there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. The large Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which kind of tilted the
                    fighting towards the republicans. The Yemeni royalists wounded were brought up
                    to Jeddah for medical treatment. Interesting story there. A Lebanese physician
                    who was on the staff of the hospital in Jeddah said it was extraordinary how
                    when they'd bring in someone with a really serious wound, you could see the
                    wound heal itself even as you watched. Yemeni children who survive childhood
                    build up such immunities that they're enormously hardy. Well, having said that,
                    they still died and so did republicans. That led in time to overflights of Saudi
                    soil by Egyptian aircraft and the threat of war. The whole affair was a struggle
                    for influence between the Saudis and the Egyptians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, we did. There were a fair number of Saudis who had studied in
                    the United States and who were interested in socializing with Americans. The
                    Saudi social system afforded opportunities for wives, too, to join in dinners
                    and parties of various kinds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, but a lot of the wives were not Saudis. They were Lebanese,
                    Syrian, Egyptian, and often Western. Saudis often married foreign, more
                    liberated women.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at all at some of the internal
                        developments in Saudi Arabia which lately have come to our attention in
                        rather dramatic form? I'm thinking particularly of the school system where
                        the ruling party apparently turned over the school system to this religious
                        Wahhabi side of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The Saudi schools have always been subject to the influence of the
                    Wahhabi movement, which is, after all, the religious persuasion of the royal
                    family and which has had an alliance with the House of Saud since the 1700s.
                    Wahhabism represents a main prop of the kingdom. Koranic schools (madrasas), are
                    all under the influence of the Wahhabi movement. Remember that while I was in
                    Jeddah, the first ever royal prince to get a degree from an American university
                    graduated; it was kind of the beginning of what you might call the development
                    of a modernizing elite and they obviously still have a long way to go. At the
                    time, there were a number of other Saudis who had been to the United States and
                    Europe who hoped for the modernization of the country and gradual change. They
                    were mostly the kids of prominent commercial families in Jeddah so far as I
                    could tell.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Absolutely. Among our best personal friends in Jeddah were the ARAMCO
                    rep. and his wife, Clark and Mary Sipher. They retired later in California.
                    Clark ran a 3-man office in Jeddah. ARAMCO had an office in Riyadh and their
                    main office in Dhahran, with which the consulate dealt, in the Eastern Province.
                    ARAMCO was enormously influential. But also while we were there the great shift
                    towards Saudi ownership of oil production facilities began. Concession
                    arrangements were replaced by state ownership. That change seems to have worked
                    out reasonably well.</p>
                <p>I tell you what was really a major event while we were in Saudi Arabia. That was
                    the assassination of President Kennedy. Saudis showed at that time the most
                    moving sympathy for our country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was interesting how this affected all over the world. I
                        was in a communist country at the time, Yugoslavia, and people were lined
                        up... It was really something.MARTHINSEN: Yes, it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at the Palestinian influence in Saudi
                        Arabia? Palestinians were very much like the Chinese in Indonesia running
                        many things. Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not that I can remember. It seemed to me that the Saudis kept a
                    pretty close control on all non-Saudi Arabs. Palestinians were influential.
                    Their ambitions, desires, and feelings were, as you might expect them to be, at
                    odds with ours regarding the Middle East. But otherwise so far as I know, they
                    mostly performed their jobs as teachers, administrators, businessmen, doctors
                    etc. The business arrangements were usually in the form of a partnership with a
                    Saudi national who was responsible for them and how they behaved. They were a
                    kind of leavening agent in Saudi society. By and large, Palestinians were better
                    educated and more sophisticated than the Saudis, who were just getting
                    started... When I was there, the very first girls' school ever in the kingdom
                    was opened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were also there before the great influx of labor from
                        the Philippines and Indonesia and Bangladesh and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That influx had started; the word was out that Filipinas were
                    marvelous nannies. I think that maybe a major task imposed on the Saudi
                    diplomats around the world was to keep an eye out for good nannies, chauffeurs,
                    nurses, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we seeing Saudi Arabia developing? Were we
                        looking for a successor to the House of Saud?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: As usual, I think we were inclined to want to have our cake and eat
                    it, too. We wanted what we call “stability” and yet we wanted secularism and
                    progressive democracy. But they don't always work together and you can't make an
                    omelet without breaking an egg, as we have experienced in our history. Other
                    countries go through the same thing. That's a very interesting question which
                    you can attack at several levels. You get down to the basic level and that is
                    the philosophy of the people involved. Theocracies and democracies and that sort
                    of thing... There has always been a concern that there might be a revolution in
                    Saudi Arabia; we were very conscious of the possibility of that. But as far as I
                    can remember in my day, there were no hints of serious dissent anywhere, no
                    Shia-Sunni conflicts, at least that we heard about. There were always questions
                    about the regimes in power in Sanaa or Aden. One of the last shifts of
                    sovereignty over a chunk of the Middle East— after the Brits and the French had
                    divvied up most of the Middle East—was the Asir province, the southernmost
                    province of the Hejaz, which the Saudis seized from Yemen in the '20s. There was
                    always concern that an effort to reunify Asir with Yemen might occur, but
                    nothing ever came of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about along the Persian Gulf area? Were they having
                        problems with the British as a surrogate, at that time the Trucial States
                        over the Buraimi Oasis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The Gulf Emirates of the lower Gulf in '61 joined into what is today
                    an expanded Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The UAE took form in about '61. That
                    was the same year in which Qatar and Bahrain received independence. They were
                    originally going to join in that confederation but they opted out with, I think,
                    Qatar following Bahrain's lead.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Jeddah, the subject of Israel and

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, it always does. It always will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I would try to explain the reasons for American sympathy for Zionist
                    aspirations in Israel and the fact that the American Congress and most American
                    political leaders were not only sympathetic towards the Israelis but also
                    sympathetic towards the Palestinians and interested in working out a solution to
                    the Palestine problem. I believe that I never made it to first base.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this was before the '67 war and the acquisition
                        of the West Bank, which exacerbated everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: You bet. We left Saudi Arabia and went to Damascus in 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Damascus in '64.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '64 to '67. We left in the spring of '67 to the sound of Syrian jets
                    being shot down by Israeli fighter aircraft south of the city and a pretty
                    strong suspicion that it was all going to hit the fan pretty soon. Tensions had
                    been developing for over a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to Damascus in '64. How was your Arabic by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: By that time, it was pretty good. It was pretty good Hejazi Arabic.
                    Then I had to learn how to sing Arabic in the Damascus manner. That was another
                    good experience. Syrians we found very friendly and welcoming and much more
                    relaxed as a society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was pre-Baathi. It was a military dictatorship with the trappings
                    of democracy. While we were there, the Baathi coup occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was an economic/AID officer. It was an interesting marriage of an
                    AID office and State econ. under a counselor of embassy, AID's John Tobler.
                    There were Norm Pratt, the economic officer and on the AID side, John Moore. I
                    worked for both of them. We had a number of AID programs going on with the
                    Syrians and we were interested in the economic life and developments in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic life like then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was pretty good. The standard of living in Syria was quite
                    reasonable by Middle Eastern standards. The people whom we tended to meet and
                    associate with were home-owning, car-owning, traveling businesspeople. While we
                    were there, there was a series of nationalizations of industry, which presented
                    big problems for many of these people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Syria has some elements making it, if not a wealthy, a
                        moderately economically viable state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had good crops and were training people and all of
                        this and yet... How was that working out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I think the economy has never really faltered. It took some serious
                    hits at the time of the nationalizations but from all I've read and heard, they
                    weathered that and worked out a bureaucratic solution to the problem.
                    Agriculture has almost always been very healthy. Production is mostly for the
                    domestic market; they don't get involved in much exporting. Maybe a bit to Iraq
                    and perhaps to Turkey. The most serious problem that the Syrians faced and still
                    face—nothing ever changes in the Middle East—is that there is a kind of folk
                    memory or ambition or idea that historic Syria has a claim to legitimacy.
                    Historic Syria is today's Syria plus Hatay, which the Turks seized when the
                    French were ruling Damascus—the chunk of Turkey that dips down into Syria;
                    Lebanon, which we hear about from time to time; And Palestine, that is Palestine
                    including Jordan. These were all parts of the Ummayad Empire and, earlier, of
                    the realm of the Selucids, heirs of Alexander. That is historic or greater
                    Syria. They think still that those areas should belong to Damascus. I think
                    that's their problem and may account for the special relationship between Syria
                    and Lebanon as well as the problem of what's left of Palestine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Damascus and Syrian society? Could you
                        get around? Was it a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: After the coup, it was much more of a problem because the society
                    kind of closed down. Prior to that, it reminded one a bit of Beirut, very open
                    and rather free notwithstanding the nature of the government. There were a lot
                    of Syrians who had language skills other than Arabic, had traveled widely in
                    Europe and the United States, and had business ties with the US. It was very
                    comfortable living.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to the coup, how about Soviet influence? Was this a
                        big deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The Soviet presence was quite large, more so after the coup. Moscow
                    financed some major development projects such as the Euphrates Dam and some
                    power work. Most of the military equipment that the Syrians imported came from
                    the Soviet Union. At the same time, during our stint in Damascus, the Soviets
                    mounted a “Be kind to Americans” campaign. They encouraged contacts between
                    their embassy staff and our's. We were told by the ambassador we should respond
                    and if we should feel so inclined, we should reciprocate their overtures. I
                    remember hosting a carefully contrived dinner part at our house. We invited my
                    Soviet counterpart and his wife. The only thing that was mildly disturbing was
                    that an additional Soviet came along I guess to watch over us—a minder,
                    perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the coup. What was the situation before
                        the coup and how did the coup happen and what were we doing during
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was a power struggle between competing groups of officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Baaths were not in power at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, not as a party. When the French withdrew from Damascus, they left
                    in place a rather feeble parliamentary regime which was soon overthrown—there
                    have been so many coups d'etat in Damascus over the years, I've lost track. In
                    any event, it swiftly turned into a kind of colonel's rule: military dictators
                    took over. So far as we could tell, there was a rising sense of vexation with
                    military rule; not infrequently military officers don't view the world as other
                    people do. So it was a competition between factions within the military, one or
                    another abetted by the Baath party, which had an organization with cells
                    throughout the society. Literally they ended up fighting with tanks and infantry
                    in the streets of Damascus. Thinking they were having one of their regular coups
                    d'etats, most of our Damascus neighbors, very nice people, invited us to come up
                    on the roof and see the action going on. One of the senior officers didn't
                    realize he was being ousted from power; he held out when his house was attacked
                    by tanks just a few blocks away. So there was a very exciting artillery duel to
                    witness. By dawn another regime emerged. It was military and pro-Baathi.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: Two. Ridgway Knight was there when we first arrived. Hugh Smythe, a
                    political appointee, succeeded Knight. Smythe was an experienced educator.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was pretty hopeless. The Syrians had to decide who they were, what
                    they wanted, and where they were going on their own. As you recall, they united
                    with Egypt for a few years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. That was a serious development that reflected the desires of
                    many politically conscious , patriotic Syrians who could submerge their Syrian
                    identity for the sake of a union of the Arabs. There has always been this
                    romantic idea that all Arabs starting from their homeland in what is today Saudi
                    Arabia all across North Africa to the Sudan and east along the Peninsula are one
                    people. Many believe they could recreate the Ummayad or Abbasi Empire.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, yes, definitely. That's why there used to be 3 stars on the UAR

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Askance because it was socialist. The Baath favored the
                    nationalization of the means of production and all that other good stuff that
                    the Labour Party used to stand for in Britain.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: No serious contacts to my knowledge. I never heard my military
                    colleaguewe had several attachetalk about their contacts with Baathi
                    representatives or indeed with any of the groups within the army. Syria had gone
                    through a period of time when there was one military coup after another as
                    various factions gained or lost power. When the Baathis came that ended. Finally
                    Hafiz Al-Asad took power.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. He was commander of the air force and supported the Baath at
                    first He didn't emerge as dictator-president at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave in '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We left as the Israelis were shooting down Syrian jets just south of
                    Damascus. I had orders to succeed Ed Springer as American consul in Port Said.
                    Meanwhile, interesting things occurred in the Middle East. While we were on home
                    leave, the Six Day War occurred. We watched in on TV. That changed the
                    complexion of things not the least for American diplomatic assignments. The
                    consulate in Port Said was burned to the ground. Fortunately, Springer was a
                    canny old friend. He had our recently arrived household effects, including all
                    the kids' toys and beds and everything, moved out of the consulate's warehouse.
                    Thus we emerged from that calamitous period in Egypt with our household effects
                    totally intact. PER said, “You can either come here and walk the corridors or go
                    on TDY to USIA which is manning the American pavilion in Expo '67 in Montreal.
                    We both agreed that it would be far more fun to spend some time in Montreal
                    rather than down to DC with our two boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Relations were settled with a number of Arab countries.
                        The State Department was crawling with Arabists and others who had no
                        jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Absolutely. That's why we went to Montreal. We spent from late June
                    until October 5th Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to talk about that and then we'll close this
                        session. The precipitation of the Six Day War was Nasser demanding the UN
                        withdraw troops from the Straits of Tiran. What had happened before? Why
                        were the Israelis shooting at Syrian planes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Because the two countries were skirmishing on the cease fire line.
                    Syria was supportive of the Palestinians and Israel was seeking to seize land in
                    the Golan</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was not part of the actual war. This happened
                        while you were there before the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. The UN brokered a cease-fire between Egypt and Israel. Whether
                    that had taken effect or not, I can't remember. But in any event, the Liberty
                    was a ship sailing off the coast of Syria and Palestine/Israel trying to
                    discover what the Israelis were up to vis-a-vis Syria. What they intended was a
                    blitzkrieg. They shifted armor from Sinai north to the Golan and proceeded to
                    not only try to sink our eavesdropping ship but also to knock the stuffing out
                    of the Syrian forces that were defending the Heights. But I had left Damascus by
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had gone then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. My timing was right on. Ambassador Smythe and his staff had a
                    hellish exit from Syria when relations were broken. When I turned up next in the
                    saga, it was as a member of the U.S. interests section of the Spanish Embassy in
                    Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was handling public relations—actually a tour guide for White
                    House, USIPs, senators, House of Representatives, and an array of state
                    government officials plus assorted realtors, automobile dealers, etc. A lot of
                    interesting and nice people turned up, jumped the line, and were given a quick
                    tour of our pavilion and escorted to see other pavilions comprising the quite
                    spectacular Exposition. So I had to arrive very early in the morning and leave
                    very late at night to play tour guide for an army of visitors to Montreal. We
                    enjoyed our life in that beautiful city. We were there when De Gaulle visited
                    and ended his speech to the Qu�b�cois: “Vive le Quebec! Vive le Quebec
                    libre!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: De Gaulle was disinvited to come to Ottawa after
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I dare say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Independence with Quebec, who knows where it will be. It
                        reached a peak and now it's died down quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: But the emotional appeal is still there. That's something I learned.
                    I expect the increased emphasis on bilingualism together with the exodus of many
                    English speaking Canadians from Montreal and other cities led to the return of
                    calm. I wouldn't be surprised if over time the pressure for independence should
                    revive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop. We'll pick this up
                        in 1968. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I went to Cairo as a member of the Spanish embassy US interests

                        were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about how our interests section worked at
                        the time? Who was there? What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: There were no serious issues apart from the issue of peace in the
                    Middle East. Contacts were relatively limited. I worked closely with several
                    Egyptians, mostly with Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, Hamed El Sayegh.
                    Don Bergus, the head of the interests section, had contacts with several members
                    of the RCC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the RCC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The Revolutionary Command Council. I think the council may still
                    today be a formal part of the Egyptian governmental structure.</p>
                <p>We were nominally part of the Spanish Embassy but we functioned as a miniature
                    embassy. The Spaniards were ideal protectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We were about 6 or 7 officers plus communications and secretarial
                    staff. Don Bergus was the head of the interests section. Bill Brownell comprised
                    the political section. George Walsh was the consular section. Gordon Brown was
                    my number two in the economic/commercial section.Q: What was your job?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Economic/Commercial affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing much commercially with Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No. Cairo didn't have any money to buy anything and thus there was no
                    great effort to sell. There were a few importers of things like Kent cigarettes
                    who were doing a good business. But the rest of whatever business was going on
                    was taken care of without any intervention, involvement, or knowledge of the
                    USINT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do economically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That kind of limited business that was going on. American firms had
                    been supplying Egypt for many years; there were established relationships and
                    representation. Economically we kept track of Soviet aid programs and monitored
                    Cairo-Moscow ties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Egyptians or the United States interfere with
                        these normal transactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, not that I can recall. Phillips Petroleum was actively exploring
                    for oil in the western desert, USINT, but we didn't get involved at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the US have any sort of residual investments or
                        government to government type things that we were concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Apart from ideal currency-financed projects, not that I can
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find generally being in Egypt at that time?
                        Was there much animosity towards the US?MARTHINSEN: No. I never encountered
                        any instance or heard of any instance of animosity. As is true throughout
                        the Middle East, most Egyptians hold positive views of the United States,
                        though not of U.S. foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been the story that American planes had launched
                        the attack that wiped out the Egyptian air force in the '67 war. Was that
                        still around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That was generally accepted as true by most Egyptians and more than a
                    few non-Egyptians. After all, most of the arms that the Israelis possessed and
                    possess today were U.S.-manufactured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, at that time, '67, most of the air force was
                        French. It wasn't until after the '67 war that the great American influx of
                        arms came. Was the government contact kind of shut out to you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. The planes were French as were some Naval craft, armor and
                    artillery, I believe, were from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, did you feel you were in a holding action

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, that's a good way to put it. We were hoping for full restoration
                    of relations between the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some of the police authorities? Were they
                        following you and giving you a rough time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was not at all as intensive a surveillance as occurred in Syria.
                    No, I was never aware of being followed, neither I nor any of my colleagues was
                    ever harassed by local authorities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you observing about the role of the Soviets

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The Soviets were cocks of the walk, at least on the governmental
                    level. I don't think the Soviets made a big hit with Egyptian shopkeepers and
                    students.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They probably didn't have the money.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned that the Soviets were dominating Egypt

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, that was a common impression. Washington was very nervous about
                    the USSR's influence. We were busily competing with the Soviets at that
                    time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: He was not at all fond of our favored prot�g� in the Middle East. And
                    because any “enemy” of the Israelis would be someone on whom we would confer the
                    title “hostile,” we could restrain our enthusiasm for Nasser. But in daily life
                    in USINT and as temporary inhabitants of Cairo, we were not aware of any
                    anti-Nasserism.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The latter was the case. All realized that we had to wait until other
                    developments occurred that would permit a more extensive relationship.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was called back to the Department to become the staff assistant to

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joe Sisco was a phenomenon. How long were you working for
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: From '69 to '70.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: You had to stay alert. He is very bright, but he could be described
                    as gruff and demanding. Even so, we got along well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the relationship of Sisco with

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, I got no feel for that. Everything went along reasonably
                    smoothly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: NEA encompassed South Asia as well. Maybe he focused 2/3 on
                    Arab-Israel matters and the other 1/3 on South Asian affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Greek colonels situation intrude at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not in a serious way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the relationship between Sisco

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It was a good relationship, very close and very cooperative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were great players in the political game.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, not really. Though I was in the office all the time, he rarely
                    shared with me or anyone else what occurred in his meetings with the Secretary
                    or at the NSC or elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the term was, he played his cards very close to
                        his chest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of his operating style.</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within NEA, was there a tilt towards Israel as opposed to
                        towards the Arab world or the reverse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: A curious recollection is that IAI (Israel and Arab-Israeli Affairs)
                    was almost like a competing element within the bureau as opposed to EGYC the
                    Egyptian, Arab States North (ARN) and Arab Peninsula Affairs. I suppose that
                    reflects the clientitis which so frequently occurs in our business; a tendency
                    to adopt the key aims of the states with whom one is working. But that's about
                    it; it was containable. Personal relationships were always very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After about a year working with Sisco, where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I went to Tripoli, Libya. In September of '69, Qadhafi's coup brought
                    down the Idrisid monarchy and yet another RCC was in business. My family and I
                    arrived in early summer of '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Joseph Palmer II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Creepy. The Libyans were not sophisticated or used to dealing with
                    other powers according to international norms. Their pool of linguistically
                    talented personnel and experts in economic, political, and even military affairs
                    was small. There were a few key civilian players in the government. All Libyans,
                    whether civilians or military were suspicious of the United States for having
                    been a patron of the defunct monarchy as well as a patron of Israel. Even
                    American business interests, especially in the oil industry, were distrusted by
                    the very xenophobic RCC. It was a strange situation. The ambassador made
                    repeated efforts to reassure Qadhafi and Jalud and the other figures in the
                    Libyan RCC that we accepted the new government and harbored no ulterior motives
                    in our relationship. We wanted to have a reasonable, productive relationship
                    with the Libyans in all sectors. But it was a very hard sell; the suspicion of
                    us was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was the senior political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get out and around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, we could all get out and about. Few places were out of bounds.
                    We could travel throughout the country and did. Relations with the Libyan
                    government were limited pretty much to Qadhafi's headquarters at Aziziya
                    Barracks and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Libya's Secretary General of
                    Foreign Affairs, Mansur Al-Kikhiya, was a pivotal contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we left Wheelus Air Base by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. By the time Kate and I arrived in Tripoli, Wheelus had been
                    closed and all U.S. uniformed personnel had departed. We were still cleaning up
                    what was left in the commissary and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk to Libyans or was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We had contacts but they were limited, in part because Libyans had
                    been treated rather badly by outside ruling powers, particularly the Ottomans
                    and the Italians. Libyans lacked self-confidence and any sense of nationhood.
                    Most of our contacts were in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you interested in as a political officer, signs
                        of dissent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: The big question was what direction would Libya take. Qadhafi saw
                    himself as the son of and probably as the heir to Gamal Abdul Nasser. Shortly
                    after we arrived, in October of '70, Nasser died. The Libyans expressed feelings
                    of despair because the clarion voice of Arab nationalism had been stilled. I
                    have rarely seen such widespread outpouring of sentiment. There were processions
                    of average Libyans marching for hours through the streets of Tripoli.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations between Libya and Egypt at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: They were very good at least at the Qadhafi-Nasser levels. And there
                    was much talk of reviving the UAR. The Libyans saw themselves as virtually
                    destined to become members of an expanded United Arab Republic. There is a story
                    to be told about why it never happened. Certainly the sentiment in the street
                    was in favor. I presume it would be that the big difference would have been an
                    economic difference. If you take on the Egyptians as your countrymen, you're
                    going to have to watch your oil-rich pocket very carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It didn't work very well with the Syrians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of Egyptians came over to Syria and were not
                        welcomed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That's right. Well, they had more Egyptians than they had jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of their major exports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did Libya have people from the better educated elements of the Arab world, Egypt
                    and Palestine, staffing much of their...</p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, in particular in the education ministry and the university
                    campuses in Tripoli, and Benghazi. It was very heavily staffed by Egyptians and
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Libyan relationship with the Soviet
                        Union and the East Bloc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Well, our country then was totally fixated with the USS. Any Soviet
                    sales, appearances by delegations, any suggestion of Soviet Russian influence
                    was viewed as a setback to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of Soviet types running around
                        Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, but that probably is more a reflection of the lack of
                    self-confidence and the xenophobia which were characteristic of Libyan society,
                    particularly among the high-ranking members of the regime. Libyans were almost
                    afraid they were going to be taken to the cleaners.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about oil developments? Was this going on despite the

                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, it was.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we having trouble with the assistance, Arabic in the
                        passports and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: That brought me to one of the points of my Foreign Service career
                    that was certainly disturbing. It involved good news and bad news. Qadhafi
                    decided that Arabic was as much an international language as English, Russian,
                    Chinese, and French, and therefore all foreigners visiting or going to Libya had
                    to have their passports translated into Arabic. Initially the reaction of
                    particularly the Western countries was, “Oh, forget it. No way.” For a while,
                    that worked. And then on a weekend, he ordered that the regulation be enforced.
                    All travelers were denied entry or exit if they had passports that were not
                    translated into Arabic. Quite by coincidence, one of the members of the embassy
                    was off in Tunisia that weekend. So, he was stuck abroad. I was kind of point
                    man in seeking a solution to this particular problem. We devised several schemes
                    to try and circumvent the difficulties. We arranged for our colleague to fly to
                    France and to get on a flight to Tripoli carrying the French ambassador, who had
                    been on leave, and several French peddlers of fighter aircraft. We thought
                    surely if our colleague is arriving on the same plane (and the French had told
                    us that they weren't translating their passports into Arabic; they would do what
                    the UN required and nothing more) we could point out the difference in treatment
                    accorded the French Ambassador and his team and our colleague. And then we
                    played with that strategy a little bit and decided to delay matters until that
                    flight left; our colleague would at least be on the ground. It didn't work.
                    Finally, they got rough. I had been annoying them by pointing out these
                    discrepancies in their behavior towards the French and the American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had let the French in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, the French were admitted with no problem that we were aware of.
                    I was there with another colleague and suggested he get out of there because I
                    thought things could get nasty. Then they did. A Qadhafi relative who was the
                    head of the police at the airport and finally grew vexed with my delaying tactic
                    and said, “Okay, you're out of here. You will leave on the same plane.” I
                    pointed out that I had not intended to travel and didn't have my passport. He
                    had me put on the plane by force. Two military policemen grabbed my arms and
                    walked me onto the aircraft and into a seat on the plane. So, I called the
                    steward and said, “I think the pilot should know that if I should take off in
                    this aircraft (the next stop was Valetta, Malta), goodness knows what would
                    happen. I have no passport and would be undocumented.” The pilot said, “Forget
                    it. I can't take someone who doesn't have his documents in order.” My sole
                    satisfaction on that occasion was that I was able to descend from the aircraft
                    and look Qadhafi's relative in the eye and gesture that I was back here in
                    Tripoli.” A colleague and friend, Hal Josif, was charg�. I went in to report to
                    Hal on the developments and concluded, “I think we can expect a PNG letter
                    pretty quickly from our Libyan friends.” My recollection is that it was that
                    very same evening—it was unusual for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to act that
                    quickly—the note PNGing me arrived. I left Libya two days later. My family
                    followed later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: 1973. The good news was that I had been selected earlier to attend
                    the National War College. We had home leave and we went back for an additional 2
                    years in Tripoli. If I hadn't been PNG'd, then I couldn't have attended the War
                    College. So, as it worked out, I did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Well, war college. It was very interesting to be dealing with
                    military officers who have a rather different approach to international
                    relationships.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been a lot of attention paid to the
                        October war, the '73 war, between Israel and the Egyptians and Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. That has been so in recent history; you can always rely on the
                    Arab-Israeli dispute to enliven the scene.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out in '74. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: After the war college I went back to the Department to Personnel. I
                    was NEA assignments chief for 2 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be '74 to '76. How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: At that time a major policy thrust was to combat clientitis via the
                    GLOP. Scuttlebutt in the Department was that Secretary Kissinger had been
                    somewhere in Mexico and an FSO had said, “We” when he really meant “the
                    Mexicans.” Kissinger's concerns about clientitis was refined by Personnel into a
                    policy of assigning FSOs to geographic area outside their areas outside their
                    areas of specialization. This was, in my view, a tremendous waste of resources .
                    Officers study a language, perhaps a difficult language for a long period of
                    time. The more one is immersed in such a language, the more one becomes skilled
                    in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with women Foreign Service officers in the
                        more hostile Arab world? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It wasn't a real problem. The problem was finding an officer who had
                    the requisite language skills and professional experience to take a given
                    position. We were making great efforts to assign more and more females. So much
                    so that I can remember chatting with friends and agreeing to be a minority
                    female was the key to success in the Foreign Service. The assignments did
                    proceed and females were perhaps first assigned to Kuwait. Women had been
                    assigned previously to Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The peninsula was a different
                    kettle of fish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem in Personnel in assigning officers to
                        Israel? Did that almost preclude them from serving in Arab states later
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No. In Personnel, we often thought, why would anyone, say a Jewish
                    officer, want to serve in Saudi Arabia? Well, presumably because it's there and
                    you want to try it. So, our attitude was, “It's your funeral if you want to go.
                    God knows when you're going to run into a loony.”</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was assigned to Political-Military Affairs temporarily covering a
                    position for which another FSO had been selected but hadn't arrived. Les Gelb
                    was the PM director at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: NEA was always my home bureau and I felt most at home there. While PM
                    was pretty dynamic, it couldn't compare with NEA where, if things are calm right
                    now, don't worry; It's going to change.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Less than a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where did you go? We're moving on to '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I went back to NEA as country director for Egyptian affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be '77. That must have been an interesting
                        time. That was when things were beginning to break loose with Sadat going to

                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, they were exciting days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing that until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '80. It was an exciting time. Of course, whenever major events, such
                    as Sadat's initiative occur, business quickly escalates up to the assistant
                    secretarial level and even secretarial level. So, I was backstopping President
                    Carter's efforts to seek peace in the Middle East.</p>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, how were we initially evaluating
                        Anwar Sadat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: It's hard to separate jokes about and by Egyptians from the reality.
                    The assessment was that he was no Gamal Abdel Nasser. Certainly he was more of a
                    realist than Nasser had been. He certainly proved his mettle in the power
                    struggle with Ali Sabri in Cairo. He established himself as the president and
                    stayed in that position until he was murdered by the Muslim loonies. Anyone who
                    knew him or the people around him had to be favorably impressed. He was more
                    pragmatic and less doctrinaire than Gamal had been and certainly he opened the
                    door to peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time with Sadat going to Jerusalem, was this
                        exciting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Oh, very much so. There was a distinct possibility that there would
                    be action. People were talking about solving a problem that had been around for
                    50 years. My entire life had been spent in a field that was dominated by the
                    Arab-Israeli dispute. Anyone who had served in the area and knew something of
                    the countries involved dreamt an end to the killing and bombing and propaganda
                    could occur. We hoped that a mite of justice for the Palestinians could be
                    found. Yes, it was a very exciting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the Camp David process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I didn't go to Camp David. That was at the assistant secretary and
                    deputy assistant secretary level and the level of the Secretary himself and the
                    White House. No, they didn't have room for me at the inn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were you involved in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Backstopping, carrying position papers, evaluating proposed courses
                    of action. But the negotiations were all handled by the principals. Of course,
                    everything was top secret.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the outcome of Camp David?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: We thought that a great weight had been raised from our shoulders,
                    though that proved to be more a hope than a fact. God knows Egypt needed relief
                    from the burdens of war and preparation for war that had dominated Egyptian
                    society for so many years. And they had so much more to do. There were too many
                    Egyptians. The Nile Valley was awash with people, as it is today. They had been
                    preoccupied with the Israel struggle and by inter-Arab rivalries and alliances
                    and movements towards unity and, inescapably, facts of disunity. We hoped that
                    that was the beginning of better times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Towards the end, about 1980, did you see it still in a
                        very positive sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: So far as Egypt was concerned, yes. I think that the phased stage by
                    stage withdrawal of occupying forces from Sinai and the restoration of Egyptian
                    sovereignty served to demilitarized Sinai; that provided the basis for a real
                    relationship between Egypt and Israel. Who knows how that will work out. This is
                    one international agreement that has to be extended to include all of the
                    parties before you can say, “now the situation is under control.” As we have
                    seen, the dispute affects countries far afield, in the Arab Peninsula states, to
                    Iraq, to northern Africa, etc. Indeed not only the Arab world, but the Muslim
                    world is involved, as in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was named ambassador to Qatar. When the offer was made to me, I
                    wasted no time accepting. I recalled a remark made by Napoleon to his soldiers:
                    “Every one of you could have a baton in your knapsack.” I thought, even if it's
                    a tiny baton, it's better than none. I went through the Senate hearings and was
                    off for Doha.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Doha from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '80 to '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Doha like when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Recently I saw some literature put out by the Qatar Ministry of
                    Information featuring pictures of Doha today. When we were there, Doha was
                    modernizing, but still more picturesque. The ruler is the son of the Sheikh who
                    ruled when we were there. He has transformed Qatar. The Sheikh has developed an
                    “education city” focused on the expanded university. Women participate in
                    municipal elections. There's much talk about a parliament. All these things were
                    unknown in my day. Breathtaking developments in this tiny, but very nice,
                    country. Today one sees ads for the Sheraton Hotel on the beach, inviting
                    visitors to have a cocktail near the pool—that is a staggering change. Qatar's
                    winter sunshine offers an escape for Europeans particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, what was your impression of Sheikh
                        Khalifa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Khalifa bin Hamed was the ruler; Hamed bin Khalifa was his heir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the sheikh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I thought he was a very straightforward, an ill-educated but honest
                    man who had thrust upon him many responsibilities that ordinarily ministerial
                    colleagues could shoulder. But his ministers were all members of the ruling
                    family or were related to the family. They were rarely educated. The current
                    ruler was educated at Sandhurst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Doha? You were there from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: '80 until '83. Our interests involved oil exploration and
                    development, particularly in the Dukkan. The most interesting development that
                    came up at that time was the discovery and delimiting the outlines of what was
                    called the North Shore gas field offshore between Qatar and Iran. It is among
                    the largest natural gas fields in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time when you were there, we had this turmoil in
                        Iran, but Iran was the 300 pound gorilla to the north. We didn't have
                        relations with Iran at that time. How did the Qatar-Iranian relationship
                        work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I would say the Qataris wanted most to be noticed. They didn't want
                    any outside power meddling in their neighborhood. Like most Arabs, Qataris are
                    professional Muslims, akin to the professional Christians of our country, people
                    who see everything from a religious perspective. However, Sheikh Khalifa could
                    contain his enthusiasm for the turbaned mullahs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Qataris reached an agreement with the Iranians
                        over this natural gas field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: They had not been negotiating with the Iranians. I frankly don't know
                    whether they have reached an agreement or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they have. I've been interviewing Pat Theros, who
                        was later ambassador in rather recent years to Qatar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: They must have reached it on a businesslike basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did. It's not a contentious issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How were relations with the Saudis?</p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: At least on the surface relations were quite good. There was a sense
                    of solidarity on issues that affected the Peninsula. I think that the Qataris
                    were conscious of the fact that they were the second Wahhabi power in the world.
                    The first one was that gorilla, Saudi Arabia, right next door. So, love-hate
                    would be a bit strong. Love-distrust, love-fear possibly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any disputes while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No. There were disputes, as there had been for some time, between
                    Qatar and Bahrain over Hawar Island off the northwestern coast of Qatar. The
                    ruling family of Bahrain had originally in power in Qatar. At some juncture they
                    decided that they would take the water-rich island of Bahrain and they'd leave
                    behind the Al Thanis as their viceroys. The Bahrainis enjoyed the water and the
                    Al Thanis succeeded to the oil of Qatar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] Sharjah,
                        Fujairah, Dubai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: There too the issue of the 800 pound gorilla comes in; Saudi
                    influence was paramount. There had always been border disputes in the Peninsula,
                    whether it's the Buraimi Oasis or Asia or between the Yemens, etc. A dispute
                    over the border between and among Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE sputtered
                    along and was somehow resolved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Das island a problem at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, not a serious one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was exploring for oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Qatar Petroleum had contracts with western firms such as BP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, it was the Qatar Oil
                        Company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, Qatar Petroleum was the major player.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had been running the oil business... I was a vice
                        consul in Dhahran in '58 to '60. Qatar and the UAE and Bahrain were part of
                        our consular...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: So you made it to Doha, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Then the big deal was, they had a clock tower.
                        The clock tower was the major item in Doha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes, and still was in the time. It featured on all their postcards.
                    But now Doha boats soaring hotels and business complexes and shopping malls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major American initiatives or interests in
                        Qatar at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, not really. We kind of focused more on cultural cooperation with
                    the Qataris. A significant number of the Qatar's young men and even young women
                    were being sent the U.S. universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Iran-Iraq War started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: “A fellow Arab against a non-Arab, a Muslim against a
                    non-Muslim.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this case you're saying that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Two Muslim powers were at war. Iraq is Arab, so Qatar's sympathies
                    were with Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling of threat from Iran at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Not really, though Tehran's intentions were suspect. The war was
                    basically over the Shatt el Arab, which is a body of water between the Gulf and
                    the Tigris-Euphrates River. The dispute arose in the days when the Brits were in
                    charge in Tehran and in Baghdad and earlier. The Talveg—the center of the
                    navigation channel—is the usually accepted boundary between the two states. For
                    whatever reason, Baghdad believed that its sovereignty extended to the Iranian
                    bank of the Shatt el Arab and the Iranians, quite naturally, asserted otherwise.
                    But the dispute had been around as an issue since Hector was a pup. Iraq thought
                    that Iran had been weakened by the revolution and attacked. Qatari sympathies
                    were with their fellow Arabs. Yes, there were some passing threats. As for
                    example, when the Iranians took over and/or reasserted Iranian sovereignty over
                    two islands off the UAE, Abu Musa and Tunbs. That made the hair stand up on
                    Qatari necks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that our policy at the time that you were
                        ambassador there... This was the embassy takeover and the revolution in
                        Iran. It was so recent. Were we fully supporting Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I was instructed and did assure the Qataris that we were sympathetic
                    to the efforts of the Iraqis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any developments during the time you were
                        there, until '83... The tanker war hadn't started yet, had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: No, that was afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in '83?</hi>

                <p>MARTHINSEN: On my sunset cruise. I was chosen to be a diplomat in residence.
                    Among the campus choices dangled before me was The University of Pittsburgh. My
                    brothers and their families were in the Pittsburgh area and my sister and her
                    family lived in Erie. The idea of living in western Pennsylvania was very
                    appealing. It was only after I said I'd choose Pitt that I learned they wanted
                    me to join the faculty of Semester at Sea. Kate and I and one of our sons flew
                    to the West Coast and drove up to Seattle, where we boarded the SS Universe to
                    Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ceylon, India, Egypt, and Morocco. We ended
                    up in Florida in time to spend Christmas with Kate's parents who had retired
                    there. After a lovely holiday, we went back to Pitt where I taught Middle East
                    History and Political Science at the graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Well, by the time they got into the kind of class I was teaching,
                    they were pretty serious students. I was very impressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Just for the half a year. Then I received my final FS assignment and
                    that was to the Army War College at Carlisle, where I was named DCIA (Deputy
                    Commandant for International Affairs).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: I did that for 3 years until my retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year did you retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the officers you were dealing
                        with at the Army War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Again, because they were self-selected and then chosen for the AWC,
                    they represented the cream of the officer corps and senior civil service. I
                    think they were very good, very keenly interested in the subject matter,
                    whatever it was, and pretty gung ho.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're settled now in Carlisle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTHINSEN: Yes. When the retirement bell started ringing, Kate and I knew we
                    wanted to be on the East Coast. At the time, both our sons were living in the
                    Washington area. We knew we wanted to be close enough that we could get to them
                    easily. We checked out Charlottesville, Harrisburg, Leesburg, all the way down
                    to Ashville. We knew we didn't want to retire in Florida, and we couldn't find
                    anything that really attracted us in the Carolinas or in Virginia. By then, we
                    had lived 3 years in Carlisle and we had many friends, knew our way around, knew
                    all the restaurants, and so we agreed one day while driving home from Winchester
                    that we would stay in Carlisle. It's a pretty little town with an historic
                    district that goes back to the mid-1700s. We got a newer house. It was built in
                    1874. As all kids will do, our's moved off, one to Philadelphia and now
                    Rochester, New York, and the other to Scottsdale and now Tampa. They're the ones
                    who have to put up with our visits in season, as it were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Charles, thank you very much.</hi>
