                <p>AMBASSADOR CURTIN WINSOR, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 29, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Subject: Ambassador Winsor has been Ambassador to Costa Rica, and was a former
                    Foreign Service Officer. This interview is taking place on behalf of the
                    Association for Diplomatic Studies, and of the Foreign Affairs Oral History
                    Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, what attracted you to the Foreign Service
                        as a young man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I entered the Foreign Service in 1967, largely out of an interest in
                    foreign policy. I began my career by getting a master's degree in Latin American
                    History, and following it up with a doctorate later on while I was in the
                    Service. I had a job working as a research assistant in a small “think tank”,
                    the Special Operations Research Office at American University. The idea of
                    serving abroad and of working abroad appealed to me enormously. So I took the
                    exam—in fact, I had to take it twice. I failed the written exam the first time,
                    and I entered the Service in February 1967 just as the BALPA-2 exercise hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the balancing of officers to make sure they did
                        not concentrate in one area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: No, that was the “GLOP” thing and came later, under Henry Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: GLOP thing. Oh yes. BALPA was the . . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Balance of Payments Problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Balance of Payments Problem. Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WINSOR: We cut down on overseas assignments. So I was detailed to the U. S. Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency, in 1967. I worked there for the equivalent of
                    about one-and-a-half tours, through 1970, I did back-up papers and research for
                    the Nonproliferation Treaty and the Salt-One Agreement. I did position papers
                    for our Geneva group; I was Contract Officer for a major research effort. It was
                    a very good experience, although it had very little to do with Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being thrown into that, outside of bringing from your
                        academic background an ability to write and knowledge of foreign affairs, it
                        would seem to be rather difficult for anybody to bring themselves
                        up-to-snuff on the particular expertise of arms control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, I was in the perfect part of the agency to do it, and I educated
                    myself very well. I made some lasting friendships there. I did a tremendous
                    amount of reading. I wrote an article, in fact, on the Nonproliferation Treaty,
                    that was published in Orbis magazine, as a very young man, which was heady
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>For my next assignment in the State Department I was requested as the Special
                    Assistant or Special Projects Officer, to the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Congressional Relations, who was then David Abshire. This was during the heyday
                    of the Vietnam War. I spent the better part of a year-and-a-half, maybe a little
                    less than that, with David Abshire in that position, and got a strong dose of
                    foreign policy as opposed to foreign relations. Abshire was probably one of our
                    most effective H people, and working with him got me very interested in the
                    policy structure. The office was on the 7th floor; we dealt with 7th floor
                    people. As his Special Assistant I sat in on meetings that a junior FSO normally
                    would never see. As an FSO it was very bad for me because it spoiled me. After a
                    year-and-a-half, they asked me to take Spanish and consider going out as a vice
                    consul, ironically to Costa Rica. There's a real irony in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd say so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I thought about it and I finally came to the conclusion that I preferred
                    foreign policy to foreign relations. So I made a shift, I resigned from the
                    Foreign Service and I went to work for Senator Robert Dole, as his foreign
                    policy adviser in the Republican National Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Dole, at that time, we're talking about . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: He was Chairman of the Republican National Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1971 to 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WINSOR: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what was his International Relations responsibility at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: He was really one of the prime spokesmen, for the Nixon Administration,
                    on the Vietnam War, in the debate that was going on in the Congress. I went into
                    the Republican National Committee, but I spent much time in his Senatorial
                    office serving as a speech writer for him in the debates that were going on
                    during that period. I also did some work at the National Committee in the area
                    of minority politics, and I wrote speeches on a number of other subjects. The
                    main issue in those days, of course, was the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to return, for just a minute, when you were with
                        the Arms Control Agency, what was your impression from your particular
                        viewpoint as a junior officer there—of its effectiveness and where it was
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I became convinced that the Arms Control Agency plays a role but that
                    arms control itself is a very derivative discipline. Arms control in the
                    American experience tends to be looked at with too much emphasis on
                    technicalities and what today is called “bean counting,” and not enough emphasis
                    on political realities on the political motivations or non-motivations that can
                    lead countries to sense or to see advantage in accumulating armaments; or to see
                    advantage in stabilizing, or indeed hopefully eliminating categories of
                    armaments.</p>
                <p>My concern is that we have looked too much at the outward manifestations the
                    armaments themselves and negotiated on their relative positions, and not looked
                    at the underlying political motivations; and that this has created a problem for
                    us and an advantage for the Soviets, who are consummately political in
                    everything they look at having to do with this field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were with the Agency, again as a junior officer
                        this is 1967 to ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . about '70, did you observe this factor going at that
                        time, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, one could. I became good friends with William Foster later on, who
                    was at the time of my initial appointment—the director of the Agency. And I had
                    a chance, through personal friendships, to get a very real sense of the
                    philosophies and the underlying strategies that lay behind our arms control
                    thinking. Not just the Nonproliferation Treaty and Salt, but such other areas as
                    MBFR, and the ABM Treaty, which of course was debated during the period that I
                    was in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving over to the time you were with the H, which
                        is—for the record?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Congressional Relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressional Relations. You were there, obviously, at a
                        particularly difficult time, during the Vietnam War. How effective did you
                        find the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: For a change, at that particular point, incredibly effective. Dave
                    Abshire, I would say next to Dean Acheson, was probably the most effective
                    Congressional Relations man that they had had. This was largely because he was
                    trusted by both Rogers, who was then Secretary of State, and Henry Kissinger;
                    and was able to work with the Congress, and to, in fact, maneuver in a way that
                    his predecessors haven't been able to; because we see tremendous breakdowns in
                    recent administrations, and in that I include the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>This administration has failed to utilize its friends in Congress, and has
                    managed to antagonize its adversaries needlessly to the extent that problems
                    have been created that adversely affect the interests of the United States. The
                    Central American policy is a classic example in point, where the administration,
                    in effect, lied to the Congress—or shall we say, told partial truths to the
                    Congress—and where the resulting breakdown in credibility has, I believe,
                    adversely affected American interests; because American interests are very much
                    involved in what's happening in Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing as a Special Assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: My work was largely to represent the Assistant Secretary at departmental
                    meetings; it was to get to know staffers—key staffers—on the Hill, and work with
                    them at levels, let's say, under the levels of the principals. Let's say, Dave
                    Abshire would talk to Senator Javits, I would talk to Pete Lakeland who was
                    Senator Javits' primary foreign policy adviser. I would talk to Jon Marks, who
                    then worked for Senator Case of New Jersey. There were staff people on Capitol
                    Hill who, although not themselves powerful, were tremendously influential
                    because they tended to advise their Senators. Senators are into 15, 20 different
                    things and they tend to, as a result, listen to the advice of their special
                    staff people in these fields.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today there's been a criticism that the staff has become
                        all-powerful. Looking at it at the time that you were doing it and dealing
                        with it, in foreign relations did you find that the staff was more in an
                        advisory role, or was it sort of running with the ball?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Any staffer, even today, who thinks that he's more than an adviser is in
                    deep “doodoo”, as George Bush puts it. But, the truth of the matter is, one
                    could see the pattern developing where the staff was becoming much more
                    powerful, much more pervasive. The reason for this is that Senators, again, tend
                    to run in overload anyway. The Senate has gotten far more involved in oversight
                    of foreign policy and intelligence areas since the breakdown of trust during the
                    Vietnam period. I might say this has even gone to the House as well. And the
                    proliferation of staff, particularly experienced and technically knowledgeable
                    staff, has created an alternative power center of foreign policy thinking, on
                    the Hill.</p>
                <p>I was one of the first people, when I left the Foreign Service and went upon the
                    Hill, one of the first five Foreign Service people to resign and go to work for
                    Congress. Pete Lakeland who was an FSO went to work for Jake Javits. I believe
                    that Marks had been with the CIA, and he went to work for Case. If I thought for
                    a few minutes I could come up with several other names of people, but there were
                    very few in those days. Today there are probably 20, 30, 50 former Foreign
                    Service Officers working as staffers in the foreign policy field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw this as a way to get much closer to policy than a
                        career in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I did, and I felt that when I joined the Foreign Service I did it with a
                    mistaken notion; that was I had confused foreign policy and foreign relations.
                    Foreign policy, of course, is very heady stuff, and it's generally not the place
                    where young people realistically should aspire to cut their teeth in the foreign
                    relations area. On the other hand, I must admit that I had been spoiled. I had
                    gotten very quickly into a job that exposed me to it, which is not usually the
                    case for a junior FSO. Having had a taste of it, I must say, that I was willing
                    then to sacrifice my Foreign Service career for it, when a good alternative
                    route popped up.</p>
                <p>Now what I hadn't calculated on, of course, in my own career planning, was that
                    Richard Nixon would get into trouble and then fire Bob Dole as chairman of the
                    Republican National Committee in 1973. That necessitated my looking for honest
                    work in the private sector, as opposed to what I hoped would be a trip back into
                    government through the political route, as in fact one of my friends did
                    accomplish. Q: How, in the time between when Senator Dole let you go and you
                    became Ambassador to Costa Rica, did you keep your hand in foreign
                    relations?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, Bob Dole was relieved as chairman of the Republican National
                    Committee, I believe in the first part of 1973. He asked me to go on to his
                    personal staff at that time. I made an assessment and felt that I'd worked for
                    Bob for two-and-a-half years and I didn't see that much gain for myself in
                    another tour doing that sort of work. I went out and found a job with the
                    Washington office at the Chase Manhattan Bank, as their international man. I
                    would be doing lobbying work on international financial interests and issues.
                    I'd be doing some political risk analysis for the bank. I'd would be doing a lot
                    of work with the officers and leaders of the Chase Bank, when they came to
                    Washington and did business on the Hill and elsewhere. It turned out to have
                    been a fascinating experience and one that very heavily contributed to my own
                    knowledge and resource in the financial crisis period that we're in today. And
                    it gave me a better look at how the financial underpinnings of both the foreign
                    policy and the reality of international finance function. In a word, it was, for
                    me, a tremendous job. It was difficult, in a sense, because of some
                    personalities I had to deal with, but that was not a major problem. I stayed in
                    the job for six-and-a-half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: In 1979 David Rockefeller asked me to move out of the Washington office
                    of Chase, and to become Associate Director—of a group called The Alliance for
                    Free Enterprise. The Alliance for Free Enterprise was set-up by a combination of
                    David Rockefeller and about ten other heavyweight CEOs of large
                    corporations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chief Executive Officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Right. And then Senator Russell Long of Louisiana had urged them to set
                    up a strong and very, very technically effective organization to work for free
                    enterprise legislation within a Senate, that in the period of 1979, 1980, '81,
                    was threatening to do some very negative stuff. We set the organization up, but
                    the electorate beat us to it and turned the Senate around to the point where it
                    didn't do what we were afraid it was going to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is the election of 1980, in which Ronald Reagan
                        became President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Changed the complexion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Senate became Republican.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WINSOR: That's correct, and it changed the complexion the thrust of the Senate
                    very radically. During this period, and I might say during the '70s, I remained
                    active in terms of my foreign policy interests as a trustee of the Pan-American
                    Development Foundation. I was a director of AFRICARE; I still am a board member
                    of these boards. Because of my interests at Chase, and my Donner Foundation
                    connections, I became very much involved in Egypt and the Middle East. I made,
                    in fact, three trips to Egypt over a period of a year-and-a-half, always as a
                    guest of the Egyptian government, twice as a guest of the Ministry of Health,
                    and once as a guest of the Ministry of Defense. Working with Chase I wrote
                    several contingency papers and strategy papers having to do with petroleum
                    problems and Middle Eastern problems. As a result, when Bill Brock—then chairman
                    of the RNC (the Republican National Committee)—set-up a foreign policy task
                    force, rather than do the obvious thing where I had my doctorate, which was the
                    Latin American area, they asked me to chair the Middle East area because nobody
                    could accuse me of being either a Zionist or an Arabist?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arabist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Arabist. I was as neutral, while still being knowledgeable in the field,
                    as one could get. This, as it turned out, would lead to my doing the transition
                    on the NEA Bureau for the Reagan administration. It was a very successful
                    experience as it turned out, unlike the case with the ARA bureau, where they
                    botched it very badly. The people went in and did everything wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was a lot of blood in the corridors, as I
                        recall, during that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: On the ARA business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the ARA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: NEA went beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking about the Near-Eastern Bureau, which is
                        NEA, as opposed to ARA which is the American Republic Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: So there was a tremendous differential in the way both were treated.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if I could ask you here: since you were on the
                        transitional team, what was the problem with the transition in the American
                        Republics side? Because, I speak as a professional Foreign Service Officer
                        who had no involvement in this, except it was from all accounts a very
                        unpleasant experience, and one that still has polarized the situation.
                        Certainly in the professional corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: The problem was basically people. The two people who did the transition,
                    or were primarily responsible for it, had thoroughly despised the Foreign
                    Service, and looked at the Bureau from a purely adversarial point of view. These
                    were John Carbaugh and Pedro San Juan. I had been asked to serve on that, and
                    having—I felt that the Middle East Bureau was more than I needed to handle, and
                    that Richard Perle, who was supposed to do that with me, abandoned me after the
                    first day to do it by myself. So I opted out of being involved in the ARA
                    experience, and it's probably just as well.</p>
                <p>I feel that the breakdown was because, again, of people who had a wholly negative
                    attitude toward the Bureau. And I might add that the Bureau itself should not be
                    held blameless, for reasons that I'd like to get into later. I feel that the ARA
                    Bureau has the least amount of cohesion, loyalty, back-up, and internal
                    satisfaction with itself, of all the regional bureaus in the Department.</p>
                <p>We had a reunion—this jumps way ahead of the time-frame—we had a reunion a year
                    ago, of my Foreign Service class—the class of '67. I think it was the 77th
                    class—I forget the number. We had, in the reunion, a long discussion by those
                    who were in and those who were out—of which were the better bureaus; who would
                    stay in the Department; who was not planning to stay in the Department. It
                    turned out that none of the members of my class are looking to stay in the
                    Department more than three to four years, which I found shocking. A lot of them
                    were members—a disproportionate number of them—were in the ARA Bureau, and they
                    blamed the ARA Bureau's tendency to not listen to field reporting, and in
                    effect, to not have the sense of collegiality and comity that exists in the NEA
                    Bureau, as a major factor in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get back to that, but I think we might weave
                        that in as we move.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Anyway, the ARA Bureau was, I'd say—not only was the ARA Bureau heavy-hit
                    by two heavy-handed characters in the transition—they had left themselves wide
                    open, in effect invited the hitting that occurred, by the nature of positions
                    they had met the transition team with. So that the bad experience was not just
                    inflicted on them, it was to some extent—I'd say also invited by them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Off the record, I have avoided the ARA Bureau in the
                        career of 30 years with passion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, you and a number of other good Foreign Service Officers. And it's
                    very unfortunate because it's resulted in the Bureau, I believe, being—within
                    the Department—a weak sister bureau, which we can ill afford today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're absolutely right. How did you become appointed
                        Ambassador to Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, that grows out of my experience in the transition. While I was in
                    the transition I did NEA, then the guy who supposed to do Oceans, Environment,
                    and Science—who I notice you'd interviewed—Marion Smoak, just dropped out. And I
                    got a frantic call to do the Oceans, Environment, and Science Bureau; and that's
                    possibly one of the most complex bureaus in the Department of State. I did it
                    working with my good friend, from my previous incarnation at State, Tom
                    Pickering, who was then the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>Tom and I spent a late-nighter working with a tape recorder, and we put out what
                    I think was one of the best of all the transition reports. And I must say,
                    although I signed it, Tom should have gotten the credit for it. That's when we
                    concentrated all of the non-proliferation functions into that particular bureau,
                    from other elements of the Department and the U.S. Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This transitional time is a time when the marbles are sort
                        of all on the table, and you can do a certain amount of grabbing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: It depends on your will and the extent to which you're willing to
                    cooperate with the good people in the Department. Not necessarily partisan
                    people, but the good people who will see things as they should be. Pickering is
                    such a person, and I would say—knowing Tom and I relied on him—I let him guide
                    me in writing that transition report, which I was not qualified to write under
                    the best of circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you see this as a time to take certain functions
                        from one bureau and put it under another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Oh yes. Pickering saw it as a tremendous opportunity to capture things
                    that he knew very well. He had run the Political Military Bureau and had a
                    tremendous knowledge of a lot of the key areas. He felt that if they were to be
                    unified within the OES Bureau, it would help the function of the Bureau
                    considerably. He also egged me on to write the first report from the Reagan
                    Administration arguing against implementation of some of the minerals provisions
                    of the Law of the Sea Treaty, which was to then create quite a ruckus although
                    somebody else wrote the Legal Bureau opinion on it. I wrote the first one which
                    may have sparked it with, again, the strong input of Tom Pickering.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, Tom Pickering is presently Ambassador to
                        Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: And I believe one of the finest career Foreign Service Officers around.
                    On top of that he's a personal friend. That's, I believe, one of the keys to
                    making this sort of thing work well. I viewed the NEA Bureau from not only
                    personal friendships—it turned out three or four of my classmates from the
                    Foreign Service were in it, including Wat Cluverius up at the executive area,
                    who was very helpful—but I got along very well with the outgoing Assistant
                    Secretary Saunders. The result was, I think a singularly successful transition
                    report for that bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then why Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Long story. Shortly before the transition I made a quick trip out to the
                    Middle East as an emissary of President Reagan. They asked me to take a major
                    European embassy, one where I did not have the language, or the interest, or the
                    experience, but where they wanted a “Reagan loyalist.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which embassy was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I don't feel that I should say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, no problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Because it was not a matter of record, and the Ambassador who's been out
                    there has done a superb job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: But suffice it to say that, between that and one of my companies having
                    tremendous problems—after I had left Chase—I had invested in coal just at the
                    point where the coal industry turned and began to dive—and I found myself
                    looking at a Chapter 11 situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chapter 11 being a bankruptcy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Reorganization, bankruptcy. I had to turn that embassy down, much to the
                    rage of my former colleagues. And, in fact, they offered me two—three at the
                    time, including a very prestigious Middle East embassy. So I had to go back and
                    lick my wounds in the business field for about a year-and-a-half. However, in
                    later 1982, I wrote a sarcastic note to one of my roommates during the
                    transition, Bud McFarlane, about our Central American policy, which I felt was
                    making no sense at all. McFarlane responded with an angry phone call suggesting
                    I put my life where my mouth was. He suggested that I be considered for the
                    embassy in Costa Rica. This was in late '82.</p>
                <p>My appointment was resisted stoutly by the careerists in ARA, but I finally
                    prevailed and went out in July of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could the careerists resist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: By putting up arguments, by delaying tactics, by putting up their own
                    people, by—frankly, I don't—one doesn't know. I just know that I was—my name was
                    moved forward in September of 1982, and I didn't go to post until July of
                    '83.</p>
                <p>I didn't rush out to post because I wanted to spent an extra month to perfect my
                    Spanish language. I had survival Spanish, but I wanted to be sure I went out
                    with at least 3/3 Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 3/3 being the State Department fluency grading.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: For which I'm very glad. The Department did a tremendous job. FSI
                    (Foreign Service Institute) did a tremendous job of preparing me for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you went out there—let's take several things.
                        What ideas did you have that you— at the time, not today, but at the
                        time—what did you see that would be your major job? Then we'll come to
                        instructions and all. But let's say, what ideas you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I went out with a rather unique preparation for a United States
                    ambassador, and indeed that was in, I think, both McFarlane and Bill Clark, and
                    several of my friends . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McFarlane, by the way, was at that time . . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Deputy at the NSC . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Security Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Bill Clark was then the National Security Adviser. I had a unique
                    combination of business experience, mixed. I had a background in international
                    banking with six years at Chase, and they were sending me to a country that was
                    the bellwether regional democracy and in terrible economic trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All its debts were coming home at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: That's right. The country was functionally bankrupt. I went out, really,
                    with as much an economic mission as a political mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of instructions did you get before you went
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: They did not give me any instructions when I went out. At that point we
                    were generally following what I considered to be the disastrous—the unthought
                    out—two track policy, which has us wanting to negotiate with the Sandinistas, on
                    the one hand, and to hit them with a weak stick if they don't negotiate, on the
                    other. That's the idea of negotiating Communists into becoming good
                    democrats—Tom Enders' masterpiece—then sending a group of non-politically
                    rooted, CIA controlled, commandoes to blow up bridges if they don't do it. I
                    consider that to be one of the dumbest policies the United States government has
                    ever pursued, or at least since Vietnam. It's a lose, lose proposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out, who was the head of ARA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Enders was just going out . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thomas Enders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: . . . and Motley was just coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Thomas Enders was a Foreign Service Officer . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: He was a Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . and Motley had been Ambassador to Brazil at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Correct. He was a political appointee, Ambassador to Brazil.</p>
                <p>I came in then, basically, with the idea primarily of helping Costa Rica get its
                    economic house in order. We had a very strong AID mission, we had a huge AID
                    program; however, for all of that, the country was having no luck in getting its
                    debts arranged or set-up in such a way that they could pay them with the
                    commercial banks. It was in disarray with the IMF (International Monetary Fund).
                    It was not even talking to the World Bank, which required certain trade-related
                    concessions from them. In a word, the country was in bad shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any, sort of ammunition, to take with you
                        on the economics set-up. Often it is said, that a political ambassador can
                        bring something that a professional officer can't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: He can bring it, but not from the Department. I received nothing from the
                    Department in that sense at all, except for trouble, my entire period there.</p>
                <p>What I did bring was—being a political ambassador, and an articulate one who
                    spoke Spanish—the Costa Ricans perceived that I had more clout than my
                    predecessor, who was a careerist. I became—because of my willingness to be
                    outspoken, through the point of view of the Costa Ricans—a spokesman not for the
                    Department of State but for the White House, as they saw it. And this gave me
                    tremendously more effective input than I would have had if I had just been a
                    quiet Department of State ambassador. For me the high profile was very
                    successful in Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>The problem that I faced was how to get an incredible tangle untangled. I had one
                    major factor to play with, and that was a huge AID program, and a very, very
                    good AID director—who has since, by the way, had a lot of unjust opprobrium laid
                    on him by an IG's (inspector general) report that was politically inspired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the AID director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Daniel Chaij. And interestingly, both Frank McNeil, myself, and Lew
                    Tambs, who were as politically disparate as any three men could be, have risen
                    to his defense.</p>
                <p>But, the key was, early on, to sit down with the government of Costa Rica and
                    start talking about quiet conditionality—nothing written down—but
                    understandings. We would do such and such if they would do such and such with so
                    and so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could describe their problem and a little
                        bit of how they got into it, as you saw it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: How they got into their mess? It was rather simple. They borrowed a lot
                    of money for nonproductive uses—public sector uses—at a time when the commercial
                    banks were throwing money out their windows, to recycle the so-called
                    “petrodollar debt”—or “petrodollar problem,” influx, glut. The big banks could
                    not imagine that there would be anything but a strong OPEC cartel in charge of
                    the oil price scene, through the millennium. So they felt it was their duty, and
                    indeed their duty to their shareholders, to recycle as much of this money, as
                    loans on which they could get as good a spread, as they could; because they
                    didn't see how they would lose, because this money would always be available
                    from the OPEC recycling. This led them to make loans to Costa Rica, to Brazil,
                    to Mexico, to Argentina, which they never would have made if they had been using
                    their own conventional, high-cost money.</p>
                <p>Well, a funny think happened in 1979, 1980. The petrodollar loans dried up.
                    Petrodollar flow dried up as the West economized and as the OPEC and
                    oil-producing countries got greedy and flooded the market. The petrodollar
                    overhang disappeared overnight, like mist on the mountain. The banks were left
                    holding an awful mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Costa Rica being one of the smaller ones actually, although the Costa
                    Ricans have a horrendous debt, relative to their gross domestic product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did they turn to the United States as the source of
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, they figured that since they were the United States' great exemplar
                    of democracy, that they were owed assistance. And indeed, we responded very
                    nicely; we gave them a huge AID program, made up from ESF—Emergency—well, it's
                    funding, it's cash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, we gave them cash to help them out of
                        their debt problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Which then, in effect, kept the bubble of their standard of living up,
                    through a steady influx of U.S. cash to subsidize them. As a Reagan appointee,
                    as a conservative who believes that political democracy requires free economies
                    as a topsoil in which to grow, I was horrified with what I saw in Costa
                    Rica.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>There was a nationalized banking system that was not working well. Sixty percent
                    of the economy was in the hands of government. Government was actively
                    interfering with free trade patterns. They were doing, as I saw it, a lot of
                    things very wrong, given the climate of the world today. And I might add, by the
                    way, that the crash in Costa Rica was caused not only by the drying up of the
                    loan money—the easy loan money—but by the collapse of all—and this is not just
                    Costa Rica—but all of their traditional exports.</p>
                <p>Countries in Africa began to export coffee and Brazil expanded its production, so
                    the coffee market collapsed just as the OPEC oil collapsed. And on top of that,
                    sugar collapsed; meat prices collapsed; and banana prices collapsed. So the
                    Costa Ricans were just in terrible shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All this also represented a dietary change in some of the
                        major markets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: In the U.S. there was less red meat eaten, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sugar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: And most of the beef goes to McDonalds and the fast-food chains. Sugar
                    has come off a bit. Of course that was always a scandalous mess, and still is at
                    best, anyway. Bananas were going through a cyclical down trough. So at that
                    particular point, the Costa Ricans were desperately talking about new,
                    nontraditional exports. And that became one of the major thrusts of our AID
                    program, to help them get into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you say the AID program . . . Before we go to the
                        AID program . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: It's a pretty complex web.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is, but fascinating. When you went out there, how did
                        you find the embassy staff? I mean, as an effective instrument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I found that I had a disaster for an Economic Officer; I had a guy who
                    was a functional illiterate a FSO-1 in economics. So I had to work around him. I
                    won't mention his name, but believe it or not he's still in the Service as an
                    FSO-1, and doing economic work. But, I had to ask my AID mission to do the
                    economic reporting, and a junior officer who was fairly good to do the
                    Department of State inter-face.I found that my Foreign Service Contingent was
                    somewhat understaffed. I would say I could have used either one junior and one
                    mid-level FSO—to do the work that was required. They were understaffed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your DCM? Were you supported by him, or
                        her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: My DCM was a problem, and it would be a problem I would say that
                    contributed to my early departure from Costa Rica. That was my own fault for
                    reasons I'll get into later.</p>
                <p>On the whole, though, my relationship with the Foreign Service people and even
                    with certain levels of people in ARA was good; because, as a former FSO, I found
                    that there was a collegiality extended to me that was not extended to a lot of
                    the other political appointees. I had not been involved in the bad side—the dark
                    side of the transition team, and that too was favorably remembered.</p>
                <p>My problems were to come from my objection to the “two-track” policy, and
                    resulting political fights with Tony Motley over that. And one real clash with
                    Motley and the ARA Bureau over my withholding aid when we were at the key point
                    of getting the Costa Ricans to do what they needed to do to get the banks on
                    line, the IMF on line, and the World Bank on line. Because what we created was a
                    cascading conditionality where we got the Costa Ricans to agree to do what the
                    World Bank wanted, with what the IMF wanted, and with what the commercial banks
                    wanted, and then with what we wanted. And we coordinated the whole thing so that
                    they got a loan package that did what they had to have done. And they in turn
                    did what was necessary to make what all of us wanted to see done, work. In other
                    words, to get the economy functioning again in the private sector, to get
                    nontraditional exports up, and to get them to the point where they could begin
                    to repay the loans that were being advanced to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to work with—drawing on your experience with
                        Chase—with the banks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes. I was the first American ambassador I think in history, at least so
                    they told me, to sit in on steering committee meetings with the commercial
                    banks, for the country, and actually to turn the steering committee around and
                    get them to agree to give Costa Rica a breather on loan interest rates, and
                    indeed to give them an additional $75,000,000 in monies. And this was done
                    because we had the IMF on board, and the Costa Ricans on board with the IMF, to
                    agree to changes in the technical management of the Costa Rican economy. We had
                    the World Bank on board in terms of the Costa Ricans agreeing to freeing up
                    their trade patterns, so that, again, the non-traditional exports and marketing
                    strategies that were needed to make the Costa Ricans competitive again would
                    work. And our main AID quiet conditionality was that they begin to open up the
                    banking sector to, again, to non-government credit suppliers; which we saw as
                    being absolutely crucial to the economy beginning to grow again. And that's what
                    the fight erupted over.</p>

                        solid economic support, and that the Foreign Service couldn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Because basically I had a—the guy was a dead head. My senior FSO Economic
                    Officer was incompetent as the Chief of the Economic Sect. Everybody agreed, but
                    it took me six months to get rid of him. I finally then went up and recruited a
                    superb Economic Officer in Bonnie Lincoln, who's still at the embassy, who
                    turned that situation around very quickly. But I had to put up with eight
                    months, functionally, of having nobody in my key economic slot, in an
                    understaffed Foreign Service mission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you saw this as being the key section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, it was one of two key sections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, that's right. And I had to use a very good writer in the AID mission
                    to do my economic reporting work, a fellow who just died of cancer last year
                    named Owen Lustig. Owen—working with a junior FSO—worked around this guy, who
                    was hopeless. Yet he's still in the Service I understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the support you got from the State
                        Department for this type of restructuring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: None. Because it was alien to the Department's thinking, and I ended up
                    in a terrible fight with the Department, particularly over my conditionality on
                    opening up the banking system. The Costa Rican left screamed, and a fight broke
                    out because the President of the country, with whom I had my informal deal, had
                    gone to Europe for about a month to try to convince the Europeans that the
                    Sandinistas were bad guys and the Costa Ricans were good guys. And in that
                    period, elements of the left attempted to double-cross me on the conditionality
                    we had agreed to with the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop here for a second; let's switch over. [Tape
                        interrupted] How competent did you find the Costa Rican side, on the
                        economic side, bankers, economists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Very competent. They were very well prepared. The Costa Ricans, I would
                    say, had a team of very, very good people. The problems we ran into, however,
                    were not the technocrats. They were the politicians. The left-wing of the
                    Partido de Liberacion Nacional—which is the European Socialist type party that
                    was the government party at that point in Costa Rica—had nationalized banking as
                    one of their sacred cows. And they saw me, correctly, as attempting to undermine
                    them.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I saw U.S. aid—all $300,000,000 bucks worth of it at that
                    point, a year—going down a rat hole, if the credit sector would not support what
                    we were trying to rebuild. This was an export economy which would require a
                    certain amount of credit flexibility, as opposed to political flexibility, in
                    dealing with the investors who were going to put together the export products,
                    which were going to be mainly agricultural and in some cases commercial. So the
                    battle grew over that. It was called the Ley de Moneda, which was put forward by
                    the government itself ironically, and would have, in fact, opened the money law.
                    Ley de la Moneda. “The law of the money,” would be the literal translation.
                    There was a terrible fight over it within the PLN, which controlled the
                    congress, because some of the most left-wing elements were aware of our deal and
                    were supporting us because they were decent people. Some of the slimier elements
                    in the country were attempting to block it because they did not, for their own
                    reasons, want that to go through.</p>
                <p>I ended up withholding aid—something no ambassador had done in Costa Rica—for a
                    month. To the point where, literally, the country was on the brink of problems.
                    And the resulting battle forced me, in fact, to have to take a position of
                    disobeying instructions from the Department of State to disburse the aid.</p>
                <p>Motley and the ARA Bureau, looking at the uproar over my nondisbursal and getting
                    uninformed assurances from Europe—from Monge, the President—ordered me to
                    disburse it, at a point where if I had disbursed it I would have lost
                    credibility and our deal with the international financial institutions wouldn't
                    have worked. I refused to disburse it, and I stood on that position for about
                    two weeks. The only person in Washington who supported me, and who turned it
                    around for me, was Pete McPherson, administrator of AID, because his AID mission
                    had been keeping him personally briefed and he interceded with Secretary of
                    State Shultz. And in fact, Shultz then did turn the pressure off me.</p>
                <p>Secretary Shultz, by the way, alluded to this in his speech at Pete McPherson's
                    retirement as being an example of Pete McPherson's courage and ability, when in
                    fact the courage and the stake was on my head. Because, I was in effect,
                    standing for the credibility of the U.S. government, against the Department of
                    State which was backing a statist cave in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you received instructions and what did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WINSOR: I said that, “It is my position, and the position of the country team,
                    absolutely unanimously, that we cannot do this and retain credibility.” I
                    refused to disburse the funds. The cables, of course, were signed by Shultz, but
                    were written by Motley and the ARA people. And at that point, fortunately for
                    me, I think, I got some friends of mine from the White House to get into the
                    picture or I would have lost my head then and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask, how did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, the White House people initially saved my scalp. Then Pete
                    McPherson moved in and . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Director of AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, he was the Administrator of AID. And he reasoned with George Shultz,
                    who is not a slouch on economic matters. And Secretary Shultz realized that the
                    Department had, in effect, been giving me the wrong instructions, and backed
                    off. Right about that time, the President arrived back in the country, saw what
                    was going on, and pulled what is still known in Costa Rica as the “Mongazo.” He
                    fired half his government, including the ones who were giving us a problem. He
                    called me over to the Presidential Palace, gave me a great public abrazzo for
                    having done a public service. The aid was released and everything went well.</p>
                <p>But it was an adventure and a half, and a interesting example of dysfunction by
                    the ARA Bureau, which failed to note the economic arguments in their anxiousness
                    to placate the leftist political status quo in Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking before this interview began about the
                        problem within the State Department, about the dysfunction, as you say,
                        between economic and political. I wonder if you'd care to talk a little
                        about how you saw it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, I see it kept going to people. The Department lacks enough good
                    people with thorough economic training, and who look at politics from an
                    economic point of view. I believe that you can have no democracy without a free
                    economy. What avails you, if you can vote four times a year, or once every four
                    years, and your freedom of choice in terms of what you do in the economy which
                    affects your everyday liberty is curtailed to the point where it's to be
                    meaningless. This is, how do you say, an overstated point but the point
                    nevertheless is valid. The United States has, in my view, tended to dote over
                    free elections, and perhaps freedom of speech. But we do not, I believe, and I
                    think the Department of State is where this omission exists, give equal
                    attention to the question of whether a person can exercise their freedom in the
                    marketplace. Whether a person can get credit without having to bow to government
                    requirements, and government credit rationing; whether a person can sell their
                    produce for what it's worth as opposed to what the government says it's worth.
                    This is a fundamental issue and I believe an area in which the Department of
                    State has not come to grips with political reality, partly because it is badly
                    understaffed and badly under-represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But does this sort of reflect the United States, the
                        media, the political system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: No, I can't blame the media in that at all. I think it's purely an
                    internal aberration of the Department of State, which is looking at politics in
                    too narrow a band. The light band of politics has got to include the economic
                    dimension to a far greater extent than it does. And that's one of the reasons
                    why you see such idiocy as giving GSP [General Sales Preference], and tax
                    preferences to countries like Romania. It is a huge blind spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the political situation in Costa
                        Rica when you came there, and some of the personalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Costa Rica is as stable as the United States is politically. It runs on a
                    two party system. Both parties now have been more or less institutionalized. The
                    political spectrum is considerably to the left of the United States, in Costa
                    Rica, and up to a point that's okay.</p>
                <p>Where I had my big fight was when I was trying to open it back up to the point
                    where at least some market forces were playing in the area of credit. Because if
                    you have credit frozen politically, the potential for not only mischief but for
                    non-development is enormous. And we were investing $300,000,000 a year in the
                    development of the Costa Rican economy, and I saw the non-functioning of the
                    credit area as being the fatal bottleneck to that. So that's why the tremendous
                    fight.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>If I had lost that fight all of my efforts would have fallen apart. The
                    conditionality that the IMF wanted would have had no meaning, because the IMF
                    wanted this credit loosening just as much as we did. The same with the World
                    Bank; we would have lost a $500,000,000 package, of which the aid
                    allocation—actually it was more than that, it was a $900,000,000—package of
                    which the aid allocation was only a part.</p>
                <p>We were picked to do, for our conditionality, the bank issue, where the IMF
                    picked the trade issue—or the World Bank picked the trade issue—the IMF picked
                    the bureaucratic issues, and the commercial banks went with the whole package.
                    They then rolled over and accepted a reduced pay out and gave the Costa Ricans
                    an additional allocation of $75,000,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So while you were there this package was put
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: We put Humpty Dumpty together, and it stayed together until literally a
                    couple months after I left. Then again, the same people who we had to beat down
                    in the Ley de Moneda fight undermined our conditionality and, let's say, the
                    coalition fell apart because the chap—who was George Jones, the DCM—was not
                    willing to fight it.</p>
                <p>My successor, Lew Tambs, also did not look at things economically and I would say
                    the Costa Rican situation lapsed into a crisis that is now very serious again.
                    The new ambassador there, Dean Hinton, is an excellent career FSO, one of the
                    very few career FSOs who thinks in economic terms and I believe that he will do
                    what I did. In other words, I think he will get the economic thing back on
                    track. I have every confidence he will.</p>
                <p>But it's been a dangerous lapse, and the lapse itself again speaks of the
                    unevenness in the Department of State's or at least the ARA Bureau's
                    capabilities in this field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political leadership, when you were there, was . . .
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Luis Alberto Monge had been elected President in 1982. He was a labor
                    leader and a lot of people were very afraid of him, but he turned out to be a
                    staunch democrat and anticommunist. He recognized the spot Costa Rica was in,
                    and that Costa Rica had to become more productive in order to maintain its
                    highly developed social program. So he was willing to tradeoff some of the—what
                    he himself would privately admit were out of control programs of the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Such as, for example, the organization of parastatal industries, called
                    Codesa, which accounted for 50% of the public sector deficit every year and only
                    employed 1.7% of the work force. One of my final contributions, before Motley
                    got me, was to get from the AID mission and my friends in the PLN government—all
                    my socialist friends—an agreement to abolish that and to, in effect sell off all
                    the parastatal enterprises. And it went through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of thing were these enterprises doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, they owned a cement plant which was one-third as efficient as the
                    private sector cement plant. They owned an aluminum factory which was totally
                    nonfunctional because it had been based, again, on pre-OPEC concepts of fuel,
                    but which was fully employed or fully staffed and was a total drain on the
                    economy. They included a vast number of smaller enterprises, all of which had
                    been failed enterprises that had been bought in by the state rather than let
                    them go bankrupt. And I saw this as a great bloated sump taking all of the
                    assets out of the economy of Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>The President and the man who is now the Vice President, in fact Oscar Arias
                    himself, fully agrees with this position. I put together the program for
                    reducing and eliminating it and signed it just before I departed. I consider
                    that to be my greatest gift to Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is Costa Rica so different from the other countries? I
                        mean, you say it's as stable as the United States, politically, yet it's
                        surrounded by some of the most venal, militaristic, elitist
                        governments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Oh, you can use a lot of other adjectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can use any adjective you want and they all
                        apply.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: It's fairly simple to explain; and as a Latin American scholar, it's very
                    inviting. Costa Rica's the only country in Latin America, really—not just
                    Central America—that evolved very much as the American colonies did, or the
                    majority of them. They had no Indians to enslave, to speak of. It was sort of an
                    underpopulated area, from the point of view of the Indian peoples, at the time
                    of the Spanish exploration. It was not rich in minerals, in spite of its name.
                    The name came from the fact that Columbus noticed gold pieces that were worn by
                    the chiefs. These things had been inherited and largely imported from elsewhere.
                    It was a country that was only fit for agriculture, and small agriculture at
                    that, because it was quite hilly.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So the result was the settlers of Costa Rica came largely from Galicia [Spain].
                    They were small farmers. They settled in the higher central valley area. They,
                    like the colonists in New England, came together with and in effect managed
                    themselves. They developed a history of self-government. In the late or mid-19th
                    century, coffee came in and it allowed people who owned modest amounts of land
                    to make a reasonable income.</p>
                <p>The result was that the country developed a strong middle class. With the
                    development of the middle class came a tremendous topsoil for the country's
                    democracy. The country had its share of strongmen and dictators, but they were
                    never out of line because they never had the prodigious wealth to expend, and
                    they were at the mercy of the populace; because they did not have big armies or
                    the wealth to create big armies.</p>
                <p>The result was that Costa Rica evolved into a true Hispanic democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that we treated Costa Rica in a different
                        manner than we do the other countries? Because I'm thinking here's a
                        democracy and one can upset a democracy whereas you can ride a little bit
                        tougher with a country that has a military dictatorship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, to some extent that's true. Yes, we did treat them a little
                    differently. I always jokingly referred to Costa Rica as the Vestal Virgin of
                    Latin America for that reason. But on the other hand, I think that doesn't mean
                    you don't have thieves in Costa Rica, too, who would like to abuse the aid that
                    we give them—or for that matter their own people.</p>
                <p>You have a former President of Costa Rica right now who is a drug lord, who is
                    the godfather of all the drug activity in the country. I can't say his name or
                    I'd get my tail sued, because we only knew it through illegal but still very
                    convincing means.</p>
                <p>But Costa Rica has enormous problems. But it does have a history of true
                    democracy that is flawed, in my view, only by the abuses of government that has
                    become too perversive in its economy. We have changed that a bit, and I think
                    that Oscar Arias is following very much in Monge's footsteps, in terms of what
                    he's doing for the economy. He's privatizing it to the point not where you lose
                    the social justice and the safety net but we lose the really bloated,
                    inefficiency and thievery that had been occurring at the level of the parastatal
                    enterprises and at the level of government bureaucracy at the extent of service.
                    Mexico, of course, is the ultimate example of where you have a country evolve
                    into a true kleptocracy, as one of my friends calls it. Costa Rica could evolve
                    into a kleptocracy very easily. And that is the great danger to the country,
                    particularly with the narco-traffickers being in there to the extent that they
                    are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble with corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Not overly. There is venality in Costa Rica, especially through this one
                    former President, who's Vice President of the Socialist International and fairly
                    well known. But, I would say that Costa Rican corruption was within manageable
                    bounds while I was there.</p>
                <p>Now, I've heard that it's gotten worse, but again, I don't believe that you have
                    anything like the kleptocracy that you have in Mexico. And I think one has to
                    make certain cultural—at the risk of sounding more righteous than I feel—you
                    have to make certain cultural allowances for that kind of thing. But, having
                    said that, I would say also that because it is a rather egalitarian democracy
                    and the Costa Rican people don't put up with corruption beyond a certain point.
                    They have a vigilant media and they're fully prepared to ride a would-be Lopez
                    Portillo [former President of Mexico] out of town on a rail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving, again, to a different field, what were your
                        relations with our military attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: We didn't have a military attach� in Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: We had what we call an Office of Defense Cooperation, because Costa Rica
                    had no military. Although they have, in effect, a civil guard or militia. We
                    did, in fact, try to help them built up a capacity to protect themselves,
                    particularly from the point of view of the Nicaraguans on the border, and
                    dealing with the ever-rising flood of narco-trafficking.</p>
                <p>This led me to bring in the idea of a semi—they use the term elite, but very
                    advisedly, within the Costa Rican's function these would be trained as opposed
                    to the presently, relatively untrained Costa Rican draftees who served in the
                    Guardia Civil and Guardia Rural. We trained about 800 of them in techniques that
                    would enable them to preserve and hold the border short of an outright attack by
                    the Sandinistas. There's an awful lot of Sandinista incursions, Sandinista abuse
                    of the border area.</p>
                <p>Then Oscar Arias was elected, and when I was not in there, that was discarded and
                    the Costa Ricans have gone back, probably, to a weaker posture than they had
                    before. We also tried to develop an intelligence net for the Costa Ricans. We
                    trained 30 college graduates, young people, to become intelligence evaluators,
                    arguing and the argument being accepted, then by Arias and by his opponent as
                    well as the government that a disarmed country ought to at least know what's
                    going on. Well, they've abolished that as well. So they really are disarmed now,
                    both from the point of view of intelligence and the border. Those were my two
                    principal thrusts in the defense and intelligence areas; and I have to regard
                    those as having failed.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The third area was to try to get the [U.S.] National Guard into the country to do
                    some roadwork that I couldn't get done with my aid budget. They're now building
                    roads in Panama—or they have built roads in Panama, and in Honduras. I wanted to
                    get them in to build some roads in the northern zone of Costa Rica, which is
                    relatively undeveloped, which would help get some of the tremendous rich land up
                    there opened to the Costa Rican marketplace, and more important, the export
                    marketplace.</p>
                <p>Well, this raised hell with the leftist politicians, who saw the U.S. Army people
                    building roads as being a U.S. threat through Costa Rica to the Sandinistas. And
                    it became quite a cause celebre and I lost, although I gather shortly after I
                    left, the Costa Ricans allowed the U.S. military to build a very badly needed
                    road in the south of the country. I saw this as being a tool for development,
                    and given my own feelings about Nicaragua, a signal to Nicaragua. My only regret
                    was that it didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we move then to the Nicaraguan threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we're speaking about the 1983 to '85 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you perceive it at that time, and what were we
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: What we were doing, and what we are still doing, is a wrong strategy. We
                    viewed the Sandinistas as people who would be willing to negotiate, and we felt
                    that we would force them to negotiate using the Contras as a fully CIA
                    controlled commando.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Contras—you might explain for the record.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: The Contras are the Nicaragua resistance, which had their history
                    originally as disaffected members of the Sandinista Armed Forces, some relic
                    elements of the Somoza National Guard, and a whole bunch of campesinos who'd
                    been driven off their land by the policies of the Sandinista government.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The Sandinistas take all of the campesinos' production, give them a ration card,
                    and only honor the ration card if the campesinos give their sons and their
                    allegiance to the government, and give up going to church. When they don't obey
                    all those functions they can be, in effect, starved, because they've had to give
                    up their food. If they don't give up their food, they get shot, and their wives
                    get raped, and it's very unpleasant. That's why you have approximately 1/8th,
                    1/9th of the population of Nicaragua right now in exile, or as refugees.</p>
                <p>Anyway, these people were being used by the U.S.—the CIA— as a stick to
                    supposedly force the Sandinistas to negotiate and become good democrats, which
                    they promised to become in 1979, when the OAS recognized them, instead of
                    Somoza, as the legitimate government of Nicaragua. This was the conditionality
                    for such recognition, and nobody has held them to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was our role in Costa Rica at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: It was very secret, but at that point we were helping one of the Contra
                    leaders, Eden Pastora, who was it turned out, singularly ineffective. The man is
                    tremendous in front of the press, but as a guerrilla he lived up to his name,
                    Comandante Zero. I found that singularly appropriate for him. He did nothing
                    effective as a guerrilla whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, again—this is unclassified—was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: It's out now, but at the time, of course, this was all very sensitive.
                    But, Pastora—unlike the poor Contras in the north, who had no political root—had
                    a political root. He had been part of the governing Sandinista body. His
                    political element, headed by Alfonso Robelo, had claimed the real legitimacy of
                    the Sandinista revolution. Robelo had been on the original junta, and had been
                    one of the original leaders of the revolutions. So he had an organic claim to
                    the Sandinista revolution himself. And indeed, it has always been Pastora's
                    point that the Sandinistas have no right to call themselves Sandinistas because
                    Sandinista was a nationalist and an anticommunist. He threw Farabundo Marti, the
                    Salvadoran representative of the Comintern, out of his movement. And although he
                    took some aid from the Comintern, for a few months, he then saw what it meant
                    and stopped taking it well before he was killed.</p>
                <p>Those of us who follow Nicaraguan history, find the Sandinistas' sanctification
                    of Sandino a bit ironic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the threat of Nicaragua to Costa Rica at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Basically, the threat or the nature of the problem was constant border
                    incursions, a growing refugee problem which is now huge in Costa Rica. There are
                    250,000 refugees in the country, which are straining its social net, and its
                    medical and educational systems. But more importantly, they were threatening
                    Costa Rica politically, and in the labor area.</p>
                <p>Communist labor unions are really “sleeper” agents. The communists will move into
                    a union, they'll run it honestly which often free labor won't and then when it
                    becomes expedient, they will blow the union up if it would bring down the
                    government or serve one of their objectives. And they did such a thing in Costa
                    Rica in early 1984, when they forced a strike at the great banana plantation of
                    United Brands in Gulfito.</p>
                <p>The Gulfito plantation had been relatively marginal, because of the high cost of
                    labor. And by, in effect, pulling off the strike, they both forced and enabled
                    United Brands to shut it down. This denied the government $35,000,000 a year in
                    tax revenues, it put 5,700 people out of jobs, and it was meant to create a
                    crisis that would destabilize Costa Rica. We were able to avert that, but it was
                    a classic example of how, in effect, terrorism can be used in unconventional
                    ways.</p>
                <p>Terrorism is not just bombs, it can be the abuse of social institutions in such a
                    way to manipulate instability and to create uncertainty, just as effectively as
                    a bomb in a supermarket would do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we aware of this as this progressed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Oh, you're right we were. Certainly we were aware of it. It was the core
                    of our reporting from the embassy, for two months. I was very much involved in
                    the attempt to maintain the productivity of the land, and to avoid a total
                    disaster for the Costa Rican government. We did help them, I believe, do a
                    transition, but whatever occurred—at least 4,000 jobs were lost on the net,
                    that, and in a small country like Costa Rica that's an enormous blow.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica's population is 2.4 million—or it was at that time. Four thousand jobs
                    in a population of that would be the equivalent in the United States to 50,000,
                    60,000 jobs; that would be—in the U.S.—a heavy blow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this type of confrontation with—both internally and
                        externally—how did you perceive the role—how well were you supported by the
                        CIA? Again, I'm keeping this as an unclassified paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WINSOR: My CIA station initially was not very good because it was geared more to
                    working with the Contras than with working on Costa Rica. I complained
                    vigorously about this, and by mid-1984 I'd gotten the thing turned around so
                    that it both did the Contras—and it also served internal needs. Because I wasn't
                    so much worried about—I was a little bit worried about subversion with Gulfito,
                    the banana plantation activity—but I was also concerned because Costa Rica had,
                    at that time, paramilitary groups growing out of the increased tension, which
                    happens in Costa Rica from time to time, from both the left and the right.</p>
                <p>The communists had a thing called the Mora-Canas Brigade, which at any one time
                    keeps 500 Costa Rican communists in Nicaragua, usually fighting with the EPS,
                    and then returns them and rotates them into Costa Rica. But they come into Costa
                    Rica, secretly, and they keep their automatic weapons and their training. I felt
                    that, given the weakness of the Costa Rican military, this was something which
                    required a much more sophisticated eye on our part than we were giving it. And
                    ultimately, obviously, this was agreed to. And it led to the attempt to shore up
                    the border patrol, and to develop the intelligence net, which Oscar Arias let
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that the CIA was sort of running its
                        own show without coordinating with you, or did you feel that you were in

                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: No. While I was ambassador there was a great deal of coordination—very
                    informal. I had country team meetings once a week. But I would usually see my
                    chief of station once or twice—once a day—or every other day, informally. I kept
                    an open door, and I expected if there was anything of interest going on he would
                    stroll in and tell me about it, or at least get an appointment and stroll in
                    when I didn't have somebody with me. I think, by the way, he got a very rotten
                    deal in the Iran-gate business. They made him a scapegoat. I think it speaks
                    very badly of the Agency, that they would do that to him. Because he was a very,
                    very careful man. And he did nothing that wasn't authorized, I'm quite certain,
                    from higher up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the use of the media, both your USIA, and
                        media interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I used to call USIA “useless,” instead of USIS. We had a very ineffective
                    USIA operation for part of the time there. I started out, and I got spoiled by
                    having a terrific PAO, which made all the difference. Then I ended up with a—I
                    would say—a very ineffective one, which I would say—it didn't make our life as
                    difficult as it would have in a different kind of country—but we, at that time,
                    had very good relations—and still do—with the Costa Rican press.</p>
                <p>But what this woman did was really antagonize—was minimize the naturally good
                    relationship that existed and gave us no opportunity to build on it. She's out
                    of there now, but she cost me, and she cost my successor, a great deal. I
                    advised him to fire her, but he didn't listen to me on that. Also, it's hard to
                    get rid of them. But she's now going into retirement.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>But I must say that I was spoiled by the one I had up until December of '83. Her
                    name was McCaffey, and she was superb. She's now in Chile. I'd say that she was
                    good enough to be an ambassador. She had a great talent for dealing effectively
                    with people politically, in the media, and in every way. I went from excellent
                    to the worst, or to about as bad as you can get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about your relations with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: In Costa Rica?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Costa Rica. I mean, the American Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: We had a tremendous number of Congressional visitors coming through. My
                    own relations were excellent. I still regard, of all people, Steve Solarz as a
                    personal friend, and I enjoy having a good fight with Steve over an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Steve Solarz is a Democratic Congressman from New
                        York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: New York, yes, who's very abrasive, and who's very bright, but who's been
                    a critic of the policy. I got along very well with him because at the end of my
                    tenure I had become a critic of the policy myself. And we had great fun talking
                    about it, from very different points of view. We were critics of it from
                    different vantage points.</p>
                <p>I must say that one of the most enjoyable evenings I had in my tour in Costa Rica
                    was a dinner for Steve Solarz. Just my political counselor and I had him to
                    dinner with three former foreign ministers of Costa Rica, all of whom spoke
                    English. Fernando Volio, who is a brilliant man, Jorge Rossi and Gonzalo
                    Facio.</p>
                <p>At that time the Department of State was still attempting to defend the Contadora
                    process, and the Department of State was attempting to continue to negotiate
                    with the Sandinistas, unilaterally. And these chaps got loose on Steve Solarz,
                    on this stuff. And Steve, because he, of course, would oppose anything that
                    would confront the Sandinistas, found himself supporting the administration's
                    position. Two hours later, with his jacket off and sweating profusely, Steve
                    Solarz staggered out of the dinner and said, “Curt, only you could have set me
                    up to defend the Reagan administration, for two-and-a-half hours, in Central
                    America.”</p>
                <p>And I have to admit my only regret was that I didn't have a television camera,
                    because Solarz put on one of the most spectacular defenses of an indefensible
                    policy that I've seen in years. The man's a superb debater. I wish he were on my
                    side.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But we had no problems with the Congress, except for one very bad visit by
                    Rostenkowski, on the Ways and Means Committee, who came down to announce the
                    Caribbean Basin Initiative as though they were God touching the hand of man;
                    when in fact they were giving away nothing. And, you know, the arrogance of that
                    particular individual was really the only really sour point in my otherwise very
                    productive relations with visiting Congressmen, of both parties. The other
                    marvelous visitor we had was Pat Moynihan, who I always admired. And getting to
                    know him compounded that, even though, of course, he's a critic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Pat Moynihan of New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Senator Pat Moynihan, yes, of New York, who consumed—from cork to
                    bottom—one entire bottle of brandy in three hours, sitting in our living room, I
                    couldn't believe it, and who never once lost his stride—he has an incredible
                    intellect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from the White House, were you getting any
                        instructions from the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: No. In fact, I got into a lot—one of my main problems with Tony Motley,
                    who was my nemesis at the Department—was that I kept in close touch with
                    Constantine Menges, who was then the Latin American guy for the NSC staff.
                    Particularly on the Nicaraguan geopolitical side of things. That annoyed Motley
                    no end because he and Menges had been waging war on these issues; the
                    internecine conflict of the Washington scene for well over a year. But I didn't
                    get instructions from the White House, and nor was there anyone there who would
                    have been dumb enough to try to give them to me. I mean, I knew Ollie North very
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ollie North, being with . . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: On the NSC staff—of great fame lately. If Ollie had something in mind, he
                    would have asked me about it. And if I had survived, I'd like to think, that I
                    would have at least talked him out of a few of the bad ideas he did put in
                    motion in Costa Rica. But Ollie had in— well, it doesn't pay to speak to ill of
                    my successor—but let's say my successor, although he had great courage in front
                    of narco-traffickers, had no courage at all when it came to politics. And he
                    said, “Yes sir, no sir, yes sir.” to some of Ollie's harebrained ideas, and got
                    the thing into much deeper trouble than it should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this comes to why your relations with Motley and
                        all-what brought about your departure from Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Basically, I disagreed with the policy. I felt that the policy, with
                    respect to Nicaragua, was wrong. At one point I came back with a memorandum,
                    which stated flatly that the President had been lied to. I won't go into that
                    because it was classified. But suffice it to say, that the President had in fact
                    . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking of the American President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Of the United States, yes. That memorandum was then put into the hands of
                    three members of the U.S. Cabinet, and the resulting debate almost caused
                    another Cabinet member—you can imagine who it is—his job. At that point,
                    however, a decision was made and that Cabinet member remained and the other two
                    left. I would say the National Security Advisor was one of them. This was Bill
                    Clark, Casey—well Bill Clark, Casey and Kirkpatrick were the three. Two of them
                    left. At that point my tenure in Costa Rica became impossible, and I had to
                    depart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember—this is . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: That was, you know, putting yourself in harm's way. I put myself in
                    harm's way, and one has to expect consequences from . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you felt that the issue was sufficient to . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, I felt that we were playing to lose, and that the Department—not the
                    Secretary, but an element that the Secretary respected apparently—had lied, or
                    had written papers that had lied, and that I could demonstrate that they had
                    lied to the President. This is Motley. Motley was dismissed a couple of months
                    after I left, but it never really became public what he had done. And the United
                    States' policy and credibility had been endangered there.</p>
                <p>Now this had nothing to do with Iran-gate, at that point. I was talking strictly
                    about the way we were supporting—not supporting—or dealing with the Central
                    American problem, the Contras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the other ambassadors there,
                        because this was a very politicized group, if I recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Uniformly excellent. I got along with everybody except for Bergold, who I
                    felt was a . . .</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was . . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Bergold was the relatively new ambassador in Nicaragua, just as I was
                    leaving. Tony Quainton was an old friend of mine from the Foreign Service. And
                    although we disagreed on a lot of things we got along very well personally. John
                    Negroponte and I got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you consult quite frequently, to sit down and get
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: My friend Tom Pickering was up at Salvador. Yes, we talked rather
                    frequently. Motley went out of his way to try to prevent us from getting
                    together, for obvious reasons, that would become known at the end. But we did
                    talk quite frequently. And when there were problems we would exchange
                    information, usually on the classified telephone, which works marginally, but it
                    usually works just enough for you to get the gist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have to shout over it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Ted Briggs, I got along also very well with. In fact, I still keep in
                    touch with him. Bergold I felt, by the way, did a very dishonest job as U.S.
                    Ambassador in Nicaragua, in that he felt and treated that embassy as if it were
                    an Eastern European embassy, where we're dealing with comfortable communist
                    states that we have more or less reconciled ourselves to. And his attitude in
                    Nicaragua was along the same line. And I felt that was extremely destructive of
                    the marginal U.S. presence there, and its justification. I believe that I am
                    joined in that feeling by a lot of the—by some people in ARA even today.</p>

                        want to call it that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, I fully expected it when I heard that George Shultz had survived
                    the fight at the Cabinet level. I was a chicken hawk messing in a fight amongst
                    eagles. You don't keep your feathers that way. I was notified by Ron Spiers that
                    . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Under Secretary for Management, I think, in the

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes. I was removed within a very short period of time. And they did it,
                    you know, attempting to give me the minimum amount of grace that I could, for
                    getting out. I ended up leaving on the 28th of February, as I recall. They did
                    it in a fairly ugly way, although I had a lot of support both from my embassy
                    and from—particularly the Costa Ricans, who were fully aware of what was going
                    on. And the result, in fact, was really rather sad. Because there was a
                    tremendous wave of letters from people in the government of Costa Rica to the
                    President to try to change things around. Even before the axe fell they knew
                    what I was up against.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. I just want to switch over. [Tape
                        interrupted]Mr. Ambassador, during this crisis how well did you feel
                        supported by your embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Well, the embassy as a whole, very well indeed. By my DCM, not at all.
                    That was the one mistake in my tour, which I would never make again if I ever
                    get another embassy. I think a DCM should be, above all, loyal to his ambassador
                    as long as it doesn't require his going against the policy of the United States.
                    And it turned out that he had been, in effect, ratting on an open line to
                    Motley's people about everything that I had done which they might take exception
                    to, in terms of any conversations that I had held. And I included him in all of
                    my conversations. He had released speeches that I had given, and I speak
                    extemporaneously without my clearance, to the press and to the Department. He
                    did a number of things along that line that should have, in my view now,
                    warranted my dismissing him as DCM. And I didn't. I was too proud to do it. I
                    felt I could work with him. He was a good administrative type. I don't think it
                    cost me my job, but it cost me, I would say, a lot it may have exacerbated the
                    problems I had with State far more than they needed to be. He was my largest
                    mistake, and really the only major personnel problem other than the
                    ineffectiveness of my economic fellow, and my PAO, for different reasons. He was
                    the only really negative thing that ran against the performance of my
                    mission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember exactly, but there was something about

                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I was a political appointee. I was very active in Republican Party
                    politics, and he asked for my endorsement. I liked Jesse Helms and his people. I
                    would rather have seen a Republican in that Senate seat than a Democrat, and why
                    should I pretend otherwise? I serve the President of the United States. So I
                    endorsed Jesse Helms, and I'd do it again with no apologies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Jesse Helms' role in this? Because he's taken a
                        very strong—we're speaking of the major Republican figure in the Foreign
                        Relations Committee—he's taken quite a strong role in policies, particularly
                        with Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WINSOR: He's the ranking minority member now. Well, he has an interest in it. I
                    was never close to Helms per se. Except, of course, he did preside over my
                    confirmation hearing. I've never been—unlike some of the other political
                    ambassadors, one of Helms' staffers or of his camp. But by the same token, I
                    don't generally have too many disagreements with Helms' positions. And I felt
                    very comfortable, when asked, endorsing Helms' for re-election, as opposed to a
                    Democrat who presumably would have voted against the administration's policies
                    in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was not a close relationship? You weren't sort
                        of one of Jesse Helms' boys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: No, that's generally well known. I mean, there are some other people
                    like, say, Dick McCormack and Lew Tambs, who were. But I was not. And indeed, to
                    pacify Helms, Shultz very cleverly put Lew Tambs in as my replacement when he
                    removed me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, did you play any role in discussing
                        what you felt was our failure or our misconceived policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: Yes, but of course, at that point the tide was running very much against
                    all of my friends. Constantine Menages was having problems, as were most of my
                    fellow ambassadors, who were in the area and who shared my views. John
                    Negroponte was removed and put into OES, ironically. Whenever John gets into
                    trouble they throw him into “tuna.” They did that after in Southeast Asia; they
                    made him the tuna negotiator. And now in Central America they put him over the
                    OES Bureau. Now, of course, John's in a catbird seat at the NSC, and I hope
                    maybe he'll do some good. He's about the only one who can.</p>
                <p>Ted Briggs was a good friend, and I kept in touch with him in Panama. Pickering,
                    of course, had gone out to the Middle East. They had moved him out a little more
                    quickly than originally had been planned. Because I think he was too strong an
                    ambassador for the ARA Bureau, which was intent on doing a policy with yes men
                    in the embassies, which is not unheard of for them. And this was, I think, one
                    of their motivations for clearing things out.</p>
                <p>My own particular problem I brought on myself, because of getting involved in
                    that other issue, which is high politics. But there was also a general change
                    away from the stronger Reaganaut, or hard-line U.S. ambassadors in the area,
                    with the exception of Briggs, who was finally put back into Honduras. I think
                    the result has been chaotic perceptions of U.S. consistency in policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on this, what would you say, in your
                        assignment there, was probably your greatest accomplishment and then the
                        reverse, the greatest disappointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: There are two great accomplishments, that I view. One is the
                    dismantlement of the parastatal enterprises; I put that project together and got
                    the government to agree to it, and it is underway and I think will be effective
                    within the next year it'll be completed. That was a major move and it got the
                    Costa Ricans to do what they had to do to help themselves.</p>
                <p>And the other one, which is more strategic, the one that was more tactical was
                    the getting the arranging of Costa Rica's refinancing. That was, I thought, a
                    singularly notable accomplishment given the handicaps, the opposition that we
                    faced. The fact that we actually got it done made the difference between success
                    and failure for Monge's administration, and I think, gave Costa Rica a
                    tremendous lift. During that period she was able to get her
                    exports—non-traditional exports—up from about $70,000,000 a year to over
                    $400,000,000 a day or $380,000,000 a day. I think a lot of that is because of
                    the financial burden we lifted off the Costa Ricans at just the right time. And
                    opening up her credit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the reverse side, the disappointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: My biggest disappointment came after I left, with the dissolution of the
                    defense element on the frontier and the intelligence element within the country,
                    which I felt would have enabled Costa Rica to protect herself without having an
                    army.</p>
                <p>In terms of my own mistakes, the only mistake that I really fault myself for was
                    not firing my DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had considered this at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I considered it in April of '84, and I thought I could live with it. I
                    caught him leaking, to the people in the Department, stuff he shouldn't have,
                    and letting out unauthorized speeches, which he had no business doing. And that
                    shall we say, one of my fellow career ambassadors, not a political ambassador,
                    came all the way down from post to tell me to fire the guy, in December of 1983,
                    and I was too proud to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said December of 1983 or '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: December '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because this interview is being conducted, in part,
                        for the training of Foreign Service Officers as they come into understand
                        how the policy works, what was your evaluation having seen it both from
                        within and out of the Foreign Service when you were at Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINSOR: I am, unlike many conservatives, a fan of the Foreign Service. I was an
                    FSO. I feel good about FSOs. I feel that in many cases the very fine Foreign
                    Service Officers are pearls thrown before swine. But unfortunately, a lot of the
                    swine are of their own making. I look at elements in the leadership of the
                    Department of State as having created a system in there, which take the best and
                    the brightest and reduce them to, in many cases, yes-men or people who go along
                    with the flow. This is a terrible contradiction. Because on the one hand you
                    have in the Foreign Service and the Department the elite of the United States
                    Civil Service, the finest people that the United States has to offer. And by the
                    very structure of the Department we then, in effect, undercut a system which
                    should, in effect, bring the foremost upward and bring their thinking to the
                    fore.</p>
                <p>Today I would say the way the Department works is totally contrary to that. And
                    it favors the interests of the relatively small, entrenched, old boy network. I
                    won't say they're not fast trackers who get up into it quickly, but which I
                    believe has undercut what should be the effectiveness of the Department by
                    creating a sense of fear, of retribution for original thinking, for boat
                    rockers, for people who do not fit a smooth norm.</p>
                <p>The John Negropontes, Tom Pickerings still make it, and that's a good sign. But
                    there are too few of them now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well I thank you very much.</hi>
