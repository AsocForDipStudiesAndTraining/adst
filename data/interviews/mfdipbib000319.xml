                <p>HENRY DUNLAP</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Hans Tuch </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 25, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interviewing Henry Dunlap at his home in Washington,
                        DC on January 25, 1988. Henry Dunlap was born in Buffalo, New York in 1917.
                        He attended Canisius College in Buffalo where he received his BS degree and
                        the University of Buffalo where he received his bachelor of library science
                        degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Henry Dunlap was in the Foreign Service serving in Germany, Ghana and Austria,
                    and of course in Washington. He retired from the Foreign Service in 1977. Henry,
                    good morning.</p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Good morning,</p>
                <p>Early Post War Days in Germany and 1951 Incorporation into State Department's
                    HICOG</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into all of this, meaning of course
                        getting into the Foreign Service and particularly getting into public
                        diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well I got into the Foreign Service sort of by, I guess, default you
                    could say. You may remember that when the State Department took over military
                    government, I along with many others was an employee of the Army serving in
                    occupation business. I happened to be librarian of the Office of Military
                    Government in Berlin and Frankfurt. When the State Department took over the
                    occupation business, they also took the people. And by so doing I went from
                    being and Army Department employee to a State Department employee.</p>
                <p>Then in — I think it was '51 — I was seduced from the library job into becoming
                    Director of the American Houses in Germany where I worked from 1951 to 1954 at
                    which time I left Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into the America House occupation, when you
                        were with the military government and first transferred into the high
                        commissioner's office, you were the archivist of the Allied High
                        Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were located first in Berlin and then in
                        Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, first Berlin then my library was in Frankfurt. And then for a year
                    I was both chief librarian and U.S. Archivist in Bonn and in Frankfurt. Then I
                    moved to Bonn with the family and ended up as just U. S. Archivist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the U. S. Archivist job, were these the Occupation
                        and the High Commission archives or the Allied archives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: No, this was the High Commission, the Allied General Secretariat which
                    was on the Petersburg, in Bonn by Bad Godesberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the U. S. archives that you controlled or
                        supervised located with the Allied High Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: No, it's a little complicated. There were three archivists with the
                    Allied High Commission. The senior one was a Frenchman, a Colonel Decaix. The
                    British one was a lady, Doris Dumble. And Henry Dunlap was the American
                    archivist. And actually though we kept all the records, Colonel Decaix kept the
                    important originals. Our main job really was the issuance every month of the
                    Allied High Commission Gazette which came out in English, French and German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: German also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yeah.</p>
                <p>1951: Becomes Director of Amerika Hauser in Germany</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1951 you took over the direction of the America
                        House program. Could you just briefly say what that involved at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, the America House program at that time included 48 America Houses —
                    which means, as you know, 48 big establishments — and 110 small establishments
                    called German American libraries, Deutch-Amenkanische Bibliotheken. And they
                    were all over West Germany, including Berlin. I believe we had a total of 700
                    German employees and something like 50 Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me what at that time was the purpose of these America
                        Houses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, in the very beginning the purpose was — I'm glad you asked that. In
                    the very beginning the purpose was to bring to the German users of the
                    facilities information really only about the United States, that we knew that
                    they'd been denied since about 1933. And we thought our job was to provide, to
                    fill in the gap.</p>
                <p>After a few years of the program — and this was really, I think, before I took it
                    over — instead of becoming a window to America it became a window to the West.
                    We felt that the Germans had been denied knowledge of the whole free world. So
                    it was broadened out to include the West. [It included] I think our most
                    important thing in a way were our libraries with our books and magazines and
                    newspapers. But we had lectures, concerts, exhibits. We even were laughed at for
                    teaching finger painting for children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many of the cities of Germany the America House really
                        became known as the community center because of a lack of any other facility
                        to have cultural and community activities taking place before they were
                        rebuilt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: That's correct. For example, it was sort of funny. One of the many
                    advantages was that in the very early days we had light and heat and other
                    people didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: And we also had space and we had through the cooperation of the Army in
                    particular our buildings were repaired, well maintained and looked after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this all part of the U.S. Government's reorientation
                        and re-education program that was carried out by the U. S. Government and
                        Germany, in the western — its occupation zone of Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, also Austria. Although Austria was apparently different, it actually
                    wasn't. But it looked different.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what did the direction of these American Houses from
                        your point of view, from Bonn, what did that really entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: First of all, it entailed the acquisition and distribution of materials
                    for the whole network, all the books, exhibits, anything that was used in the
                    whole program we acquired and distributed. Policy direction as well, efforts to
                    get all the American Houses to publish monthly programs. Among the things we
                    provided were lecturers and musical performers. Mainly the central organization
                    provided considerable direction, but mainly backup services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Backup services and policy direction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These 48 American Houses and over 100 reading rooms, did
                        that continue? Was there a curtailment of budget? How long did that sort of
                        thing last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, there was a curtailment budget-wise. We had to cut the number of
                    America Houses until I think long after I had left there were only six big ones.
                    The German American libraries, the 110 or so, as far as I know most of them were
                    either included in the local library of German origin or just disappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was quite a bit after you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Oh, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your predecessor in running the America
                        House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Mrs. Patricia Van Delden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she I think, when you took over, was transferred to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I think so, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DUNLAP: B. Franklin Steiner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B. Franklin Steiner, right. Now, there are of course I
                        think a lot of anecdotes connected —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: No, what about Joe Hodge?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: He was first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Then Steiner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Steiner was his deputy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's right. And your deputy was Roger Ross, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Right. I should only comment that, it's a negative one on my successor
                    but it must be put on the record, that he proceeded to do with alacrity some of
                    the things that we had resisted in order to preserve the program. And that's an
                    upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when you were head of the America House program was
                        there a good deal of support for you and your activities from, say, the High
                        Commissioner's office and from the High Commissioner and from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Oh, yes. I would say there was. We were able to spend money efficiently
                    so that every year at the end of the budget year we'd be notified that we could
                    have $100,000 to $200,000 for books because other people had not been able to
                    spend it properly. And we usually did spend — we always spent it and we always
                    spent it properly. Because we had maintained lists of books and equipment and
                    things that we would need if we ever got the money. And we were ready to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the people who were the America House directors
                        during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Personnel of the Amerika Hauser</p>
                <p>DUNLAP: You mean specifically who they were?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were they foreign service officers? Or were they
                        specialists in running programs in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, this leads to a good point that I wanted to be sure to include. The
                    America House network included a lot of former Kreis Resident Officers. And I
                    think that you, Tom, could explain as well as I what they were. We looked on
                    them in our day as the sort of eyes and ears of the occupation. They were
                    stationed all over Germany in little towns, big cities, practically
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean “kreis” which was the equivalent of county.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the American occupied area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes. And when those positions were eliminated, many of the KROs came into
                    the America House program and we found jobs for them. I think it was by and
                    large a favorable development.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Then there were others. There were foreign service types, some people
                    that were hired in Germany itself, Americans as I think you yourself were. It
                    was a complete mix of people of all kinds.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember distinctly our America House director in
                        Munich, a nice woman, who had her lecture program. And she wanted to
                        emphasize the role of women in U. S. society. She had a woman lecturer and
                        she plastered the whole city of Munich on these kiosks which were called
                        Litwassaenlen and which had all kinds of announcements and advertisements
                        for cultural activities throughout the city. She had a huge poster in which
                        she advertised the lecture at the America House. And the title of the
                        lecture was “The Position of Woman in Marriage.” That became sort of a
                        byword.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: She had some other ones. She had an anthropological lecture the title of
                    which was “Adam wo bist Du?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Adam where art thou?”Programming in Amerika Hauser</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Also she had very attractive monthly programs as you may remember. But in
                    some of the programs we had some real problems. One of them wanted to celebrate
                    Huckleberry Finn. So they showed a picture on the cover of Joe, the black man,
                    eating a watermelon and slopping it all over everything. Certainly, this was
                    well before there were any questions of civil rights. But we really raised hell
                    about that particular illustration which was a famous classic drawing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the America House program in Germany suffer at all
                        under the McCarthy aberration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I'm sorry you asked that. Of course, we did. You and I as you may
                    remember personally suffered. It was for us, of course, a very sad experience.
                    But I don't think that I should say — I don't think the program suffered. But we
                    certainly took a mauling. It was a nasty experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any problems with putting books in the

                        by Washington what we had in our collections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: They were criticized by McCarthy's people. But I think of all the
                    nonsense that McCarthy's committee published, we maybe had four books which were
                    totally harmless in content by people who McCarthy said were communists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they as an example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Oh, gosh. One was a woman who wrote a book called Four Cornerstones of
                    Peace, Utley, Frieda Utley.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: And while she could have been a socialist, she certainly wasn't, I don't
                    think, a communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember they also criticized Dashiell Hammett's Thin

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, because the claim was that Mr. Hammett was a communist. I
                    incidentally have never known whether he was or wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole America House operation being the size that it
                        was must have been managerially also a very complicated, huge operation,
                        just the number of books that were ordered for the America House and
                        distributed. How was this managed by you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, it was a big job. As I said, we had probably 700 employees. That
                    alone is a problem. But we were very fortunate. Because by and large they were
                    all first class people. We actually organized what we called a central
                    distribution center which was in Frankfurt run by a librarian, Garnetta Kramer,
                    who was a very good organizer. We ordered all our books, posters and things of
                    that type. They came to the center. The books were catalogued and labeled and
                    distributed to all the houses. Actually, it was a very efficient, centrally run
                    operation. And what a terrible amount of work. We had a big photo lab in
                    Frankfurt. You can laugh. I'm not going to tell that story. And our exhibit
                    central operation was in Bonn. And it too was just as efficient. And our
                    speakers and artists office was headquartered in Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the number of books were not really counted in
                        numbers but in tons of books.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were handled by the distribution center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I think it was hard to do. Because as our budget was prepared, our own,
                    the 700 American salaries, the American and other salaries were sort of
                    separate. But I think it was about $3.5 million a year for everything which
                    really was a very small expenditure when you think of what was being spent on
                    other things and also much of this was ultimately paid for by the Germans
                    themselves. They were cost-of-occupation.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Just briefly could you tell me something about the
                        — you had a central distribution center for your libraries, for your
                        handling books, posters, photo lab, but you also had, you mentioned a
                        speakers and artists bureau. What did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: They located singers, performers, speakers, lecturers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: No, no. Anywhere. And we often made up teams or pairs. One time we had a
                    religious seminar. We had a rabbi, a Protestant minister and a Catholic
                    priest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Father White.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Father White who when one person asked him a question about what
                    university he went to, said, “I am a university”. But it was a very humorous
                    point. I remember in that case the Protestant minister had to go back to the
                    States. And one of our American House directors who was a minister took his
                    place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Flint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: James Flint, yes. We had some rather famous singers as you well know. And
                    we had some interesting piano players for concert, for operettas and things.</p>
                <p>

                <p>DUNLAP: Mrs. Dunlap and I were discussing recently it may have been after my day,
                    but I think the famous pianist who just had his 25th concert. He was born in
                    Nuremberg.</p>

                <p>DUNLAP: We had Leontyne Price sing for us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Someone who has sung in Porgy and Bess, I remember, a woman. We had a lot
                    of people, a lot of opera singers. And all they got from us were scrapbooks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry, while you were head of the American House program
                        in the early '50s in Germany were there any interesting developments, any
                        interesting stories which would add to our recitation here today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: At one stage Mickey Boerner who as you know was our boss. He was PAO for
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public Affairs Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: He called me in and said that due to budget restrictions I had to
                    eliminate two big America Houses. And I said, “Well, that's going to be hard.
                    But I'll see what I can do.” So I went back and got the staff together and we
                    studied and considered whether we could turn them over to the Germans or what we
                    could do. Then I went back to Mickey and said, “You know, Mickey we've decided
                    that we'll eliminate,” I think it was, “Nuremberg and one other major large
                    establishment.” And Mickey said, “My God, Henry, you can't do that. Nuremberg is
                    the first America House I ever gave a speech in.” Nevertheless, we had to shut
                    them down. This was probably the most unhappy part of my job which normally was
                    a very joyful one. The unhappy part of having to eliminate established
                    functioning efficient operations.</p>
                <p>Legacy of Amerika Hauser Programs on Germans</p>
                <p>One other comment I would like to make which has nothing to do with the
                    particular question. Although it's not measurable there's no question in my mind
                    but what the American House program in Germany had a considerable influence on a
                    considerable number of Germans. And I mean by influence a good influence to
                    acquaint them with democracy and the like. But I think one of the great effects
                    of the program which is largely ignored is the fact that the people who worked
                    for us, the Germans had a profound effect on the society when they left us and
                    returned.</p>
                <p>I remember, I think it was in the late '50s, the managing editors of three or
                    four of Germany's leading newspapers, West Germany, were people who had worked
                    for our press division which I think is very significant. And not only were they
                    important positions, they behaved in a wonderfully efficient manner.</p>

                        And there is this wonderful story about Mickey Boerner which I'm just going
                        to recite for the record. John Slocum was the press attach�, I believe, in
                        Bonn. And one day Mickey Boerner called his staff together and asked them to
                        do something. I don't remember what it was. And whatever the thing was that
                        he asked them to do did not get done. So about four days later the deputy
                        public affairs officer called the staff together and said, “You know, this
                        is terrible. You didn't follow Mickey's orders. What do you think Mickey
                        would do if he knew that this had not been done?” Where upon John Slocum
                        came up and said, “Well, the same thing that Mickey Boerner does everyday

                <p>Well, let's leave Germany for a minute. I know that you came back to Washington
                    after your tour of duty in Bonn and took over the Bibliographic Division of what
                    at that time was called the Information Center Service (ICS), which was the
                    division that selected the books that were going to be used by the America House
                    or their equivalents in other parts of the world for them to choose to stock
                    their libraries, right?</p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Right.</p>

                        Ghana as public affairs officer. And I think this is a very interesting
                        period because we really expanded our activities during the late 1950s and
                        early 1960s to other parts of the world, and especially to the developing
                        world. And in Africa you were really one of the first to run a major program
                        on that continent in what at that time, and, of course, still is a very
                        important country. Would you tell us a little bit about your activities in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, first of all, it was a very interesting assignment. And the
                    problems, you not only had the problems you had in one could say in so-called
                    advanced states like Germany or France or Italy, but you had unique tropical
                    problems, humidity, dust, difficulty in finding qualified employees only because
                    they by and large didn't exist. Ghana did have the benefit of very amicable
                    colonization by the British. And the British colonial officials without
                    exception, the ones I knew there, were more proud of Ghana, or as it had been
                    earlier the Gold Coast, than the local inhabitants themselves. Ghana had just
                    become independent when I went there and later was a prime mover in the
                    Organization of African States and things like that.</p>
                <p>We had a library, a good one, which was very well used. I remember the first
                    ambassador who was appointed by the government of Ghana to go I've forgotten
                    where, came to visit me, I happened to know him, and asked me if I could arrange
                    to train his daughter who was going with him as his secretary to save money. So
                    we brought her in and my receptionist and my staff trained her which I think was
                    very helpful.</p>
                <p>Progression of Nkrumah's Government into Totalitarianism</p>
                <p>When the Organization for African Unity had its first meeting in Accra, we lent
                    them mimeograph machines, paper, typewriters in order to conduct the meeting
                    properly. Of course, the U.S. was lambasted in the course of the meeting quite
                    frequently. Nevertheless, we helped them do this. We helped new newspapers that
                    were established. My information officer prepared a style handbook for them. We
                    were in it sort of at the ground floor as it were and were very unhappy to see
                    the later developments leading to dictatorship which Mr. Nkrumah did become.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he already at that time the head of state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But his real totalitarianism came subsequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: It didn't take long. In fact, we saw it and we wrote a paper — again, my
                    information officer, wrote a paper, quite a long one, which we sent into
                    Washington which I think by and large was ignored. But a funny thing triggered
                    the writing of the paper. Nkrumah had his mother declared a saint publicly. And
                    we decided then that this was the beginning of the end. It probably was largely
                    the fault of the U. S. in a sense that we never really took him to heart and
                    tried to be really helpful. He turned to a British leftist former member of
                    Parliament whose name escapes me at the moment who became his mentor and hatchet
                    man and just was terrible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your activities, your USIS activities in Ghana as you just
                        explained, were really in part almost like an aid program, right?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, a little bit. But we also had a newspaper. We published a
                    newspaper. And we distributed pamphlets and things of that type. For example, if
                    sometimes the newspaper, which was a monthly, was delayed a day or two because
                    it was printed on the local newspaper press and didn't get done in time, the
                    policemen at the roundabouts, circles, would yell at me when I went by. They'd
                    say, “Where's the paper? Didn't get the paper today.” And people in the agency
                    later on said the paper was used to wrap fish in which was a real canard because
                    we had 60,000 copies in Ghana. And it was the only English language document
                    that every student in a secondary school in Ghana had, which was quite important
                    for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your overall program in Ghana organized? Did you
                        have something like a country plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Oh, yes. We had a country plan, you know, the regular type.</p>

                <p>Other USIS Programming in Ghana</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, explain for a second because the listener or reader
                        will not necessarily know what that means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, it was a document which showed what your objectives were in the
                    country, your psychological objectives, and how you set out to accomplish it,
                    roughly speaking. And we had an information officer. We had a cultural affairs
                    officer. We didn't get into specialization as we had in Germany. The information
                    officer handled films. And instead of showing films in an auditorium, we often
                    showed them out at night under a banyan tree. It was interesting because every
                    time we showed films in the provinces, the people watching the film would keep
                    running around the screen to see if the people were really there. I'm not
                    ridiculing the people. It was quite an experience.</p>
                <p>And there were other things. I had a Polaroid camera. And I had to be very
                    careful to get permission to take pictures because Africans, as well as other
                    people, feel that if you take a picture you take something away from them. And,
                    of course, you do. You take their image.</p>
                <p>We had a good exchange program. One of our best exchange people was a policeman.
                    He later got his doctorate. And he's now teaching; he went back to Ghana, but
                    after a couple of revolutions I think he returned to the U. S. and is teaching
                    somewhere.</p>
                <p>We had good relationships with the school system, the private as well as the
                    public school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your exchange program dealt mostly at the university
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, we had, oh, it was microscopic in size, only five annual
                    scholarships. And we had what were then called AMSPECS, American Specialists
                    came there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To teach or to lecture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ford Foundation Folly</p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I remember one time the way things can go wrong. We had a need in the
                    local secondary school, which was called I think Achimota, they needed space for
                    boarding and there wasn't any.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So the Ford Foundation had sent two people out traveling around looking for some
                    kind of a grant to be helpful, a Mr. Fox and Mr. Wolfe. And my CAO and I advised
                    Fox and Wolfe very strenuously to give a $50,000 grant to this secondary school
                    and that would build them a dorm. They could handle the teaching but they had no
                    place to put the kids overnight.</p>
                <p>So they listened. And they ended up giving a grant on western cooking to the
                    university college of Ghana which, of course, was totally asinine. And they also
                    spent $200,000 doing it. But in most cases, private organizations, foundations,
                    as well as our government did things that were really truly helpful. I couldn't
                    resist digging Fox and Wolfe because they didn't even know what they were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you wrote your country plan and you delineated your
                        objectives, how was this exercise coordinated with the Embassy, with the
                        total overall U.S. policy as related to Ghana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, as I remember there was a country paper for Ghana which is like a
                    country plan for USIS. The country paper was for the Embassy, for the mission.
                    And we talked. When we prepared the country plan we let the Embassy look it
                    over. And we never had any particular problem. The ambassador sometimes didn't
                    understand some sort of PR type thing. But we never had any real difficulty. And
                    I'd say we got along rather well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, who was the ambassador during that

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, but at that particular time the reception was not very good. They
                    were always sending out technicians to listen to it. And it was amazing. They
                    would listen to it with metering devices and tell me how strong the signal was.
                    And I would say, “Yes, but you can't understand the words.” This was improved
                    somewhat with the construction of the relay station at Monrovia later. But that
                    still wasn't as good as we had hoped it would be. As you know, I was connected
                    with the Voice also broadcasting to Africa.</p>

                <p>Soviet Mistakes in Aiding Ghana</p>
                <p>DUNLAP: The thing that was very interesting to me was we made a lot of mistakes
                    in our programs all over the world, I don't mean just USIA but AID and the
                    Embassy. But when I was in Ghana the Russians gave the people of Guinea a huge
                    shipment of farm tractors and they were never used because they were equipped
                    with automatic heaters which couldn't be turned off. So they were run once and
                    when the driver melted that was the end of that.</p>
                <p>Another great gift the Soviets gave the Guineans, they built, I think they called
                    it a radio of the revolution. They built a transmitter on this mountain outside
                    of Conakry and it was a megawatt, terrifically powerful. Unfortunately, the
                    mountain was iron ore and the signal went out of the antenna and right into the
                    ground. So they just made me feel good that other people can make errors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes, we didn't have films. But the main problem there, one that we'd had
                    perpetually, from the very beginning our book selection policy had never been
                    what it should have been which was to decide on a book whether to use it or not
                    on what it says. Instead we got off on this track that if the authors were
                    communist or to joke, fellow traveler, whatever the hell a fellow traveler is,
                    that you wouldn't use it. We tried, we fought manfully—</p>
                <p>The problem of being forbidden to use books by communist authors, the first
                    problem was who was a communist. And the second, as I've alluded to, isn't it
                    more important what a book said than who wrote it. Because couldn't a bad person
                    write a good book? Well, we never got anywhere with that argumentation.
                    Forgetting for the moment about politics of the author, I felt then and I feel
                    now that in some way an evaluation should be done of the content of any book we
                    spend taxpayer's money on to send to people overseas. I understand that this is
                    no longer done, that any library anywhere in the world can order any book and
                    they'll get it. I think this is asinine and ridiculous and very expensive.</p>

                <p>Differences Between Shakespeare And Keogh: Loomis And Kopp</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you care to comment about the difference between those
                        two administrations and how it worked, your relationship with the two

                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: The relationships were all right in both instances. I'm trying to think
                    of the differences. The differences are only differences of personality. Henry
                    Loomis and Gene Kopp, were good friends by the way, are just totally different
                    people. Henry Loomis, who is a good friend of mine, acts frequently and quickly
                    on instinct and he's usually right. Gene Kopp, being a lawyer I suppose, was a
                    little more cautious and conservative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deliberate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes. Shakespeare was a little bit — flamboyant is not the word. But he
                    was a little bit colorful. Jim Keogh, just as fine a person, was a very quiet,
                    sort of sedate person, but a very knowledgeable and very able one. Shakespeare,
                    was very strongly anti-communist. And he was properly so, but in my opinion very
                    often for the wrong reason. I think it's a good characterization, probably true
                    of a lot of people.</p>
                <p>Included in my duties I was Secretary of the Agency Executive Committee which was
                    rather interesting because it was a high level committee and you were at the
                    very top operation of the Agency and short of instructions got out and was much
                    more complicated than one would think in an agency devoted to communication.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the concept at that time as far as the people who
                        ran the agency about what public diplomacy should do, how it should
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I think under Shakespeare the stress was very much on anti-communism
                    which I believe historically that stress was lessened under Keogh. Under Keogh's
                    successor, Reinehart, I think that anti-communism was a little bit lessened. But
                    ultimately under the current director, as I understand it, the stress on
                    anti-communism is back in full force. And I must say I have no argument with
                    this. I've always felt that almost everything the Agency has ever done has been
                    anti-communist. You didn't have to necessarily bay to the moon that you were
                    doing this. Put another way, any expression of the truth about the United
                    States' society and customs and things is in a sense anti-communist, despite Mr.
                    Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>Agency's Objectives Seen as a Mix of Long and Short Range</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to achieve our objectives more on the — on
                        the immediate basis; were we interested in short range successes or were we
                        putting our emphasis on long term exchanges and other types of programs
                        which would create an understanding of our society rather than just of our
                        immediate goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, as long as the exchange program was nominally under the Department
                    of State, although we handled it, I don't think we worried too much, now this is
                    my own view, about the long range goals. Because it was something we had to do
                    but it wasn't ours. But I do think what I've heard from people is that after
                    this was put into the Agency more attention is being paid to this. You would
                    know better than I, Tom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'm thinking also in terms of even during that period
                        when the exchange program was still in the Department's hands, we did have
                        books, English teaching exhibits on one hand, and we had press operations,
                        films, television on the other, thinking in terms of trying to produce an
                        understanding abroad of our immediate policies, of the administration's
                        policies, instead of obtaining an understanding for the American society,
                        for democracy as such. Was there a diversity of views on this? Or did the
                        Administration pursue one or in both directions at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: I think there was a mix. There were people who thought our purpose was
                    one or the other of the two you stated. But I think regardless of how people
                    felt about it, I think it ended up being a mix. For example, the library is not
                    really the place to achieve short term goals. But it is for long term goals. And
                    as far as I know the libraries continue today to be universally popular and
                    successful.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Agency handle, and you were at the top level
                        of the Agency at the time, how did the Agency handle the whole Watergate
                        episode in the early '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Well, in the beginning, this is my recollection of it, I think the Agency
                    was terribly cautious about providing information about it. I think because
                    initially I think the Agency had the same shock that our society had that this
                    thing had happened. So I think for maybe a couple of months, Agency people, I
                    may have been one of them, felt that, God, this can't be right. There's
                    something funny going on here. But I think as soon as it became clear that this
                    terrible thing had happened and as a matter of fact things generated by it were
                    continuing to happen, I would feel that the Agency handled it in a
                    straightforward sort of honest fashion. I may be wrong. I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the Vietnam War was still very much going on at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the handling of the Vietnam War, the reporting of our
                        policies and our activities to the world, was that a matter of controversy
                        within the Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: What time frame are you talking about?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about 1972, '73, '74, '75 in that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNLAP: There was controversy among young officers certainly. As far as I
                    remember, of course, I was sitting up at the top of the heap at that period, we
                    were pretty fair about, well, we erred on the side of supporting the
                    Administration. But I don't think that was evil or bad. I think we tried to
                    support what we were trying to accomplish in Vietnam. And I know I view with
                    great distaste the young officers, I guess they were State Department officers,
                    who signed a thing like Luther's theses at Nuremberg that they were opposed to
                    the war in Vietnam. I thought if they were they should have resigned and gotten
                    out of their work. But I think we did fairly well. As a matter of fact, we
                    normally did and probably do today quite well on these controversial matters
                    which are very, very difficult to decide on by a government information
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Especially when you have the Voice of America whose
                        obligation in part is to report the news as it happens, objectively,
                        comprehensively, without any kind of a political direction to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>DUNLAP: I should get in a comment here that has nothing to do with the paper
                    you're doing. I think that the war in Vietnam — it was a war and I visited
                    Vietnam seven times during that period — was lost in the universities and media
                    in the United States. It wasn't lost in Vietnam. I felt very badly about the way
                    that that turned out and I still do. They let down our allies and we lost a lot
                    of human life. I still hesitate and I've not yet visited the wall because I felt
                    so upset about this whole thing.</p>
