                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 17, 1993. This is an interview with Walter B.
                        Smith II. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Starting with the beginning, could
                        you give me an idea of your background—where and when you were born and a
                        bit about your family, to provide an idea of who you are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was born on December 10, 1929, in Providence, Rhode Island. I went to
                    school in Providence until going away to boarding school at St. George's School
                    in Newport, Rhode Island, where I spent three years. I went to Princeton
                    University, majored in modern European history with a minor in early European
                    history and graduated in the Class of 1951. In my last year at Princeton I
                    became interested in the Russian Orthodox Church. I suspect that this may have
                    been because I met a fellow just out of college at that time named Ivan
                    Obolensky, who seemed a rather charismatic individual who came from one of the
                    oldest and, at one time, one of the most powerful families in the Russian
                    Empire. This influenced me. I was interested in church matters, so that the
                    interest in church matters and Russian affairs combined. I wrote my senior
                    thesis during my last year at Princeton on the fate of the Russian Orthodox
                    Church during the first decade of Soviet rule, though I did not know what I was
                    talking about. It was not a good thesis, but it meant that I was genuinely
                    interested in Soviet affairs.</p>
                <p>Two weeks after I graduated [from Princeton] in June, 1951, I was whisked, as an
                    ROTC Second Lieutenant, into the U.S. Army as an artillery officer. About eight
                    months later I was assigned to a heavy artillery battalion in Germany. I
                    applied, almost as a lark, for Russian language training on arrival in Germany
                    in the spring of 1952. Within a month and a half I found myself at Oberammergau
                    in a six-month, intensive Russian language course, run by the U. S. Army-Europe
                    Intelligence School, where I managed to finish the course first in a class of
                    100 students. I fell in love with the Russian language. Really, more than any
                    other, single event in my life, this affected what came after.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I got out of the Army in the summer of 1953 and was dickering with CIA about
                    possible employment. They could not get organized. They had a backlog of people
                    awaiting security clearances. So I entered the Russian Institute at Columbia
                    University. I would normally have completed the course in the allotted two years
                    but I became distracted by Middle Eastern affairs and dreamt up a program with
                    Russian history as the major and Ottoman Turkish history as the minor. I would
                    have been the first individual ever to have done this combination at Columbia
                    University, had I gone through with it. This meant that the perfectionists
                    running both departments laid on all kinds of requirements.</p>
                <p>Decision to Join the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>Fortunately for me, I met my first wife on my way to Turkey in the summer of 1955
                    on a student ship. One year later we were married. I left graduate school and
                    worked as a trainee in foreign marketing with what is now the Exxon Oil Company.
                    My first wife was the daughter of Ted Achilles, then an active duty Foreign
                    Service officer who was DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] in Paris at the time of
                    our wedding. He then went off as Ambassador to Peru. He jovially twisted my arm
                    to forget about CIA and go into the Foreign Service—and certainly to forget
                    about foreign marketing [with Exxon]. For some childish reason of pride I
                    suspect that I held off applying to the Foreign Service a year longer than I
                    might otherwise have—because I did not want to seem to be following in the
                    footsteps of my new father-in-law. But that, of course, is what I ultimately
                    did.</p>
                <p>I applied to the Foreign Service in the spring or summer of 1957 and took the
                    written exam without the knowledge of my wife or her family. We were living in
                    New York. I took the oral examination without the knowledge of my in-laws, who
                    were then in Peru. I went to Washington [for the oral examination] in the fall
                    of 1957. A couple of active duty, senior Foreign Service officers took me out
                    and got me plastered the night before I took my oral exam, and maybe that
                    helped—I do not know.</p>
                <p>In any case I entered active duty in the Foreign Service in the spring of
                    1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, that's fine. What sort of training did you get when
                        you came into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I went, of course, to the Basic Course which, in those days, was always
                    given immediately after entrance into the service. I learned nowhere near enough
                    about consular work, despite the fact that there was a fairly good introduction
                    to consular work [in the course]. I regretted later that I hadn't spent more
                    time on it.</p>
                <p>Temporary Duty in Moscow: the U.S.-USSR Exchange Program</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My first assignment, because I had studied the Russian language, was to what was,
                    in effect, the U.S.-Soviet Exchanges Staff, handling scientific, cultural, and
                    academic exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. The exchange
                    program was only a year or two old at that time. Details of these exchanges were
                    negotiated by the Director of the Staff with a Minister in the Soviet Embassy
                    [in Washington] on a weekly basis. I was the note-taker for these meetings. I
                    had been in the Foreign Service for a grand total of three months when I started
                    doing this. It was very heady stuff. Also, there was a Special Assistant to the
                    Secretary, Ambassador “Wild Bill” Lacy, who was in charge of so-called
                    “East-West Contacts.” He would meet with “Smiling Mike” Menshikov, then Soviet
                    Ambassador [to the United States], from time to time. And Ambassador Lacy used
                    me as his note-taker. So this was very exciting, indeed. Scarcely a year after I
                    entered the Foreign Service, USIA [United States Information Agency] and the
                    Department of Commerce were setting up what was to be the American National
                    Exhibition in Moscow. They suddenly realized that they could not handle it all.
                    They sent an SOS to the Department of State, and three young, bushy-tailed
                    Foreign Service officers, having some knowledge of Russian, myself included,
                    were sent to Moscow in the summer of 1959.That was heady stuff, too. I had never
                    been there before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, how did we view the exchange
                        program? Wasn't it a major concern of ours that we'd be sending real
                        exchange people, and they'd be sending over KGB agents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is exactly what it was. There was enormous, well-intended, but naive
                    interest in the United States in the exchange program. The main role of our
                    little staff, among other things, was to obtain some kind of reciprocity in
                    return for giving the Soviets a free intelligence and propaganda ride inside the
                    United States. We tried to make sure that Americans could be exposed, to some
                    extent, to the public inside the Soviet Union. Another and not so unimportant
                    role was to play “Dutch Boy with Finger in the Dyke” with their favorite points
                    of attack, trying to keep Americans—radio stations in Minnesota, if you
                    will—from falling prey to alleged “people to people” ploys, which were part of
                    the Soviet system. The Soviets were forever trying to “end run” the U.S. federal
                    government and set up so-called exchange arrangements directly with
                    well-intended but rather ill-informed American groups. With absolutely no
                    authority we did head off at the pass a lot of these initiatives. That is what
                    the exchange operation was from the Washington end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the concern that these so-called unofficial or “end
                        run” types of exchange...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SMITH: We would have no reciprocity. If they were not negotiated directly between
                    the two governments, the Soviets could get more or less what they wanted in the
                    United States and they would not give us any chance to try and convey the
                    American point of view to the Soviet people. The only way we got to travel
                    inside the Soviet Union and to have some contact with public groups, other than
                    through strictly and tightly controlled channels, was by negotiating very hard,
                    when the Soviets wanted to do something in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Russia, the Soviet Union...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Just for three months, in the summer of 1959. But it was quite an eye
                    opener. My initial, two-year tour with the exchanges staff was running out. I
                    had, of course, hoped that I would be assigned, if not to Moscow, then to some
                    other, so-called “Iron Curtain” post. However, that was not the way it worked.
                    In those days newly appointed officers not only received consular assignments at
                    the beginning of their Foreign Service careers but usually were assigned to some
                    very large consular operation. I was no exception. I was sent to
                    Frankfurt-am-Main as a citizenship officer during my first year. There were
                    three vice consuls whose sole function in life at that time was to register the
                    births of American citizen children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had that job a little before you, from 1957 to
                        1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Where?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Consular Work in Germany</p>
                <p>SMITH: Then you know exactly what I am talking about. It was one of the largest
                    consular districts in the world in terms of American citizens, mainly because of
                    military dependents. The military thought that the Foreign Service operation was
                    laughable. They were so self-contained. They took care of all of their own
                    requirements, except for one detail. That is, children born abroad to soldier
                    fathers and, in the cases I worked on, non-U.S. citizen mothers. The children
                    could not enter the United States without documentation. We had a very hard
                    nosed chief of the Consular Section then, Henry Goldsmith, who played hard ball
                    and delayed the reassignment of U.S. soldiers back to the United States, if, as
                    often happened to a man with an alien wife, her documentation or their child's
                    documentation were all fouled up. It frequently happened that the child had been
                    conceived and many times even born while the soldier's wife was still married to
                    someone else. These cases got terribly complex. Frankly, I felt that, in the
                    long run, we were doing the child a service by forcing the parents to straighten
                    out the child's documentation while they were right there in Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>This assignment lasted a little less than a year because by the end of my first
                    year in Frankfurt the acting Consul General, the late Wayland Waters, yanked me
                    out of the Consular Section and said, “Here, write this post's Emergency and
                    Evacuation Plan.” The Consulate General had been completely dependent on the
                    military until then, and someone decided that this was not right and that the
                    Consulate General should have a separate plan. I did not have a clue about what
                    I was doing. I struggled with this for about three months, and then the junior
                    slot in the Political Section opened up in the summer of 1961. I moved down to
                    work with Paul Kattenburg, who was the Political Officer, just as the Berlin
                    crisis was coming to a head.</p>
                <p>Berlin Crisis of 1961</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Berlin crisis was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was “The” Berlin crisis, the crisis which grew out of the building of
                    the Berlin Wall. When did the Wall go up?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It grew out of the building of the Wall. There were U.S. and Soviet tanks
                    squared off along the Berlin Wall. Khrushchev played “Russian roulette” with us,
                    and it was a standoff, in effect. But it made for a very nerve-wracking
                    situation, and the German public, in particular, was nervous about the
                    possibility of World War III. The function of the political reporting operation
                    at Frankfurt at the time was to try to measure to some extent, not just popular
                    attitudes, but particularly the attitudes of the German political leadership.
                    This was because the opposition party, the SPD [Social Democratic Party of
                    Germany], had its leading lights in the Frankfurt area. That's what Paul
                    Kattenburg and I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, Kattenburg's German was absolutely extraordinary—he is a native of
                    Belgium and learned very good German with a heavy, Belgian-French accent. He had
                    a lot of charm and energy. He would simply go after these people and insist on
                    seeing them. He would take me along. I would be sort of a note taker. Actually,
                    I started to develop some contacts with much younger, aspiring politicians in
                    the SPD, in the Hessian state government and in the Frankfurt city government.
                    It was an act of frenzied energy, for which Paul Kattenburg is famous. We
                    churned out an enormous amount of reporting on what we were told to report
                    on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you, to use a military term, “interface” with the
                        CIA? We had a very large CIA operation there. From what you were gathering,
                        were they getting any better information than we were, or did you have any
                        feel for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were not reporting very much, to my knowledge, on the subjects which
                    Kattenburg and I were reporting on. They may have been, but it certainly never
                    came to our attention. They were focusing on some interesting things. For
                    example, there were quite a few African and Asian students who gravitated to
                    West Germany in that period because they were so frustrated at their experience
                    in trying to get a higher education inside the Soviet Union. CIA did a good deal
                    of debriefing these people, probably recruiting some of them as well. That is an
                    operation that I just learned about by accident while I was there.</p>

                <p>Polish Language Training: Consul at Warsaw</p>
                <p>SMITH: From 1960 to 1962. Then I came back to the U.S. and took the Polish
                    language course. At that time it was a 10-month course. It need not have been,
                    particularly for me, as I knew Russian, although I had to “unlearn” Russian in
                    order to learn Polish. Nevertheless, I naturally had quite a leg up because of
                    the similarity in the grammar. For about four months I recall spending most of
                    my afternoons in INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research and Analysis], trying to
                    learn about COMECON [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the Soviet Bloc
                    trade organization. I became rather convinced that it was working and that it
                    was not all sham. INR repudiated my point of view and wanted nothing to do with
                    it. INR was dead right, and I was dead wrong, but it was a learning exercise for
                    me. This was how I spent part of at my time, because there was some “slack” time
                    [in the language program].</p>
                <p>There was a nice group in my Polish class—about six officers. Of course, we all
                    went from there to Warsaw in the summer of 1963, where I was assigned to the
                    Consular Section. I was chief of the Immigrant Visa Unit, which comprised four
                    officers. There were also Non-Immigrant and Citizenship and Welfare Units in the
                    Consular Section. About six months into my tour the chief of the Consular
                    Section—I can not recall why—was reassigned to Washington. Although I was two
                    ranks below the position, I had gotten to know the DCM [Deputy Chief of
                    Mission], Bud Shearer quite well, and he offered me the job. So, after I was in
                    Warsaw for half a year, I became chief of the Consular Section, which was one of
                    the most interesting experiences I ever had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Warsaw from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: From 1963 to 1965.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Poland in that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The regime was gradually tightening up. It had raised a lot of
                    expectations in its defiance of the Soviets in 1956. This was scarcely six or
                    seven years later. It had not been able to establish any “wiggle space” for
                    itself within the Soviet embrace. Of course, the leaders of the regime, while
                    probably Polish nationalists, were communists first and foremost. It was never a
                    popular regime in Poland. The economy was not doing well. That, in particular,
                    made the regime nervous, and its response to the situation was to tighten up on
                    internal security. Nevertheless, American diplomats who took the trouble to
                    learn Polish and any other diplomats who knew Polish were not prevented from
                    having contact [with the people]. I can not imagine even the most tight fisted
                    Polish regime ever being able hermetically to seal off Polish-speaking diplomats
                    [from the people], which the regime did with ease in Moscow. We were followed
                    wherever we drove in Poland, but there were no “closed areas,” except for
                    obvious military camps.</p>
                <p>A Diplomat's Life in Poland - 1960s</p>
                <p>My first wife learned Polish. She had also learned Russian, at the time she went
                    with me to Moscow in 1959. She had taken a “crash” course in Russian. She now
                    learned Polish. We drove all over Poland and used our language. We had a German
                    nurse—we already had four very small children by the time we got to Warsaw. We
                    had a wonderful German nurse, and that “liberated” my wife to participate in the
                    more intellectually stimulating and more human dimensions of Foreign Service
                    life. She was very good at it and she loved it.</p>
                <p>I was directly transferred in the summer of 1965 from Warsaw to Moscow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stay with Warsaw for a bit. In the first place,
                        talking about the life there, it hadn't been too long—three or four
                        years—since there had been a rather famous case of [the Polish intelligence
                        service's] “turning” one of our General Services Officers. Did you find it a
                        problem getting information from [the Polish people]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think that the Department was understandably nervous about the staff in
                    Warsaw. The security people [in the Embassy] were a lot more numerous than they
                    normally would have been. They talked to us regularly [about the security risks]
                    but they did not establish the kind of rules which would have hampered our
                    ability to have contacts in Warsaw. There were all kinds of rules about
                    reporting unusual incidents to them, but there were no restrictions on language
                    officers contacting Poles. Even consular officers were welcome to have social
                    contacts with Poles. And we did—all of us. That made all the difference in the
                    world.As I started to say, I went from Warsaw to Moscow. In this one critical
                    respect it was like going from day to night, in terms of being able to have
                    contacts, although I did have a lot more contact in Moscow than people normally
                    do, obviously because the KGB assigned some interesting young people to be my
                    “friends.” I was a Political Officer in Moscow, and so I was allowed to do this.
                    I mean, these Russians would come to our home, and we'd go to their homes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was really fabulous. Poland had still not stepped beyond about 1920 in
                    terms of economic and social conditions, as compared with Western Europe. For
                    example, there were whole villages in Poland where the people wore wooden shoes
                    every day. There were large sections of Poland where the peasantry wore local
                    costumes as their main form of dress. There were wonderful stories told by my
                    colleagues in the Immigrant Visa Unit about peasants from the Province where so
                    many Americans of Polish origin come from, Rzeszow in southeastern Poland, a
                    lovely and charming area but economically very backward. These poor people would
                    come, as often as not, by horse cart to Warsaw, 100 miles or so away. They had
                    to be fingerprinted, for example, at the beginning of processing their immigrant
                    visa applications. Several times these immigrant visa applicants were told to go
                    and wash their hands, after they were fingerprinted, and they did not come back
                    for an hour. When they came back, they were asked where they had been. Their
                    answer was that they had gone down to the Warsaw River to wash their hands
                    because they had not heard of and had never seen running water! This made the
                    immigrant visa operation extremely interesting because it was an exposure to a
                    different period of time.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SMITH: There was an awful lot of Congressional correspondence. I felt that, as
                    chief of the Consular Section, I should spend a fair amount of time going over
                    Congressional correspondence, and I did. I found a provision in the Nationality
                    Act relating to visas intended for communists living in the Free World who
                    became disillusioned and could enter the United States on a special basis if
                    they could demonstrate that for a minimum period of time they had not only
                    ceased to be communists but had been active anti-Communists. I figured out a way
                    to use that provision of law to help Poles who, I was convinced, were
                    anti-Communists, to get special visa status to enter the United States from
                    behind the Iron Curtain. This provision had never been used before. It was very
                    satisfying to achieve that during my time there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about non-immigrant visas? Did you have to check these

                <p>Refusing Pretty Girls; U.S.-Polish Negotiations</p>
                <p>SMITH: One of our junior CIA officers, under Foreign Service “cover,” was the
                    non-immigrant visa officer throughout my time [in Warsaw] and did an
                    extraordinarily thorough and careful job. I had no concerns about our making a
                    serious error in that area. There was a lot of non-immigrant activity. A common
                    problem with non-immigrant visa applicants was that they were frequently very
                    pretty young women with no visible means of support once they got to the United
                    States. Obviously, they were going there, hoping to get married. We had to turn
                    those young ladies down routinely, which was sad but necessary. There were
                    interesting people applying for non-immigrant visas—commercial travelers, and so
                    forth, in addition to government officials, performing artists, and so on. There
                    was a brisk trade. I did not spend nearly as much time following that operation
                    as I did the immigrant visa and also the citizenship operation.</p>
                <p>There must have been a quarter of a million American citizens residing in Poland,
                    most of them elderly people receiving social security or U.S. Government annuity
                    checks. Distributing those checks was critical for those people. We also had
                    some inevitably tragic welfare cases among this large body of American
                    citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador and how did he run the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SMITH: The Ambassador was John Moors Cabot, a very old-fashioned Foreign Service
                    officer who, to his surprise, was asked at just about the same time as I became
                    chief of the Consular Section if he would negotiate a consular convention
                    between the United States and Poland. He had, of course, done a good deal of
                    negotiating. He was delighted to have something like that to do, but if he had
                    ever been a consular officer, it was 30 years earlier. He relied on me, totally,
                    for substantive advice. I went to all of the sessions with him and was his note
                    taker, his interpreter, and his telegram drafter afterwards. That certainly kept
                    my time occupied during my tour of duty in Warsaw. He and his wife were also old
                    and close friends of my then wife's parents, and so they would invite us around,
                    perhaps somewhat more often than they would normally have invited us, to be the
                    junior officer “fill in” at their official dinners. This was a good education
                    and preparation for the future, too.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Traveling Under the KGB's Gaze</p>
                <p>SMITH: For the first six months I was in charge of publications procurement, for
                    which I had, during home leave in the summer of 1965, a rather interesting
                    orientation, primarily run by CIA. CIA had an enormous interest in this program.
                    It was legitimate espionage—that is what it was. In the course of those six
                    months I traveled 15,000 km inside the Soviet Union, because the bookstores in
                    Moscow—especially in Moscow, but also in Leningrad—would run out of key books
                    which we needed to buy in bulk. We would buy as many as 30 or 40 copies of newly
                    published books. You did not just order the books. You physically took
                    possession of them. We had a system for this, which had been worked out with
                    some imagination. We carried cartons with us. What is that wonderful tape that
                    is totally unbreakable? To the absolute amazement of Soviet bookstore personnel,
                    we would buy the books on the spot and load them into our cartons and push them
                    on one of those rollers. We would hire a taxi for the whole day, and by the end
                    of the day the taxi would be bulging at the seams with cartons and cartons of
                    books.</p>
                <p>We went to the provinces to get books which were totally unavailable in Moscow,
                    almost immediately after publication. The more obscure the city, the better the
                    chances that we would be able to buy these books. We were not just buying for
                    the American intelligence community. We were also buying for the Library of
                    Congress, public libraries, and some universities with Russian and Soviet
                    affairs programs. So it was not just to satisfy the insatiable appetite of the
                    intelligence “gurus” that we were engaged in this activity. It was
                    exhausting.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>[In Moscow] we did not have our German “nanny,” who refused to come with us. We
                    had a very good Danish nanny, and my wife went with me on every one of those
                    trips. She had enormous powers of observation. While I was beating my brains out
                    going into bookstores, she was learning about the history and the cultural life
                    of the given city we visited—in all of the republics of the Soviet Union. We
                    never got to Siberia. That is the one part of the Soviet Union which we did not
                    visit. On one occasion we were flying from Alma Ata [Kazakhstan] back to Moscow.
                    Because our flight had been overbooked, we were routed over the Aral Sea, the
                    one that is almost completely dried up as a result of Soviet ecological
                    malfeasance. It was broad daylight. First of all, no Westerner was supposed to
                    fly over that sea. Secondly, if a Westerner had to go anywhere near the area, it
                    was supposed to be only on a night flight. But it was daylight. My wife looked
                    down and saw the Soviet nuclear testing site, located right next to that inland
                    sea. I also looked and realized what it was, and I said, “Please try to remember
                    what you are seeing.” She had an almost photographic memory. On arrival in
                    Moscow, many hours later, we went directly to the Chancery. She sat down and
                    drew a map of what she had seen, which was a “mini coup” for the intelligence
                    people.</p>
                <p>So any Foreign Service officer who had a chance to travel in the Soviet Union—and
                    the heaviest traveler of all was the publications procurement officer—had a
                    number of “coincidental” requests from the intelligence people. We cooperated
                    with that sort of activity because the opportunities were so precious and rare
                    to collect...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the Soviets let you get away with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Letting us buy books was the price that they paid to be able to travel
                    around the United States, buying books in the United States. They were already
                    overwhelmed with information about the United States, but somehow they thought
                    that they needed more. Therefore, I gather that they thought that their book
                    buying operation was as important to them as ours was to us. In terms of the
                    availability of the information, our operation was infinitely more important for
                    our purposes than theirs could possibly have been to them. Theirs was also
                    economic and technological espionage, not just political and military. They did
                    not have much that we did not know how to do better, but it was important to
                    them, and, therefore, they allowed us to do this.</p>
                <p>Soviet Middle East Attitudes</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>At the end of six months I was assigned to the Political Section to follow Soviet
                    relations with Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East—all three
                    combined. Subsequently, the Embassy peeled these off and had separate
                    individuals doing it. There was one person handling African relations because
                    the Bureau of African Affairs in the Department of State at the time had a lot
                    of money and was quite new, because independent Africa was new. The Bureau of
                    African Affairs funded its own “slot,” so to speak, in the Political Section [in
                    the Embassy in Moscow]. There was one person handling East Asia, who was usually
                    a “China hand.” There was one person handling Soviet relations with Eastern
                    Europe. I think that he belonged to “another agency” [i.e., CIA], which stands
                    to reason. Then everything else was piled together on my platter, which made my
                    job very, very interesting, because I maintained contact with Latin American,
                    West European, and Middle Eastern diplomats in Moscow. At the time the Middle
                    Eastern crisis was heating up. This was the summer and fall of 1966. The 1967
                    War was coming...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in June, 1967...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Soviets were meddling and behaving very irresponsibly and, because we
                    duly reported this and Washington already sensed this, a great deal of misguided
                    U.S. suspicion built up, in my judgment, about the unreliability of the Soviets
                    in any respect, as far as the Arab-Israeli conflict was concerned. That June war
                    in 1967 “scared the pants” off the Soviets. People do not realize how close that
                    war came to turning into World War III. It was a very, very tense time.</p>
                <p>That war is a very interesting thing, in my opinion, in terms of the evolution of
                    U.S.-Soviet relations, because our “little friend,” Israel, clobbered what
                    looked to be the large and powerful armed forces of neighboring Arab states,
                    which, with the exception of Jordan, were totally armed by the Soviet Union. So
                    U.S. made arms smashed Soviet made arms, with a tremendous difference in odds,
                    in terms of sheer numbers. But, in fact, the Soviets played it well. We were
                    declared “persona non grata” in every single Arab capital except Saudi Arabia
                    and a couple of other countries. We had a tough time regaining the confidence of
                    the Arabs because they chose to blame us for the Israeli success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was also the widely believed view [in the Arab
                        countries] that American planes had attacked the Egyptian Air Force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. Even Jordan made accusations of that kind. It made it much
                    easier for the Arabs to live with their humiliating defeat, if they could
                    attribute it to a super power, and not to their little, hated neighbor. So we
                    had a tough row to hoe after that. And between the two Middle Eastern wars, I
                    got so interested in following Soviet activities in the Middle East that, within
                    a year, I had shifted out of Soviet affairs and into the Middle East.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, can you give me any examples of how the Soviets
                        reacted to the Middle Eastern crisis when you were there—in terms of what
                        you were seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A Basic Soviet Change of Attitude</p>
                <p>SMITH: Subsequently, when I was assigned to INR, I read all of the EXDIS
                    [Exclusive Distribution] and a good deal of the NODIS [No Distribution Outside a
                    limited list] telegraphic correspondence, covering our contacts, both planned
                    and by chance, with Soviet officials worldwide, but particularly in Washington
                    and Moscow. My reading of the situation was that the Soviets were so scared that
                    they really meant it when they said, “Let us collaborate to try to contain this
                    situation.” It is my opinion that all through the summer and fall of 1967, when
                    the [UN] Security Council was having a terrible time hammering out a resolution
                    on the Arab-Israeli problem to achieve some degree of stability there, the
                    Soviets, while certainly not doing our work for us, and, in fact, occasionally
                    disrupting what we were trying to do, were nevertheless behaving relatively
                    responsibly. The issue of what the negotiating history was of Resolution 242,
                    which, as you know, was adopted in November, 1967, became critical in the
                    U.S.-Israeli dialogue.</p>
                <p>Many years later—in fact, in 1977 and 1978—[Secretary of State] Cyrus Vance asked
                    me to do a paper on the negotiating history of Resolution 242. Fortunately, the
                    NODIS telegrams could still be found. I reviewed once again the exchanges
                    between ourselves and the British and French, but especially between ourselves
                    and the Russians, as to the meaning of that resolution—and also our exchanges
                    with the Israelis on the same subject. There was no question but that the
                    resolution meant virtually total Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied
                    Territories [West Bank of the Jordan, Gaza, and the Golan Heights]. It certainly
                    meant withdrawal on all fronts. Obviously, Secretary Vance was bolstered by
                    this, because he “hung in there,” as capped by Camp David, and that is what we
                    were cranking up for at the time.</p>
                <p>Pardon the historical digression, but you asked me how the Soviets were behaving.
                    I think that the war of June 1967 was a watershed in terms of relatively
                    responsible Soviet behavior in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting demonstrations in front of the Embassy
                        [in Moscow] and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes, they could crank up one of those on a moment's notice, and they
                    did. I remember vividly that one of the staged demonstrations we had was related
                    to Vietnam. Yes, the Soviets would put on wonderful, real scary shows in front
                    of the American Embassy with, maybe, 50,000 or more people, over Vietnam at that
                    time. There were plenty of other things beside the Middle East to “churn the
                    waters” between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the KGB sort of assigned people to be
                        your “friends,” or something like that. How did this work and was this of
                        any advantage to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KGB Methods</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think so because, as I said before, with great misgivings the security
                    officers at the Embassy [in Moscow] lived with the fact that we were exchanging
                    evenings in each other's homes. Two couples who ostensibly did not know each
                    other—they probably knew of each other; we never mentioned one to the other—were
                    our interlocutors or social points of contact. One couple was much more
                    impressive, brighter, and more attractive than the other—but never mind. My wife
                    and I had gotten to know the “more attractive” couple quite well during the
                    summer of 1959, when there were so many Westerners in Moscow that the KGB just
                    totally lost its ability to monitor the situation. At that time these people
                    were students and came frequently, for the sake of English practice, to the
                    [U.S.] exhibition in Moscow. The woman did not speak any English, but the man
                    did. We went to their apartment...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were at the Exhibition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. We went to their apartment once. Also, when his parents
                    were away he took us to his parents' apartment which, by Soviet standards, was
                    quite elegant. The KGB somehow had gotten wind of this and put the “squeeze” on
                    this guy. Well, guess what, we looked him up when we came back in 1965, figuring
                    that he would make it very clear whether this were dangerous or awkward for him.
                    He had already been allowed to go to France several times because his hobby was
                    automobile racing. I have forgotten the race in southern France, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Le Mans or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, he was one of several, but very few Soviet participants in that race.
                    So the KGB and he had made their peace long ago. In any case, he was a bright
                    fellow. Of course, he tried very hard to say nothing to me or even share
                    opinions with me that would be useful from my point of view. But being bright
                    and loquacious, he could not help it. I think that Uncle Sam got a lot more out
                    of these visits back and forth than the KGB did. I would simply report the man's
                    views and opinions—that was all. There were so few such contacts. It is hard for
                    anybody living today to imagine what a thorough job the KGB did in cutting off
                    normal, informal, human contacts between our representatives in Moscow and the
                    Soviet public. So each and every fragment of semi-relaxed, human contact was
                    potentially quite valuable in terms of insights—that is all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We had two. The first one was Foy Kohler. The second was Llewellyn K.
                    “Tommy” Thompson.</p>
                <p>A Soviet Specialty in the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about your impression of those two
                        men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Foy Kohler was a scrappy, vigorous little man—a very small guy. He was
                    quite popular at the Embassy [in Moscow]. Thompson was sent back [to Moscow]
                    after Kohler left [the post]. He had been the Ambassador before Kohler. Thompson
                    was a very shy, reserved man. He had spent more time working on Soviet affairs
                    than Foy Kohler had. I do not think he wanted to be there at all. We got to know
                    his wife, who is a delightful person, fairly well. I do not know what else I can
                    tell you about their tours there. I was sufficiently junior that I did not see
                    all that much of them, though I saw them on a personal basis, particularly the
                    Thompsons, again because they were old friends of my in-laws [Mr. and Mrs. Ted
                    Achilles].</p>
                <p>That relationship made me very nervous, I should mention, during the first eight
                    years of my Foreign Service career because I did not want anyone among my peers
                    ever to think that anything I achieved in the Foreign Service could possibly
                    have been in part because of this family connection. And I do not think that it
                    was. But it did give me a leg up on others as a learning experience in the sense
                    that in my 20's and 30's I was meeting with very senior people on an informal,
                    relaxed basis. Sometimes it would just be Thompson and his wife, and my wife and
                    myself, for supper at Spaso House [residence of the American Ambassador in
                    Moscow]. This gave me a sense of the thinking and style of senior people in the
                    Foreign Service, which could only be beneficial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize morale of the Embassy [in
                        Moscow] at that time? The morale of our Embassy in Moscow seems to wax and
                        wane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I do not think that the morale of our Embassy in Moscow was ever a serious
                    problem, though I could be wrong, until the late 1970's and the early 1980's. I
                    attribute that deterioration of morale in Moscow to a slippage in the interest
                    of the Foreign Service in Soviet affairs. I do not know what that was all about,
                    either, because the Soviets continued to be our main contestant for world
                    influence. When I came into [the Service]—I do not know whether you share this
                    opinion—I found that there were very good people who fought like panthers to get
                    involved in Soviet affairs. I considered myself extremely lucky to be in
                    Moscow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was one of the choice activities for people in the political field at
                    the time. It was one of the more interesting areas to be in, and the culmination
                    of work in Soviet affairs was to get yourself assigned to Moscow. So I do not
                    think that there was a person there who was not glad to be there. Administrative
                    people were glad to be there. Some of them were trained in the Russian language
                    and some not, at that time. I think that morale in Moscow was high because it
                    was such a plum to get to go there. Life was difficult at the Embassy, but
                    everyone was well forewarned about that, and so no one could be surprised about
                    the U.S. self-imposed rules, not to mention the success of the KGB in
                    interfering with any kind of normal relationships. I think that the morale
                    problem came later and I think it came up because people were not falling all
                    over themselves to get assigned to Moscow. Some people went there rather
                    reluctantly. Then the tough conditions—there was no psychic reward for the tough
                    conditions for those people.</p>

                <p>Political - Reporting Dissent</p>
                <p>SMITH: 1967. Before we leave Moscow, could I return to one thing that I remember
                    that is of no great consequence, but you asked me what my personal reading was
                    of Soviet behavior in the Middle East? I said that the Soviets really changed
                    before and after that war [the Arab-Israeli War of 1967]. Probably for many
                    other reasons they wanted to collaborate with the United States in at least one
                    important region of the world. It was impossible to do this in East Asia because
                    of Vietnam, and so the Middle East was a candidate as an experiment on the part
                    of the Soviet Union in trying to establish themselves as a legitimate
                    interlocutor with the United States. The Soviets had great ambitions—really from
                    World War II on—to play a respectable role in the world, if we would let them.
                    So Middle East diplomacy after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War became their chosen
                    area to try to “cozy up” to us and to gain prestige. In any case there were
                    reasons why the Soviets were behaving reasonably responsibly, in my
                    judgment.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I became sufficiently concerned about the prevalent view in our government, based
                    on pre-1967 War Soviet activities in the Middle East, that the Soviets were
                    continuing to be totally ruthless and untrustworthy, that I stayed up nights,
                    writing a paper based on unclassified materials, namely, Foreign Broadcast
                    Information Service [FBIS] transcriptions, of Middle Eastern broadcasts in the
                    two months leading up to the 1967 War. I tried to show that a good deal of what
                    was assumed to be Soviet mischief was, in fact, an effort on the part of the
                    Arabs, including our friends, not only the radical Arabs, but including the
                    Saudis, the Jordanians, and other conservative Arab regimes, to get the super
                    powers involved in that problem. The Soviets, obviously, did not have anything
                    to do with it, in the case of the Saudis and Jordanians. The Soviets did not
                    even have an embassy in Saudi Arabia, as you know, until very recently. I wrote
                    this paper to show that we were going overboard in our inclination to blame all
                    kinds of problems in the Middle East on Soviet mischief. The outgoing chief of
                    the Political Section [in the Embassy in Moscow]—Gene Boster—suppressed it. He
                    was a man whom I liked very much, but he was afraid of his shadow and he was not
                    going to “buck” Washington, even though he may very well have been persuaded
                    [that this view was right].</p>
                <p>In came David Klein, about a week before I left the post [Moscow]. Now that I
                    think of it, it was not Gene Boster—I am being unfair. It was Alex Akalovsky,
                    who was acting chief of the Political Section...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a very famous translator...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. He was an astute observer. Obviously, despite his language
                    skills—he wrote English well—he was one of the most nervous bureaucrats. I liked
                    Alex. He was my immediate boss throughout my tour in the Political Section. Then
                    he became acting chief of the Political Section when Boster left. It took a
                    month to write this report after the June 1967 War. Akalovsky would not allow
                    the report to move forward.</p>
                <p>David Klein arrived about four days before I left Moscow. I became a very good,
                    amazingly good friend of Klein's. He was a controversial figure and a
                    strong-willed individual who made his reputation, I think, in his next tour as,
                    in effect, chief of the Political Section in West Berlin [USBER]. There was
                    nothing in East Berlin then. I think that Klein finally sent the report to
                    Washington. Anyhow, I thought that that was worth mentioning on two accounts:
                    one, suppression of reporting, which does not happen any more, at least in
                    theory; and, secondly, it reinforces my point that the June 1967 War really was
                    a watershed in Soviet behavior in the Middle East.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what happened to you after you left
                        Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was assigned to INR for two years to the Soviet part of INR under Helmut
                    Sonnenfeldt, who was running it then. He was an interesting character. I was
                    given the Middle Eastern portfolio [in the Soviet part of INR].</p>
                <p>As you may recall, the Soviets kept trying to engage us throughout 1968 in major
                    power talks about the Arab-Israeli problem. This is what the Arabs wanted them
                    to do, to spare them having to negotiate with Israel. They wanted the Soviets to
                    work out a deal with the Americans and to bring in the British and French if
                    necessary. We resisted this, but the Soviets kept inching closer to the Israeli
                    position in these highly confidential discussions. I was called in on New Year's
                    Eve 1968 by Sonnenfeldt and sent to Roy Atherton [then Director of Arab-Israeli
                    Affairs in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs—NEA]. Atherton was already Joe
                    Sisco's right hand man. Joe Sisco was shifting from the position of Assistant
                    Secretary of State for UN Affairs to the position of Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Near Eastern Affairs. The Soviet Ambassador [to the U.S.] had come in
                    once again on or about December 29, 1968, with still another position paper on
                    the Arab-Israeli problem and had delivered it to the Under Secretary of State. I
                    was sent by Sonnenfeldt to be of assistance to Atherton in analyzing what the
                    Soviets were up to.</p>
                <p>That fired my interest. Atherton was able to gain access to the NODIS [telegram
                    file]. Over the next three months I went furiously through every recorded
                    conversation between senior U.S. and Soviet officials and also second hand
                    reports from our people of Soviet discussions with Western officials. Generally,
                    my objective was to tabulate the evolving Soviet position on the substance of
                    the Arab-Israeli points of contention. I distinctly sensed a progression between
                    1967 and the beginning of 1969. I wrote this paper, listing all the Arab-Israeli
                    points of contention and showing an evolution of Soviet classified posturing in
                    our direction. I also did a tabulation of published Soviet positions on these
                    issues to show how much daylight there was between their diplomatic stance and
                    their public, propaganda stance.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Sisco suddenly was called in because the Soviet Ambassador—Dobrynin—came [to the
                    Department of State]. Out of this flowed what were called the Sisco-Dobrynin
                    talks on the Middle East. These began in March 1969. Sisco was given the “green
                    light” from Secretary of State William Rogers to start, on a tentative basis,
                    secret talks with Dobrynin on the Middle East. The Israelis did not know about
                    them, and SOV [Office of Soviet Affairs in the Department of State] did not even
                    know about them, at first. Sisco wanted an assessment, at the outset of these
                    talks, of the Soviet position. And guess what? Intuitively, I had done just what
                    he needed. Sisco yanked me out of INR, and I worked for Sisco intensively for
                    the following eight months, together with Roy Atherton, as one of the three
                    participants in the Sisco-Dobrynin talks on the Middle East. For a relatively
                    junior officer—I was, I guess, 39 years old—this was a heady experience. We went
                    to Moscow and met with Andrei Gromyko [Soviet Foreign Minister] for two weeks
                    because the Soviets, for reasons of “amour propre” [self esteem] had to be able
                    to say that the talks were also taking place in Moscow and not only in
                    Washington. We stayed in Spaso House. Jacob Beam was our Ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union—this was in the summer of 1969, my last visit to Moscow, I am sorry
                    to say. But staying in Spaso House was fun, too, per se. That was one of the
                    most important moments in my Foreign Service career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to what you were seeing going on, may we go
                        quickly back to INR? Sonnenfeldt was your immediate superior. He's a figure
                        that keeps cropping up in foreign policy matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He is a senior personage today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you read him at the time? How did he operate at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sonnenfeldt was a very smooth operator. He is an astute, political animal.
                    I do not think that he believed for an instant in my view that the Soviets were
                    behaving relatively responsibly and that it behooved the United States to hear
                    them out and see what kind of relationship we could work out with them. I think
                    that he was instinctively very suspicious of the Soviets then and, until not too
                    many years ago, continued to be rather a “hard liner.” He saw that I had a
                    commodity which was in demand, as far as the Secretary of State was concerned,
                    and he pushed me to a fare-thee-well. That is how I got into the Sisco-Atherton
                    operation. Sonnenfeldt pushed me in their direction. I think he must have felt
                    that, from a political point of view, it was going to be very helpful to him.
                    Actually, the minute I “belonged” to Sisco, I did not “belong” to Sonnenfeldt
                    any more, although on paper I did for about six months. Then Sisco eventually
                    had me assigned to NEA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view, what did you see in those secret
                        Soviet-American talks on the Middle East? What were the major points and how
                        did they develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In light of the evolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict since then, the
                    points at issue seem ludicrous, but, based on the history of the question up to
                    that time, they were not so funny. The Soviets were twisting the arm of the
                    Egyptians, in particular. The Soviets cleared their position with the Egyptians
                    each step of the way. We gave the Israelis only a general idea of what we were
                    up to. We did not clear our position with the Israelis. I guess we thought that
                    that would create too big a row. We were going to have a showdown with the
                    Israelis when and if we ever got to the point of what we considered a balanced
                    or tentative arrangement with the Soviets. We knew, from intelligence that I
                    cannot go into—incontrovertible intelligence—that the Soviets were twisting the
                    Egyptians' arm. Since I still had an INR “portfolio,” I was able to have access
                    to certain rarefied intelligence. It was just fascinating to me to see what the
                    Soviets were doing. They were moving very slowly, playing “hard ball” with the
                    Egyptians—but they were moving. And so were we.</p>
                <p>Then the “deep penetration raids” began after the first U.S. “Phantom” jets [F-4
                    fighters] arrived in Israel, in September 1969. To our dismay the Israelis began
                    using these planes to do “dare-devil” things across the Suez Canal. By October
                    1969 they were bombing targets around Cairo, if you remember.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “war of attrition...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, indeed, and the windows were rattling in the American School [in
                    Cairo]. We complained to the Israelis, and they said, “Move your school.”
                    [Laughter] They were not about to stop bombing Cairo for our convenience. I
                    guess, in retrospect, that I can understand that, but it sounded a little
                    arrogant at the time.</p>
                <p>Soviet Military Intervention in the Middle East</p>
                <p>After that the Soviets introduced Soviet pilots because the Egyptians were being
                    humiliated. Gradually, Soviet planes began pushing the Israeli air campaign
                    back. The United States was so upset by this, in late 1969, that we broke off
                    the U.S.-Soviet talks. We knew that this was something that meant more to them
                    than it did to us, at least potentially. So, I suppose, we figured that this was
                    a way of showing them how angry we were at what they were doing in Egypt. You
                    can hardly blame them for what they were doing in Egypt. If you reverse the
                    situation—if the Soviets had been the “sponsor” of Israel and we had been the
                    “sponsor” of Egypt—you know perfectly well that there would have been U.S.
                    pilots in there. So it was really the pot calling the kettle black, I thought.
                    It was foolish of us to break off the talks. The Soviets resisted doing anything
                    to help the Egyptians until Nasser blew the whistle on them. Nasser died in
                    September, 1970!</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>There was an interplay between the situation on the ground in the area, which the
                    Israelis really provoked, and our ability to continue any kind of dialogue with
                    the Soviets. So, of course, anything the Soviets had to say, starting in 1970,
                    was suspect, and instead of making any further effort with the Soviets, we
                    launched what became known as the “Jarring Initiative,” which the Israelis made
                    sure would fail, and which did by March or April 1970. At that point Joe Sisco,
                    who had an extraordinarily fertile imagination, dreamt up the so-called
                    “Proximity Talks.” He tried to get an Israeli and Egyptian to sit on different
                    floors in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. He was going to run back and
                    forth [between them]. The effort to organize the “Proximity Talks” continued
                    through 1970 and 1971 and gradually sputtered out after the change of
                    administrations in 1972, with Henry Kissinger's arrival on the scene [as
                    Secretary of State].</p>
                <p>Kissinger, Sonnenfeldt, and Sisco</p>
                <p>Kissinger went through an interesting metamorphosis on the Arab-Israeli problem,
                    which blew up in his face, as you know, in the fall of 1973. All of a sudden he
                    realized that a) this problem was much more important than he had understood,
                    and b) there were two sides to the story. In fairness to Kissinger he achieved
                    what seemed impossible at the time because he concentrated on the problem. He
                    saw what were legitimate Israeli concerns and what were wholly exaggerated
                    Israeli concerns. He was able to deal with this in a balanced way. But there was
                    nothing balanced in Kissinger's attitude toward the Arab-Israeli problem when he
                    came on board as National Security Adviser. He was so totally preoccupied with
                    trying to wind down the Vietnam War that he would not allow any initiatives to
                    be taken on the Arab-Israeli problem.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for me, in mid-1971 I was assigned as chief of the Political Section
                    in the embassy in Tel Aviv [Israel], and so I was spared the agony of the slow
                    death of Joe Sisco's initiative, the so-called “Proximity Talks.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about Joe Sisco—how he operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, Joe Sisco and Hal Sonnenfeldt had something very important in
                    common, and that was that they were both political animals. As you know, most
                    career Foreign Service officers are not political animals. Neither of them was
                    career Foreign Service. That may have something to do with it. They understood
                    “the game,” so to speak, between the agencies in Washington. They accurately
                    sensed what was on the mind of the White House, and they sought out “targets of
                    opportunity.” I am not trying to suggest that either man was intellectually
                    dishonest. I am simply saying that they played U.S. domestic politics, at least
                    “Washington Insider” politics, to try to achieve what they wanted to do. Most of
                    us career Foreign Service people are allergic to doing that kind of thing. That
                    is why I draw a certain parallel between Sisco and Sonnenfeldt. They were
                    “operators.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>But Sisco was also an extraordinarily clever man who managed to keep all kinds of
                    balls up in the air at once. That was one of his methods. He would meet with
                    foreign ambassadors—at least two or three a day—and cultivate the ear off these
                    guys for an hour. He was throwing sand in people's eyes—deliberately, in many
                    cases. He was getting messages back to the Soviets, in some cases; he was trying
                    to manipulate the French and British, with some success, in other cases; and he
                    was trying to influence the White House in still other cases. I was one of his
                    regular note takers, and after a while I began to see the method in his madness.
                    The guy worked about 18 hours a day. He was an indefatigable operator. He did
                    not speak correct English. I could never get over the fact that such a bright
                    person—he had a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago—would make egregious
                    errors, like: “I'm glad that this has happened to you and I,” and that kind of
                    grammatical error. That is uniquely American. You would never find a British
                    official at that level, with his brilliance, making that kind of hash out of the
                    English language. Pardon the digression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it gives us a feel for the man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He was a rough diamond—let us put it that way. He came out of the poorer
                    part of Chicago. He was tough. He was hard on people who, he felt, had let him
                    down. He was loyal to people who, he thought, were supporting him. So he was a
                    controversial person within the Foreign Service, not to mention within the
                    interagency bureaucracy. I never ceased to admire and like the man, even though
                    we did not have much in common at the time except a burning interest in the same
                    general set of problems.</p>
                <p>Major-Power Concern About the Middle East</p>
                <p>SMITH: There is a strong case to be made a) that we had a good chance, not so
                    much to solve the Arab-Israeli problem after the 1967 War, but certainly to move
                    the situation light-years ahead in terms of the security of Israel and the
                    normalization of the problem. And we missed the boat. It can be demonstrated, in
                    minute detail, that the first Israeli-Egyptian disengagement agreement, which
                    was no mean achievement on the part of Henry Kissinger in January 1974, was
                    almost identical to an arrangement which Sisco, the Israelis, and the Egyptians
                    were moving toward in the spring of 1970. A lot of thought had gone into the
                    preparation of U.S. positions and thinking through how such a partial
                    disengagement could work in the Sinai area back in 1970-71. This material was
                    just dusted off and handed to Henry Kissinger. He was the man, more than any
                    other U.S. official, who made sure it did not happen in 1970-71. He had the
                    benefit of some careful thought when he went into those disengagement...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, this brings up a point which has cropped up
                        other times, talking of Henry Kissinger. You say that he made sure that it
                        didn't happen in 1970 or so. Was this because he wasn't involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SMITH: He says in his own memoirs that he deeply resented the fact that Nixon
                    would not let him get involved in the Arab-Israeli problem for two reasons: 1)
                    Kissinger is Jewish. Nixon is a life-long anti-Semite and was very distrustful
                    of Kissinger's ability to be objective. Let us face it. Until he learned more
                    about the problem, he was not objective. But that was not the only reason that
                    Nixon kept Kissinger out of the Arab-Israeli problem, before he became Secretary
                    of State. 2) The other reason is that, behind the scenes, he was giving
                    Kissinger a free hand to run circles around Secretary of State [Rogers] in every
                    other field. He [Nixon] felt he had to reserve something for the self-respect of
                    William Rogers. The Sisco-Dobrynin talks became known as the Rogers-Dobrynin
                    talks. Without much justification Secretary of State Rogers claimed credit for
                    such progress as was initially achieved in those Two-Power Talks. At the same
                    time we had the Four-Power Talks going on in New York, in which Bob Oakley was
                    involved up to his ears. Have you interviewed him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Partly. I haven't gotten too far with the White House on
                        that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think you should. [Oakley] is a very bright guy who was very much
                    involved in some terribly important developments, and so I hope you are able to
                    pin him down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there viewing Israeli operations. We always had
                        the feeling that the Israelis could play the domestic political card or
                        something like that. Did you feel that they were looking for a
                        compromise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. They were not looking for a compromise. They had all this territory,
                    and it enabled them to avoid any kind of difficult decisions. They had total
                    distrust of the Arabs—even beyond that which was justified. Obviously, a good
                    measure of distrust of the Arabs was justified. But the Israelis were blind on
                    the subject. They certainly did use the U.S. domestic political card to try to
                    nip U.S. initiatives in the bud, frequently with success, although Sisco gave
                    them a real run for their money.</p>
                <p>I have a wonderful story to tell you—let us save it for next time—when Sisco
                    outmaneuvered the Israelis and I heard Golda Meir calling him [by telephone]
                    from Jerusalem and telling him that what he had done was absolutely outrageous.
                    He had spoken for Israel to the Soviets. This was the cease-fire-standstill
                    agreement of August 1970—the time he stopped Soviet and Israeli pilots from
                    shooting each other down over the Suez Canal. Sisco really deserves a lot of
                    credit for pulling that off. He had to “out-fox” the Israelis to do it. Mrs.
                    Meir swore at him on the telephone and said, “There is no way in heaven that
                    Israel is going to abide by this arrangement.” Guess what? The Israelis did
                    abide by the arrangement, and it gave them a nice, long, misleading period of
                    tranquility which I soon got to see from the other end, because I was then
                    assigned to Israel.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 26, 1993. Walter, we left you when you were
                        off to Israel. Could you explain how that assignment came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: After about six months of being “parked” in various corners of NEA, while
                    I was working with Assistant Secretary Sisco in connection with the U.S.-Soviet
                    Middle East Talks, I finally was “parked” on the Israeli Desk for about six
                    months, in early 1970. I then spent a year as Deputy Director of Egyptian
                    Affairs but, because I had worked both sides of the equation, I was deemed a
                    satisfactory person to send to Israel—and I was sent there as chief of the
                    Political Section. In light of the fact that major power peace efforts had
                    stalled it made a certain amount of sense to have someone in the Embassy in
                    Israel who was familiar with them, on the chance that [such talks] might get
                    cranked up again.</p>
                <p>What I was starting to address—what I mentioned last time and may have started to
                    address—was the feeling, that you rightly asked me about, of being “beleaguered”
                    in Washington, at a time when Israel became extremely nervous about U.S.
                    intentions in the Middle East and was fearful that the United States might come
                    up with a persuasive-seeming kind of equation—and then insist that Israel
                    struggle with it, in terms of an Arab-Israeli settlement. One does indeed feel
                    beleaguered in Washington because of the power of the pro-Israeli lobby.</p>
                <p>What I discovered very early on, when I arrived in Israel, was something that I
                    had not expected. That is, the Israelis—rational and logical people though they
                    are—in fact are quite emotional and irrational on the subject of the
                    Arab-Israeli conflict. They were dead sincere—not conniving and devious—in their
                    efforts to stop diplomatic activities which they honestly believed spelled only
                    danger and [even] ruin for Israel. That is a lesson which anyone assigned to the
                    Embassy in Israel ought to understand, because you realize that, rational as
                    your discussions may be with Israeli colleagues and as soon happened with
                    Israeli friends, there were certain areas, particularly during your first few
                    months of assignment to Israel, where you “pulled your punches,” lest the
                    Israelis, who were also sizing you up, as a friend or a foe of Israel, get the
                    wrong idea.</p>
                <p>Now a little “black book,” in effect, is made on newly arrived diplomats—above
                    all on American diplomats—as to whether the individual is sympathetic or not
                    sympathetic to Israel's plight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard this again and again, but not in quite as
                        strong terms as you are using. Well, since this is very important and since
                        this is a thread running through the whole situation, were you told this
                        before you went to Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SMITH: I had been told this but I did not believe it, because in Washington you
                    become convinced that the Israelis are cynical, after you have been hit on the
                    head and shoulders by all kinds of clever political operations. It is only when
                    you get there that you realize that it is not cynicism at all. It is mortal fear
                    of the imminent destruction of Israel. There is no Israel citizen who goes to
                    sleep at night without wondering whether his country will be at war the next
                    day. If you look at the map—the Israelis say this in a coy fashion: “Look at the
                    map and you'll understand the problem.” But it really is true. It is a tiny,
                    tiny country. The minute you understand this, then you understand where the
                    Israelis are coming from. You do not ever agree with them if you have studied
                    the problem, but you certainly have to be sympathetic to them. Only by being
                    sympathetic to them, without necessarily agreeing with them, will you ever get
                    anywhere with them, if you have to nudge and cajole them in directions that they
                    are fearful of.</p>
                <p>I had a high success rate in Israel. When I came back [to Washington], I became
                    Director of Israeli Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, let's talk about what your job was [in the
                        Embassy in Tel Aviv].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was chief of the Political Section.</p>
                <p>The American Embassy in Israel</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Embassy set up? Who were the Ambassador and
                        the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Ambassador was Walworth Barbour, who, at that point, had been there
                    for 10-14 years. He remained there for the first two of my three years. In my
                    third year he was replaced by Kenneth Keating, a former U.S. Senator
                    [Republican, from New York]. Ambassador Barbour was very ill. He only made it to
                    the office for one or two hours a day. He was drinking heavily and smoking very
                    heavily. He had serious lung problems. The man could barely breathe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then why was he kept on in what is considered one of our
                        “high tension” posts? Certainly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I have read some of Barbour's reporting during the early years of his
                    assignment there, when he retained his objectivity. When he was convinced that
                    the Israelis were wrong, he did not hesitate to say so, both to them and,
                    especially, to Washington. But by the time I got there, Barbour had begun to
                    lose a) his objectivity about Israel and b) his intellectual sharpness. I do not
                    like to say things about such an esteemed character, but he was almost
                    ineffective.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The DCM during the first two years I was there was Owen Zurhellen, a fantastic
                    individual who recently died, I gather. He was a “crackerjack” officer—very
                    abrasive and disliked by the people [in the Embassy] because he was blunt and
                    abrasive. But he was effective. He and I were very dissimilar in personality but
                    we took to each other. Thank goodness. Because he really was very dubious about
                    whether I was going to “cut the mustard” during the first couple of months I was
                    there. I worked my tail off—not because I wanted to have a good relationship
                    with him but because the assignment was so challenging to me. At the end of
                    three months he called me in and said: “I am surprised to find myself saying
                    this to you, but I want you to know that you are doing a good job.” And so it
                    went.</p>
                <p>These were the halcyon days when the Israelis lived in never-never land, thinking
                    that the 1967 War had solved their problems and that war was not going to come
                    at any time soon. Israel was enjoying unheard of prosperity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the period when you were there [in Israel]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was there from 1971 to 1974. So I saw the unrealism of Israeli thinking
                    that preceded the 1973 War and the devastating psychological effect of the 1973
                    War which, as you know, the Israelis won. And if we had let them go, as often
                    happens with those wars, they would have won it on both Syrian and Egyptian
                    fronts with a resounding bang. We pulled their punches for them. They won the
                    wars, but the Egyptians and the Syrians were not convinced that they were
                    defeated. Henry Kissinger had “seen the light.” In a very short span of time he
                    realized that if there was any hope of reaching some kind of accommodation after
                    this war, the Israelis could not be allowed to occupy Damascus and Cairo. So
                    Kissinger had something to do with the fact that we and the Soviets—as had
                    happened in 1967—imposed a cease-fire just as the Israelis were finally
                    regaining their strength and getting ready to do something.</p>

                        arrived, you have to pull your punches, you can't overly engage Israelis

                <p>SMITH: You just work extremely hard and do your best. I found living in Israel
                    exhilarating. My garbage collector had a Ph.D. degree, spoke four languages, and
                    was a very charming man, indeed. There are, of course, a great many poorly
                    educated and not very refined Israelis—mainly those of recent Arab extraction
                    [the Sephardim]. But certainly the European Israelis [the Ashkenazim] at this
                    time—in 1971—ran the whole place and were the people one dealt with and ran
                    into. There were certain slum areas in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem inhabited by a
                    different kind of Israeli. But the Israelis I knew were bright, extroverted,
                    energetic, creative, talented, and very, very entertaining and funny people. I
                    adored being there, and this showed—and thank goodness that it did. Because I
                    think that that helped to persuade the Israelis that a) I was someone enjoyable
                    to know and b) I was on their side. It was a fabulous experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the reporting. I've talked to other
                        people who say that if you're reporting a telegram or a cable or a
                        despatch—whatever one is sending out—a lot of it is not stating just plain
                        fact. It's also trying to accomplish something at the other end. Here you
                        were in this highly charged atmosphere. No matter what the State Department
                        did, Congress or the White House could overturn it for political reasons.
                        Things could leak. How did you and the officers working for you deal with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think you are referring in particular to reporting on the Israeli
                    internal political situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SMITH: In this case we handled it with absolute intellectual honesty. Israeli
                    politics are vibrant, very fractious, and very open. There is, of course, some
                    back room dealing, but, by and large, Israeli politics are quite open. It is
                    quite a contest. Israelis are quite willing to talk to foreigners, particularly
                    if they take the trouble to learn Hebrew and already know a good deal on the
                    subject. They are delighted to talk about the political situation and give their
                    views and their opponents' views. If an Israeli—a senior Israeli figure, for
                    that matter—had seen what we were reporting a) he would not have had any major
                    disagreement with its accuracy and b) he certainly would not have had any
                    question about our motivation. We were simply trying to describe what was
                    happening and analyze where things might go. I had four or five political
                    officers. Most of them were working on different segments of the Israeli
                    internal scene. At least initially, I concentrated on Israeli external affairs.
                    The Israelis had lost their relationship with most African countries, thanks to
                    the 1967 War, but they still had diplomatic relations with some African
                    countries and a lot of Asian countries. They had an interesting relationship
                    with West European countries and North America. It was interesting to get the
                    Israeli perspective, not only on the Israeli bilateral relationship with those
                    countries but the Israeli perception of where things were heading in the
                    European Community—remember, this was 20 years ago—and to get the Israeli view
                    of economic developments in North America and East Asia.</p>
                <p>It was interesting. So I reported this stuff with considerable care. What else
                    can I tell you? The one member of our Political Section who might have gotten
                    the Israelis' dander up, who spoke both Hebrew and Arabic, Wat Cluverius,
                    covered the occupied territories beat and also Israeli domestic Arab population
                    developments. You realize that there are almost one million Arabs who were born
                    in Israel and are Israeli citizens. They have become a real problem. At that
                    time those people were not disaffected. They were quite loyal [to Israel]. We
                    tried to stay in touch with them. We certainly wanted to know what was going on
                    in that community. We never did anything that any Israeli had any right to be
                    suspicious of. But if they were going to be suspicious of anything that the
                    Political Section did, it would have been our relationships with Israeli Arabs
                    and especially with those from the West Bank and Gaza. And we also took turns
                    visiting the West Bank and Gaza. My wife and children and I would go down every
                    three to six months and stay in the Gaza Strip which, at that time, it was
                    possible to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the West Bank? We've talked about the
                        relationship in reporting with our Consulate General in Jerusalem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH: The West Bank [of the Jordan River] was part of Jerusalem's consular
                    district. You are quite right. The Embassy also tried to understand what was
                    going on in the West Bank area, not for reporting purposes, since it was
                    Jerusalem's prerogative, but more so that we would understand what the Israelis
                    were talking about, when they referred to their problems on the West Bank. I am
                    glad you reminded me of that. The Consulate General in Jerusalem then—and, I am
                    sure, still today—is responsible for reporting on internal developments on the
                    West Bank. The Gaza Strip was the Embassy's responsibility. I do not know
                    whether that division of labor continues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To the extent that the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians
                    in the West Bank can do anything in unison, which is somewhat doubtful, then it
                    makes sense for one U.S. post to do the reporting. These were relatively calm
                    times in Israel—those last two years before the outbreak of the so-called “Yom
                    Kippur War” in October 1973. As I said at the outset, this was an economically
                    vibrant time. The Israeli economy just grew like Topsy during that period. It
                    was a good time to be there. Naturally, it led astray those of us who had only
                    been in Israel during those two years. We found that out, as the Israelis
                    themselves did, when it all came a cropper in October 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon the Likud Party, Menachem Begin, and
                        his supporters at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We did not take them very seriously. We did maintain some contact with
                    them. In fact, to my amusement, people whom I had for dinner in my home ended up
                    by being members of the Israeli cabinet during the several years that the Likud
                    Party was in power. The betting was that the Likud Party was not going to be
                    able to come to power any time soon. As you recall, it was not until 1977 that
                    Likud came to power for the first time in the history of Israel. So we certainly
                    paid attention to the opposition and kept track of them. One of my political
                    officers used to say, partly with tongue in cheek but not entirely so, that it
                    might be a better thing for both the United States and Israel if Likud did come
                    to power.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The Labor Party was, first of all, in its heart of hearts, ambivalent about the
                    [efforts to achieve peace between Arabs and Israelis] that we were forever
                    promoting. Labor was dubious that peace, in fact, could be made with the Arabs.
                    However, the Labor Party was clever about sounding “reasonable” on these issues
                    and sounding as if it were ready to compromise, if only given the chance.
                    Because the Labor Party was so sophisticated, the United States would listen to
                    its advice and would sometimes compromise efforts that we were trying to make to
                    accommodate their views. In fact, to some extent we were emasculated. This
                    [political] officer's thesis was that if Likud ever came to power, it would
                    “come right out with it” and would articulate the fears that the Labor Party
                    also had about peacemaking and the future. They would call a spade a spade. And
                    then the United States would have “to get off the dime,” if we ever did get to a
                    situation where we had our hands on a balanced compromise with the Arabs as a
                    possibility. If the Israelis tried to walk out of it, we would have to put some
                    real body pressure to Israel. It would have been a hard thing for us to bring
                    ourselves to do with Labor, this officer argued, whereas with a Likud
                    [government], if that moment ever came, it would be so abrasive that it would
                    not be so hard for the United States to do what it had to do.</p>
                <p>In reality, to his everlasting credit, President Carter personally persuaded
                    Menachem Begin that the Sinai deal and the interim arrangement for the West Bank
                    and Gaza were in Israel's interest. I know that Begin had tremendous misgivings
                    [about these arrangements], but, by dint of sheer personality, I think that
                    Jimmy Carter turned the leader of the Likud movement into a supporter of the
                    Camp David arrangements. So it never did come to a question of push and shove
                    between the United States and Israel.</p>
                <p>However, there was plenty of pushing and shoving between the United States and
                    Israel during the period in office of Secretary of State Kissinger, just to get
                    the Israelis to agree to those two disengagement agreements: one with Egypt and
                    one with Syria, and then the second agreement with Egypt. There should have been
                    an agreement with Jordan while there was a chance. Kissinger knew that, but that
                    would have been very tough to carry out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sitting there, reading an awful lot of the
                        telegrams coming out of Egypt, Jordan, and Damascus—I mean, from our
                        Embassies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We did not even have a U.S.-staffed Interests Section in Damascus from the
                    1967 war until after the 1973 war.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SMITH: You were getting two different perspectives. Even pro-Arab people who may
                    have served in Tel Aviv—and there have not been many because most people who
                    have been assigned to Tel Aviv, no matter what their background—have been, as I
                    was, rather fascinated by the Israeli people and sympathetic to the perceived
                    Israeli plight. Anyhow, you were getting two perspectives. We, naturally, even
                    when we did not fully agree with the Israeli point of view, tried to report
                    accurately and sympathetically, with the thought in mind that Washington could
                    never do its job if it did not hear both sides of the argument. Obviously, our
                    colleagues in the Arab countries were reporting with some degree of skepticism
                    regarding current Arab points of view on the same issues. But we never got into
                    “pissing” matches between Foreign Service personnel reporting on Arab politics
                    and those reporting on Israeli politics.</p>
                <p>We knew many of the individuals concerned. There were occasional regional get
                    togethers of reporting officers in Cyprus, covering this area. I think that that
                    only happened once in my time. That was enormously helpful. In the past it had
                    happened that the American Embassy in Cairo and the American Embassy in Tel Aviv
                    engaged in a “feud,” if you will. There was a danger of friction between the
                    reporting sections of the Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Consulate General in
                    Jerusalem, which has always tended to be quite unfriendly to the Israelis and
                    sympathetic to the Palestinians. That is the job of the Consulate General in
                    Jerusalem. Our colleagues in Jerusalem sometimes seemed to feel that the deck
                    was so heavily stacked against the Palestinians that they were fighting an
                    uphill battle. That was not necessarily the case. We would sometimes call them
                    up and say, “You have got to realize that your reporting [on some particular
                    issue] is not entirely accurate. We do not want to point that out in a telegram
                    to Washington, but we want you to reconsider what you are saying on this
                    particular issue.” That sometimes helped, but it sometimes did not. The greatest
                    danger was to have a feud going on between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</p>

                <p>SMITH: It was Golda Meir, right up to shortly before my departure in 1974. She
                    finally stepped down, and Rabin became Prime Minister—in the spring of 1974.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Golda Meir was a very impressive personality, a very strong willed person,
                    tough as nails but tired, a fine brain—not a very refined person but a very
                    intricate, competent person. My Hebrew was not good enough to tell whether she
                    had an atrocious American accent in her Hebrew, but she must have had, because
                    her English had the strongest Milwaukee accent that you have ever heard. It must
                    have made those who speak British-accented English wince to hear her talk. Just
                    as, I gather, Abba Eban had a rather British accent in his Hebrew. As he was an
                    intellectual, I gather that he spoke a rather purist, classical Hebrew, which
                    made people chuckle when they heard him on the radio. Golda Meir was just as
                    tough as nails.</p>
                <p>The 1973 War threw her for a real loop because she had so completely failed to
                    anticipate it. Just after that war Kissinger said—how did he put it? It was
                    clever. He said that the Israelis had “brain-washed themselves” [convinced
                    themselves] that the Arabs were incapable of launching a surprise, coordinated
                    attack on Israel. And then the Israelis turned around and “brain-washed us” into
                    thinking the same thing. That is exactly what happened.</p>

                        their whole story?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I do not think so. Most of the people serving on the attach� staffs were
                    very much impressed by the Israeli military. They were amazed by the ability of
                    Israel, working with such comparatively limited resources, compared to our own,
                    to pull off such extraordinary feats—in all three branches, but especially in
                    the air. They were impressed, but they were not captives of the Israeli point of
                    view because, I think, all of them—before coming to Israel—had worked on the
                    military dimensions of the Middle East problem. If anything, they tended to be
                    very uncomfortable about the ability of Israel to get in the way of Pentagon
                    planning for “the big show”—namely, dealing with the Soviets. In terms of
                    U.S.-Soviet rivalry, Israel has never been an asset. Israel has always been a
                    liability. Nobody ever dared say this, but it is just a fact.</p>
                <p>If you look at it very carefully, you will see why I say this. The Israelis had
                    tremendous military capabilities, but they would not be of any major value in
                    stopping the Soviets. They certainly were capable of getting into a tremendous
                    ruckus with the Arabs which could provide a beautiful opening for the Soviets to
                    come into the area. As we were saying in the last interview, that was beginning
                    to happen along the Suez Canal in 1969 and 1970. Fortunately, Joe Sisco turned
                    that off, just in time. The Israeli and Soviet pilots were shooting each other
                    down. That created really serious problems for the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>So the military attach�s we had in Israel really worked. They were pressed
                    professionally by their Israeli counterparts. Of course, they liked them as
                    human beings, but they were also worried about Israel's ability inadvertently to
                    cause huge defense problems for the United States.</p>
                <p>The CIA people were not reporting on Israel during that time. I do not know
                    whether that is still the case or not. They had an understanding with the
                    Israelis that they would not report or conduct covert operations in Israel. They
                    exchanged views with the Israelis on Arab problems and so they were not, really,
                    part of the equation.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>What else could I mention? The FBI briefly had a Legal Attach� in Tel Aviv who,
                    at one point, under instructions, began to report back to Washington without
                    running his reports by the DCM. The DCM, who was charg� d'affaires at the time,
                    wrestled with [the Legal Attach�] and “forced” the State Department to wrestle
                    with the Justice Department, and he won. The Legal Attach� was required, when
                    requested, to show his reporting to the charg�. That was the time when my
                    already high opinion of Owen Zurhellen went way up. Zurhellen had absolutely
                    nothing to gain from this and possibly a great deal to lose, but to him it was a
                    matter of principle. It is the kind of principle the State Department has always
                    tried to sweep under the rug when, in fact, if it is going to carry out its
                    charter and responsibility as the “umbrella organization overseas,” it has got
                    to fight for its rights. Pardon the digression.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, I think that it's important. Tell me, how did the

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I did not expect it any more than anyone else did. During the 10 days
                    leading up to the outbreak the military attach� went in, under instructions,
                    with a warning [that war might be imminent]. The Israelis laughed. Then the
                    [CIA] Chief of Station went in to talk with his counterpart, under instructions,
                    with a warning that we were afraid that [an Arab attack] might be coming. The
                    Israelis laughed. The military attach� went back in again. Then, without
                    instructions, I went in and talked with the head of the Arab Affairs Division of
                    the Foreign Ministry and said, “I am afraid, not based on what my military
                    colleagues are saying, but just from my reading of the tea leaves, that
                    something very serious may be in the offing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you getting this? In the first place, was it
                        intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: A few smart people in Washington began reading things right. I should not
                    say 10 days—probably a week before the war broke out, because the Egyptian
                    preparations for the war took longer than a week. In fact, [both Egyptians and
                    Israelis] were engaged in major maneuvers near the demarcation line
                    when—bang!—the war began. In retrospect it was a major intelligence failure, not
                    only on the part of Israel—but also on the part of the United States—not to have
                    been able to say, 72 hours ahead of time, that there was no question about what
                    was going to happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Ambassador Keating and Nick Veliotes, the DCM, arrived on post just as I got back
                    from home leave in August 1973. I remember accompanying Ambassador Keating down
                    to the Suez Canal about three to four weeks after he arrived in September 1973,
                    less than a month before war broke out. The Egyptians had, if I remember, 35,000
                    troops on their side. The Israelis had 900 troops on their side. The Israelis
                    delighted in showing us how they could cover the whole Suez Canal line with 900
                    men. It turned out that they could not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bar Lev Line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. The Bar Lev Line. It was a masterful piece of
                    fortification, very carefully thought through, with all kinds of intricate
                    electronic warning devices. But the Egyptians, to their credit, breached the
                    line within the first 24 hours, I think. Then the Egyptians were so amazed at
                    their success—and the same thing happened to the Syrians on the Golan
                    Heights—that they stood there in disbelief, when they should have been moving
                    fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, now, the attack starts. Was the Embassy [in Tel Aviv]
                        ready for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, nobody was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you all doing? Tell me what you thought about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was sitting at home, working on an Arab-Israeli peace plan of my own,
                    when Nick Veliotes came by at about 2:00 PM on Saturday and said, “The balloon
                    has gone up, and I can not believe it.” He said, “Walter, come with me, the
                    balloon has gone up.” Off we went to the Embassy. We were there for about three
                    days. We did not remember to bring any change of clothes, but we stayed for
                    about three days, sleeping maybe two hours a night. Then he and I, and a couple
                    of others, started taking turns, going home and getting a decent night's sleep.
                    There was not anything we could do except report on what the Israelis were
                    saying about the war. We did that quite methodically. Needless to say, the
                    communications ear in Washington turned to the Middle East at that point. There
                    were virtually no limits on our reporting in terms of quantity. We reported
                    every single Israeli announcement and also reported on the mood in Israel, to
                    the extent that we could plumb that. We were terribly worried for Israel's
                    sake.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I remember the first night—the night the war broke out—Veliotes and I and some
                    others were working almost all night long. We never thought of closing the
                    blinds on our Embassy windows facing the Mediterranean Sea. That was the only
                    night when Egyptian aircraft got close enough to Tel Aviv that they could
                    actually see the city. They lobbed some missiles at Tel Aviv which missed. Had
                    they struck Tel Aviv, it would have been so psychologically upsetting to the
                    Israelis that I do not know what would have happened. Had they struck Tel Aviv,
                    the fact that the American Embassy was lit up like a Christmas tree, without any
                    blinds drawn, might have contributed to their accuracy. From the next night on
                    we had a little sense and we pulled down our blinds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling, at that particular time, that if
                        it really reached a certain point, the Israelis would go for nuclear weapons
                        or did we believe that they had nuclear weapons then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Somebody may have known—but I did not know. I doubt that the Ambassador or
                    the DCM knew whether the Israelis had nuclear weapons or not. There was no
                    question that they could assemble a nuclear weapon on very short notice—and
                    maybe they started doing that during that war [the 1973 war]. I do not know. I
                    was not concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It can come almost by word of mouth, whether it's true or
                        not. But was it accepted at the time—was it the accepted wisdom within the
                        Embassy—that the Israelis had a nuclear capability that could be used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The folk wisdom within the Embassy at that time was that the Israelis were
                    within one to four weeks of assembling a nuclear weapon, if they decided to go
                    that way. They had the know-how and the technology, but [it was believed within
                    the Embassy that] they had not done it. They did not have them [nuclear weapons]
                    stored. I do not know whether that was true, but it was the folk wisdom within
                    the Embassy at the time. That war lasted over three weeks, as I remember. They
                    [the Israelis] may very well have assembled a bomb in the course of the war. It
                    was not something which, during the first two or three days of the war, we
                    thought could be just around the corner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were experiencing the mood of the place and
                        you were at the Embassy all of that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SMITH: Toward the end of the war, we were not [always at the Embassy]. I had four
                    or five political officers whom I could send out. Veliotes [the DCM] and I were
                    at the Embassy all of the time, but the other reporting officers were fanned
                    out, to the extent that they could locate their Israeli contacts—usually the
                    wives of the contacts, as the contacts [themselves] were at the front.</p>
                <p>It really is an impressive thing to see mobilization in Israel. It is no laughing
                    matter. The postal service stops and the garbage collection stops because
                    everybody is at the front—and I mean everybody. The street in front of our house
                    in Herzliyya Pituach, the suburb north of Tel Aviv where virtually all of the
                    married Embassy officers had their houses, was a troop collection point. My wife
                    and our then teenage daughters ran a soup kitchen during those days to help feed
                    these reservists who had been called up and were waiting and living on trucks,
                    waiting to be told to go south or north. It was a very nerve-wracking time for
                    them [the reservists], of course. My wife talked with them fairly
                    extensively.</p>
                <p>As I recall, it was three days before they finally got orders and were sent to
                    the Sinai front. They got two-thirds of the way down there and then were sent
                    north to the Golan Heights. They passed by again—that was how we knew this. They
                    stopped for a couple of hours of rest and then proceeded north to the Golan
                    Heights. So Israel was expecting a much bigger problem in the south than in the
                    north. If you look at the map, the distance from the Golan Heights to Tel Aviv
                    is [nearly] nothing. The distance to the Suez Canal is quite substantial. They
                    had to forget about what they wanted to do in Sinai initially in order to plug
                    the hole on the Golan Heights, because the Syrians really broke through. As we
                    were saying a while ago, the Syrians simply stopped instead of pushing on. They
                    could have pushed into Israel proper with no difficulty. This was at the end of
                    the first day and a half or so. But they [the Syrians] did not do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Ambassador, Kenneth Keating? He was brand
                        new. He had been an ambassador in India, but he was getting on in

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He was indeed getting on in years. He became very emotional, to the point
                    where he was taking up a fair amount of Nick Veliotes' time, because he was
                    getting downright irrational. He had been a colonel during World War II, and he
                    was so moved by the situation that he said to Veliotes, I am sorry to say, in
                    deathly earnest, that he was going to go and volunteer in the Israeli Army.</p>

                    from doing or saying something irrational. He was a minus in this situation. May
                    he rest in peace.</p>

                <p>SMITH: You asked a good question, which I did not do justice to: what was the
                    feeling of the Embassy at the end of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War [the Yom Kippur
                    war]. I said that that is the same thing as discussing the disengagement
                    agreements, which is what [Secretary of State] Kissinger was getting into. But,
                    naturally, people who had spent, at that point, at least a year and, in several
                    cases, two or three years in Israel, felt out of the big picture. I believe that
                    those of us in the Embassy in Tel Aviv in late October 1973 had the same
                    instincts that Middle East watchers had in 1967—for a different set of reasons,
                    of course. That is, is there not some way to make this the Arab-Israeli War that
                    ends all [such] wars?</p>
                <p>We recognized the main theme of Kissinger's diplomacy toward the end of the war,
                    which was to make sure that Israel, in effect, won the war and, at the same
                    time, to leave a sense of honor with Israel's Arab adversaries, as the Arabs
                    were forever putting it. So that they would not [appear to have] lost face and
                    make sure, in other words, that Israel would not appear to have “trounced” them
                    at the very end of the war as, indeed, Israel might have been able to do. The
                    Arabs could thus summon the political courage finally to get into some serious
                    negotiations with Israel. I must say, to Kissinger's full credit, he did end the
                    war in a way which left the Israeli public dismayed and disgruntled, but not
                    totally depressed. The depression which was palpable in Israel was not related
                    so much to the way the war ended but to the fact that the war had broken out in
                    the first place, despite all of the predictions on the part of every responsible
                    Israeli that no such war was conceivable. That war really took Israel by
                    surprise. That alone is an interesting subject which we can not take the time to
                    go into now.</p>
                <p>There was, indeed, an enormous feeling, not so much of desperation, but
                    depression in Israel. It was primarily focused on the fact that Israel had not
                    ended the war with a resounding defeat of the enemy, which was therefore
                    unfavorable from the point of view of negotiations. So that was the big picture:
                    how can that [the outcome] be crafted into some kind of lasting settlement? And
                    we all felt rather elated that the war ended the way it did, and Kissinger, who
                    had had a very limited attitude toward the Arab-Israeli problem, had become an
                    instant expert and was going to be Secretary of State for at least a year or two
                    longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, as an Embassy officer, and others in the Embassy
                        as well, taking any heat from “important” Israelis because they felt that we
                        had stopped them from going to Damascus and Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SMITH: Not from “important” Israelis. There were demonstrations outside the
                    American Embassy—rather nasty, potentially violent ones. There were a few
                    windows broken. So there was anger at the United States. I do not think that it
                    was focused on the alleged U.S. “responsibility” for stopping the Israeli forces
                    before they could do a proper job. As I remember it, it had to do with a
                    misunderstanding on the part of Israeli public opinion with respect to prisoners
                    of war. Kissinger crafted an exchange of prisoners of war, knowing how important
                    this was to Israeli public opinion. It was fair and reasonable. It was
                    misrepresented, as I recall—and this gets a little hazy in my memory—in the
                    Israeli press. Some Israeli young people believed a false story that the
                    Americans had deliberately “delayed” the release of Israeli prisoners in order
                    to gain some negotiating advantage. I think that was the only cause for violence
                    against us in Tel Aviv at the end of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're trying to keep this as much focused on the Embassy
                        and you, particularly. The war ended. What were you all doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Kissinger's first “shuttle” began before the war ended. It entailed
                    zigzagging between Tel Aviv, Moscow, Damascus, and Cairo to pull off a
                    cease-fire. This I remember well. He did not come to Tel Aviv. While in Cairo he
                    sent Joe Sisco to Tel Aviv, which bothered some Israelis. It should not have,
                    because, as Kissinger rightly put it in a confidential message to the Israelis,
                    he knew that the Israelis knew him and could trust him, whereas the Arabs did
                    not trust him at all. That was why he was “stroking” the Egyptians in
                    particular, as well as the Syrians, and letting Joe Sisco talk to the Israelis.
                    It was not an untenable proposition. You can not do everything
                    simultaneously.</p>
                <p>My admiration for Sisco, which was already high, went up still higher because the
                    man a) understood what Kissinger wanted and got it done; and b) did not hesitate
                    to “buck” Kissinger when he thought he was wrong. I just got a glimpse of this
                    Sisco, who was with us only about 24 hours in Tel Aviv at that point.</p>
                <p>Your question was, “What was the Embassy doing at that time?” It was supporting
                    this kind of frenzied activity on the part of the Secretary of State or the
                    Under Secretary of State, which was quite demanding. We did not have a big
                    Political Section. We wound up by lassoing our colleagues from the Consular,
                    Economic, and Administrative Sections to keep the place covered, because there
                    had to be “round the clock” officer coverage by all possible means, on behalf of
                    our visitors.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Let us see now. This was the end of October 1973. Kissinger was back by the end
                    of November 1973 for a shuttle visit and for another shuttle visit in early
                    December 1973. There was a lot of shuttling. I do not know how any other U.S.
                    business got transacted in that period of time. In January 1974 he stayed almost
                    a whole month in Egypt, if you will recall, to nail down the first disengagement
                    agreement. The agreements between the end of the war at the end of October 1973
                    and the beginning of the negotiations leading to the first Egyptian-Israeli
                    disengagement agreement, reached in early January were several. The agreements
                    had to do with troop disengagement and prisoner of war exchange. Both of these
                    agreements were extremely important, especially the troop disengagement
                    agreement. You will recall that the map of the situation on the Egyptian
                    front—and also on the Syrian front—was not to be believed. There were “pockets”
                    of Egyptian and Israeli soldiers deep behind the other party's lines. How to
                    straighten this out while assuring the two belligerents that they were not
                    giving up anything of consequence and that a straightened line did not lose them
                    any negotiating or military advantage—that was not a simple matter. On the other
                    hand they could not possibly feed the troop pockets, especially the
                    Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the whole [Egyptian] Third Army sitting out
                        there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The [Egyptian] Third Army was an obvious sore thumb, but there were little
                    bits and pieces of Egyptian units elsewhere, too, in extended and unsupportable
                    locations. And there were Israeli [troops] in unsupportable locations behind the
                    Egyptian lines. So that kept us busy.</p>
                <p>The Geneva Middle East Peace “Conference”</p>
                <p>I was summoned back to Washington by [Under Secretary of State] Joe Sisco on
                    December 30, 1973, as was Bob Oakley, who was my counterpart as chief of the
                    Political Section in Beirut. That was done because [Secretary of State]
                    Kissinger, as you may recall, at the peace or non-peace conference in December
                    1973 (which the Syrians, at the last moment, refused to attend), created the
                    illusion of an ongoing peace conference after he and the other principal
                    [figures] left. I do not know whether he appreciated its value at the time,
                    though he did very quickly after that, but this was a device to keep the Soviets
                    somewhat distracted by implying an important [degree of] collaboration with the
                    United States. It gave [the Soviets] a place of seeming prominence, namely, in
                    Geneva. It was a way of keeping them out of his hair as he dealt with the
                    parties concerned. To do this, he had to have somebody, some ostensible interim
                    or acting chief of the U.S. Delegation in Geneva. That was why Oakley and I were
                    summoned back to Washington on December 31, 1973, given our marching orders, and
                    sent initially, with Mike Sterner, to Geneva to be a “pretend” U.S. Delegation
                    to the non-existent Middle East Peace Conference, at which the Soviets had their
                    former ambassador to Egypt and Iran as our counterpart.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Sterner was by now a Deputy Assistant Secretary. So there was at least a smidgen
                    of Soviet face-saving in having Sterner there. But Sterner only stayed for a
                    week. I had a wonderful time with Sterner in Geneva. Sterner and I went to
                    school together. Oakley had gone back to Beirut, and from that point, until the
                    end of April 1974, Oakley and I took turns, leaving our posts in the Middle East
                    to go and sit for two weeks [at a time in Geneva].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you told that this is what you were doing or were you
                        given something to do but not much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was self-evident why we were doing what we were doing. And we were
                    given absolutely nothing to do. We were told not to leave Geneva either. One
                    weekend I did go down to Monaco to see an old friend who lives there. I did this
                    with some apprehension, I might add, because even on the weekends we were
                    supposed to be there, in Geneva, and visible to the Soviets and on call, for the
                    Soviets or for Washington, whoever wanted to be in touch with us. The Israelis,
                    at Kissinger's insistence, kept a delegation there, too. I happened to know the
                    Israeli delegates. They were Foreign Ministry people who were as frustrated as I
                    was at this fiction. That is what I was doing [during the period] from January
                    to April 1974. In fact, my two sons were scheduled to be confirmed at St.
                    George's Anglican Cathedral in Jerusalem in April 1974. Because, as often
                    happened, I had no travel orders, I finally telephoned Roy Atherton from Geneva
                    and said, “Please see if I can't go back to Israel for this coming weekend, to
                    be present at my sons' confirmation.” And Roy arranged it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviet delegation that was there [in
                        Geneva]? What were you doing [with them]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Soviets were sore with their delegation head Vinogradov, who had
                    botched things recently as Ambassador to Egypt. They were using [this occasion
                    to “punish” him]. They were not stupid. They figured out what Kissinger was up
                    to and were very frustrated. I think that Kissinger met with his Soviet
                    counterpart at some point, somewhere in Western Europe, to “stroke him” and pick
                    his brains, so that the Soviets could continue the masquerade of major power
                    collaboration for their own people. I do not know how we figured out that the
                    Soviets wanted to “punish” their ambassador, but there was no question that this
                    was the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you have to be “punished,” Geneva was not the
                        worst place in the world to go. It could have been Khartoum [Sudan] or some
                        place like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is true. We would go and call on this Soviet ambassador every third
                    day or so, just so that he would know [that we were there]. We had nothing to
                    say. We had to “invent” things to say to him. In fact, he was a likable man.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>That takes us up to the spring of 1974, and then, of course, Kissinger began his
                    Syrian shuttle—about the time we wound down this silly exercise. Actually, after
                    I left Geneva, Bob Oakley had to continue to hang around there for several more
                    weeks. As I remember it, this began in April or May, 1974.</p>

                <p>SMITH: [President] Nixon, of course, was on his last legs. We had Nixon's grand

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. To emphasize his strong point of foreign affairs,
                    [President Nixon] made a very high profile visit to several of the major Middle
                    Eastern capitals. I think [he visited] Egypt, Israel, Syria, Jordan, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Israel when he came through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did [the visit] go? Because it was my understanding
                        that everyone knew that this was a dying, a failing presidency. Did it come
                        across that way where you were—or how [did it look]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SMITH: In fairness to Nixon, he comes off very well when overseas. I had seen him
                    in action when I was his escort officer in the Soviet Union in 1967 for two or
                    three weeks. He has a lot of dignity and wit about him in a foreign situation.
                    He thrives on that, too. He held his head up high, at least when he was in
                    Israel. I am sure it was much more of a dilemma for the Israelis than for the
                    Arabs because, when push comes to shove, Israel depends very much on its
                    “special relations” with the White House—not with Congress and obviously not
                    with the State Department. So the Israelis were hoping against hope that Nixon,
                    who had proved himself, on the whole, to be a good friend to them would survive.
                    They did not want to see an interim president. So the Israelis were nervous
                    about the Watergate business. The [Nixon] visit came off very well in Israel.
                    Nixon said the right things, he paid the proper courtesy calls, he did not have
                    an impulse to do anything zany. We got him in and out of there. He got enormous,
                    positive coverage in the Israeli media, as I am sure he did in the Arab media,
                    too. It was the first time a president of the United States had visited any of
                    those countries.</p>
                <p>The ability of Israel to absorb the enormity of its miscalculation in the
                    outbreak of the [1973] war in the first place really occupied us in terms of our
                    reporting on the Israeli domestic scene. In addition to that, there was a crisis
                    within the Israeli government. As you may recall, Golda Meir was interim prime
                    minister for about five months. Finally, Rabin became prime minister when she
                    stepped down. She had already resigned but she was required, under the Israeli
                    constitution, to stay in office until a certain point. And then Rabin became
                    Prime Minister in the spring of 1974.</p>
                <p>This was a unique situation. It had never happened before that Israel had a
                    caretaker Prime Minister who had the courage, bless her, to sign the agreements
                    on the cease-fire, the prisoner of war [exchanges], the straightening out of the
                    line [of contact between the Israeli and the Egyptian armies], and the
                    disengagement with Egypt. I think she was still in office at the time the
                    agreement on the disengagement with Syria was negotiated. I think she was
                    already a caretaker Prime Minister at the end of the war. She signed these
                    agreements. That was because of the tremendous moral authority that Golda Meir
                    had in Israel. Since then, Israel has had caretaker prime ministers who have
                    been scared of their shadows, because they really did not have the
                    constitutional authority to do that kind of thing. So we got away with murder in
                    terms of the Israeli domestic political situation at that time, thank
                    goodness.</p>
                <p>Anonymous Backstopping of Kissinger in Washington</p>
                <p>So back I came from Israel, at the end of July, 1974. I was sitting at my desk in
                    Tel Aviv one day, and exactly one day later, I was sitting at my desk in the
                    State Department as Director of Israeli and Arab-Israeli Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served from when to when...</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SMITH: From July 1974, until July 1978, a very interesting period. Kissinger was
                    there—let me get this right—for the first two of those years. Then [I served
                    under] Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. Yes, Kissinger stayed on, did he not, as
                    Secretary of State under President Gerald Ford?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I cannot recall whether it was because Kissinger or Sisco asked for it,
                    but those of us at the working level knew that it was the logical thing: I threw
                    myself with a frenzy into writing a series of papers in July, August, and
                    September 1974, explaining how he should try to pull off a so-called
                    disengagement between Israel and Jordan, even though there had been no combat
                    between Israel and Jordan. Kissinger instantly recognized the desirability, if
                    we could manage it, of persuading the Israelis to pull back from a token portion
                    of the West Bank. [If this were done] we would strengthen the hand of the
                    Jordanians as possible spokesmen for the Palestinians. If we did not do this, in
                    rapid fire order in the summer of 1974, then [Yasser] Arafat and the PLO
                    [Palestine Liberation Organization] would be institutionalized [as the
                    representatives of the Palestinians], which is precisely what did happen, I
                    think it was in November 1974, at the Arab League Summit meeting. After this
                    King Hussein [of Jordan] just washed his hands and said, [in effect], “I can no
                    longer negotiate an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank on behalf of the
                    Palestinians. I have been rejected.” This greatly complicated the political life
                    of the United States in the area.</p>
                <p>Through Joe Sisco, I did get a backhanded compliment from Henry Kissinger. I
                    guess it was just before the Nixon resignation. [In effect Kissinger reportedly
                    said that] all of this makes eminent sense, but the White House is so weak and
                    is going to be so weak for such a protracted period of time that he [Kissinger]
                    could not pull this off from a U.S. domestic political standpoint. He sent that
                    word to me, which was the closest thing I ever got to a compliment from him.
                    Kissinger also said, “For once the State Department people are writing a paper
                    that takes all aspects of the problem into account.” I had looked at Kissinger's
                    own writing and now saw papers relating to the disengagement efforts up until
                    then, the summer of 1974, and recognized that Kissinger did not want a simple
                    analysis of what the smartest thing would be to say to the Israelis and, in this
                    case, King Hussein and what the carrots and sticks for the parties should be. He
                    wanted to know what would be happening in Algeria, what would be the ability of
                    the Algerians to undercut King Hussein, what would be happening in Western
                    Europe, what would the Soviets be up to—you know, the global [perspective]. It
                    was not that hard to do. It was not our style in the Department at the time [to
                    do this kind of thing].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, just to give me a feel [for the situation]. Here
                        you are, as the Arab-Israeli desk officer, and you're thinking of what would

                        treading on all sorts of toes. How do you handle this? Do you call up and
                        ask? This is sort of a nuts and bolts question. How would you go about
                        it?</hi>

                <p>SMITH: I do not remember whether I ever cleared the various sections of my action
                    memorandum to Kissinger with the desks concerned. If it had not been urgent,
                    obviously, I would have done so, as I should have. I am not sure if I did. It
                    was not a profound study. I simply put myself in—who was it?—Boumedienne's
                    position [as President of Algeria]. I was vaguely aware of what the Algerians
                    had been [accustomed to] saying about King Hussein and I had paid close
                    attention to what they had done and said about the Arab-Israeli problem since
                    the [1973] war had ended. We had been talking with the leaders of the entire
                    region, and so I kept track of them in the EXDIS telegrams. Simply on the basis
                    of the existing short record, I extrapolated what they would probably do in this
                    case and came up with suggestions which may have been faulty but looked obvious
                    to me of things that we could do or at least say to the Algerians to keep them
                    quiet—little hints of future U.S. favors in other contexts. I am sure I did not
                    clear this with the Algerian desk officer because he would have wanted to make a
                    Ph.D. thesis out of it, and there was not time. Also, it was sketchy. It was not
                    a prediction to Kissinger of what would happen. It was a scenario suggesting
                    that this was what might happen, and this was a possible way to contain these
                    actors on the margins who could disrupt what you wanted to do otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're really talking about is the [widespread]
                        complaint that the State Department can't produce [such studies] because,
                        even if you wanted a thumb-nail sketch of what Algeria and the Soviet Union
                        [would do], by the time you get it [cleared] you get a tome...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Or if you do not get a tome, you get a wishy-washy [study]...</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It is better to have [such a paper] done in effective, real time than to
                    belabor the points. But you can make major errors. The point of this paper was
                    that it was not a rigid scenario, under which Kissinger was going to move, step
                    by step. It was simply a picture. Kissinger would fill in the picture as he went
                    along. He was going to “ad hoc” it from day to day, anyhow. But it [the
                    memorandum] was to jog his memory on the fact that, if Kissinger made a public
                    statement about this or that aspect of King Hussein's role in relation to
                    Jerusalem or the West Bank, it would—I am just making this up—irritate the hell
                    out of Boumedienne, who had a propaganda machine in the Arab world to make life
                    horribly difficult for King Hussein. So [the idea was] that you do not go public
                    with this or that viewpoint, if you want to avoid riling the waters. This is the
                    kind of thing that we are talking about here.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Let me interrupt. That is a pre-1967 term. What it really meant was that
                    [I was] the Israel and Palestinian desk officer. The “Arab” part dealt only with
                    East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That was not the purpose of this desk at all. It was the desk for
                    Palestinians. It sounds as if it was a regional office operation. But the
                    Israeli desk—the Israel and Arab-Israeli desk—can not speak for any Arabs except
                    for those then under Israeli occupation and inside Israel before 1967. [In
                    fact], not under Israeli occupation but under Jordanian and Egyptian occupation,
                    but still intimately associated with the Israel problem, let us say. Namely, the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you must have been inundated with visitors and all
                        that, which must have taken an awful lot of your time. Could you turn them
                        aside, particularly Congressional visitors and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, but most prominent Americans considered themselves instant experts
                    before they even left, so they were not screaming for State Department
                    briefings. They knew it all, already. Furthermore, the Israeli Embassy [in
                    Washington] was happily giving them all kinds of briefings, and we would like to
                    have given [these visitors] what we considered the “straight” story, but, as you
                    have sensed, we could not stretch ourselves in that many directions at once. A
                    great deal of the Arab-Israeli stuff, regionally speaking, did, indeed, fall in
                    our laps. Somebody had to do it. NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs] did not
                    have regional offices any longer. Those had been scrapped when the country
                    directorate system was created. There was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
                    [DAS] for South Asia, another DAS for North Africa, and another DAS for the main
                    part of the Middle East. So we at least had a person with authority to deal with
                    these matters, and, starting a year later, it was Nick Veliotes who came back
                    from Tel Aviv, where he had been DCM, and took over this work.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Even though there was a deputy assistant secretary for the pieces of the NEA
                    region, because there was no office dealing with those pieces, some country
                    directorate within the Middle East would have to function, in effect, as a
                    [regional] office, as far as getting the papers together was concerned, making
                    sure that people all wrote their bits and pieces, and it all got assembled. That
                    fell to us. So we did have, in the 1974-76 period, quite a bit of regional
                    paperwork to do, if you will. We were stretched, then. Thank goodness, prominent
                    Americans wanting to go to Israel were not pounding at our door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Israeli lobby? Are we talking about this
                        time and its effect on you—AIPAC [American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee]
                        and you and the various issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I knew it well from back in December 1970, when the Israeli lobby went
                    berserk after [Secretary of State] Rogers' Peace Plan Section II, which dealt
                    with the West Bank and Jerusalem, came out. [The lobby] flooded the Executive
                    Branch [of the U.S. Government] with so much correspondence that normal
                    operations came to a halt. So I was familiar with all of this. There was a fair
                    amount of confusion in the [Israeli] lobby. There was no clear signal from
                    Israel to the lobby in 1974-75, and many prominent American supporters of Israel
                    recognized that Kissinger, even though he was having a lot of friction with
                    Israel, was displaying a lot of good sense in maneuvering in the Middle East. No
                    matter how little confidence the pro-Israeli lobby, like the Israeli Government,
                    had in Kissinger at the beginning of 1974, within four months he had pulled off
                    disengagement agreements with the two combatants, Egypt and Syria. The Syrian
                    disengagement [agreement], if you look at it carefully, was really extremely
                    difficult and a tour de force for which alone Kissinger deserved the Nobel Peace
                    Prize.</p>
                <p>Naturally, the American-Israeli lobby thought that we had a Secretary of State
                    who was not pounding on Israel and was displaying a lot of wisdom in what he was
                    doing—and was a real activist. Kissinger barely had time for anything else in
                    1974-75. Things slowed down a little bit in 1975 after the second
                    Egyptian-Israeli disengagement agreement, which was reached, if I remember
                    correctly, in September, 1975. The purpose of this agreement was to nail the
                    Israelis down. To do this, Kissinger made some very unfortunate commitments to
                    the Israelis, which plagued us later on, about what the U.S. would or would not
                    do in the future in pursuing Middle East peace efforts. He did not have to do
                    that. I do not know what made him think that he did. But that is getting a
                    little bit ahead of the story.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I do not know what else to say on this. The Israeli lobby was not a problem in
                    1974 or in 1975—at least not more than it always is for anybody in the State
                    Department trying to carry out U.S. Middle East policy. They were checking on
                    us. I spent a lot of time, as Director of Israeli Affairs, with major supporters
                    of Israel. I went to a lot of receptions, almost to a point above and beyond the
                    call of duty, to let them see me, talk to me, show them that this is the guy
                    who, at the working level, is responsible for Israel in the State Department.
                    Was this guy an Arab lover? Was he a Jew hater? They could see that I was not. I
                    think this did some good. Now that I think about it, I spent an inordinate
                    amount of time, not exactly stroking these people but just exposing myself to
                    them. I honestly think that this did some good. I got my staff—the FSOs [Foreign
                    Service Officers] working with me on that desk—to do the same thing. Then, as
                    things calmed down, in 1976-77, the NEA Office of Public Affairs “discovered” me
                    and put me into their speaking meat grinder. I spent about 25 percent of my time
                    traveling around the United States, talking about United States Middle Eastern
                    policy—as often as not in front of American Jewish groups of all stripes. And,
                    of course, academic and business groups and so forth. That was quite exhausting,
                    as I look back on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The various Jewish groups throughout the United States
                        have been such a major factor in our Middle Eastern policy, because they are
                        so politically powerful. Did you find yourself up against “true believers”
                        or did the people asking you questions have what I would call a “rational
                        approach” to the role of Israel at that particular time in the Middle
                        East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: On the whole, I was impressed with the degree of sophistication of
                    Israel's supporters in the American hinterland. I should not have been
                    surprised, because these people were: a) well educated, whether it was Des
                    Moines [Iowa] or Little Rock [Arkansas] or wherever I was. They were always
                    interested in international affairs, partly because of their attachment to
                    Israel but, I suspect, not only because of Israel. They were quite knowledgeable
                    about American foreign affairs. Also, they were very grateful to have somebody
                    come from the State Department and try to explain to them what the State
                    Department and the Secretary of State were seeking to do. The fact that we had a
                    dynamo for a Secretary of State, who was, by now, a proven friend of Israel and
                    also a very smart character in handling Israel and the Arabs—and who happened to
                    be Jewish—this was not lost on these people that I was dealing with. I sometimes
                    found myself dealing with blue collar, relatively ignorant, American Jewish
                    groups, who tended to be extremists in their belief or their willingness to
                    believe the cliches about how the State Department was the enemy of Israel. But
                    that did not happen often. On the whole, I found the American Jewish community
                    to be intelligent, perceptive, well informed, and willing to listen to somebody
                    from the State Department.</p>
                <p>It was a reassuring experience. The fact that I had just lived three years in
                    Israel, spoke a little Hebrew, and was not a “buddy” of the Arabs by any stretch
                    of the imagination did not hurt, naturally.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the change when the Carter administration
                        came in? Let's talk about the transition and that period. Here you
                        were—there was a new administration coming in, with Democrats coming in to
                        replace Republicans. This was a major issue. How were you treated or
                        perceived by the new people coming in and how did you deal with the
                        transition period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Every new administration brings in a bunch of political figures who think
                    that they know it all and push aside the career people. I know what you mean. As
                    far as the Jewish community is concerned, though, it is worth mentioning that
                    Nixon and Ford had been so weak that they were pleased to have a properly
                    elected president. Until Nixon the Democrats had seemed to be friendlier to
                    Israel than the Republicans. Nixon turned that idea on its head in the view of
                    the American Jewish community.</p>
                <p>This is an aside, but even though Nixon seems to be on record as having made some
                    extraordinarily anti-Semitic remarks, he nevertheless will go down in the
                    history of the American Jewish community as one of the most pro-Israeli
                    presidents that we have ever had. That is really what is called “squaring the
                    circle.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was a politician.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: But back to President Carter. The American Jewish community and the State
                    of Israel had no reason to think that Carter was not going to be a true friend
                    of Israel. But what made them nervous was the fact that—I do not know whether it
                    was [Zbigniew] Brzezinski or [Secretary of State] Vance or [President] Carter
                    himself who set something of a deadline to get back to a major effort toward a
                    total settlement in the Middle East, as opposed to these “piecemeal”
                    arrangements which Kissinger had concentrated on. I think that it was Vance who
                    did this, and he lived to rue the day, because he could not meet his own
                    schedule. So there was a great burst of Middle East consultations, travel by
                    Vance to Moscow, Western Europe, and to the Middle East, because he set a
                    deadline for reconvening the Middle East Peace Conference. I have got all of
                    this written down at home, because I wrote a paper on U.S. Middle Eastern peace
                    efforts from 1967 to 1982, which is about 250 pages long and which has never
                    been published.</p>
                <p>Vance made some gaffes early on which made him look much less sympathetic to
                    Israel than the facts justified. He made some statements on the eve of visiting
                    Arab capitals which made the Israelis nervous. But I do not think that the
                    Israelis were really worried about the Carter administration at all until the
                    Camp David negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Camp David was a bewildering event. The Camp David meetings took place just after
                    I had left the position of Director of Israeli and Arab-Israeli Affairs—in fact,
                    two months later. To me it was spellbinding. Some very good books have been
                    written about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the transition? I'm talking
                        about the teams that came in to look at things, or was that a fairly
                        professional transition, at least in the NEA area where you were
                        working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I do not recall any upheaval in NEA or with respect to the Middle East,
                    resulting from the change of administration, other than the rhetoric of the
                    incoming administration, spurning any further effort on partial arrangements and
                    calling for a major effort to go right to the fundamentals of the Middle East
                    peace problem. This looked very optimistic to us at the time, although Carter
                    had the will power, and Camp David was the result. No, I do not remember a
                    transition problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything that you can add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Vance, in my view, was one of the best Secretaries of State that we ever
                    had. He certainly went out of his way to consult the professionals [in the State
                    Department]. He was not abrasive with the career staff of the Department of
                    State. On the contrary, he relied heavily on career officers. So there was a
                    good working atmosphere within the Department after Vance took over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: My last year or year and a half—1977-78—in this position which we have
                    been talking about entailed more and more time spent on the road in public
                    speaking. This was partly because the Department needed me to do that and partly
                    because my office was not directly involved in those preliminary stages of
                    groping with the Middle East problem. Therefore, this was a good way to use me
                    and my time. I did not have a problem with this, other than the fact that it was
                    exhausting. To make a long story short, I do not think that there is anything
                    else that I was directly involved in during the 1977-78 time period which we
                    need to go into.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just another, quick question. What was your impression,
                        during the 1974-78 period, of the reporting from the Middle East? Because
                        now you were in a different position. You were looking at the reporting
                        coming from Cairo, Jordan, Beirut, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv. Did you have any
                        feel, at that particular time, [about the quality of] the information that
                        was coming from our posts in the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I recall that the reporting on the domestic political situation seemed to
                    me to be very good, even from capitals such as Damascus, where we had very
                    little access. I thought that it was impressive. On the Arab-Israeli problem, it
                    was of limited value, as long as Kissinger was Secretary of State, because he
                    was conducting it all “out of his hat.” There was no way for a reporting officer
                    in the field to have any true sense of what was likely to happen next in
                    Washington. Because Washington was the major player, not the local folks. But on
                    the domestic political scene, I thought that our reporting was darned good.</p>

                <p>SMITH: David Bohlen was my Ambassador during the first year. Herbert Okun was my
                    Ambassador for the next two and one-half years, and Roz [Rozanne] Ridgway was my
                    Ambassador during my last half year there. I was there for four years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a feel for the political situation in
                        East Germany at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SMITH: When I arrived, Ambassador Bohlen had made some headway in trying to
                    interest both the Executive Branch [of the U.S. Government] and American private
                    business groups in expanding U.S. economic relations with the East Germans. For
                    this he deserves some credit, because there had been a tendency for our
                    government to advise American businessmen on transactions with East Germany more
                    or less along the lines that the West Germans wanted. This enraged Ambassador
                    Bohlen, who thought that we had our own economic interests in East Germany.
                    Obviously, on the political front we would follow the West German lead, but
                    there was no reason in the world to forego commercial opportunities in East
                    Germany, only to see some West German firm come along and do the same thing six
                    months later. He saw that happen over and over again and he fought against it.
                    He was making considerable progress in moving the Executive Branch to favor a
                    liberalization of our trade restrictions—a very limited liberalization—vis-a-vis
                    East Germany.</p>
                <p>As you may recall, our trade restrictions in Eastern Europe varied enormously
                    during that period. The Poles were “good guys,” the Romanians were “moderately
                    good guys,” the Hungarians came next, and then everybody else was a “bad guy.”
                    This so-called [standard] by which we rewarded or punished the satellites,
                    depending on their willingness to act independently of Moscow, sounded very good
                    but did not work very well in practice. This whole strategy of trying to expand
                    U.S. trade relations with East Germany came crashing down when the Soviets
                    invaded Afghanistan...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Christmas, 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. And the U.S. Government put relations, not only with the
                    Soviet Union but with all of the so-called satellites, on “hold.” Again, some
                    differentiation was at play, because we studied, we scrutinized what the various
                    Eastern European governments said about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
                    during the two or three weeks after it took place. Of course, the East Germans
                    instinctively praised the Soviets. They had learned how to do this all along.
                    That is an interesting subject unto itself. The East Germans, as I learned while
                    I was there, were the pariahs of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets hated them, and
                    the other Eastern Europeans were scared to death of them and despised them. So
                    they had very little “wiggle space.” One of the ways by which they tried to
                    ingratiate themselves with the Soviets, to gain “wiggle space,” was to praise
                    whatever the Soviets did in the international field. So East Germany came right
                    out in full support of the invasion of Afghanistan, and “boom”—that was the end
                    of any possible effort to improve trade relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis at the time? You were looking at the
                        East Germans within the Eastern Bloc. Why were they so..</hi>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SMITH: They were Germans. World War II was a bitter memory for the leadership of
                    all of the Eastern European countries. These guys [the East Germans] may have
                    been “their” Germans, but they were still Germans. The hatred between the Slavs
                    and the Germans is enough to make one's head spin. We in the West do not know
                    what hatred means, in a European context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were they also considered, by any chance, to be the
                        Soviets' “enforcers?” I'm thinking of, what was it, 1968 or 1969, the [time
                        of the invasion of] Czechoslovakia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968. The Hungarians did, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were the [East] Germans seen as a kind of “stalking
                        horse” or “bully boy” that the Soviets could use? Was there something in
                        this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I do not think so. I think that the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians knew
                    that the Russians did not like the Germans any more than they did. Indeed, the
                    Soviets would have been very hesitant to use East Germany as an instrument of
                    Soviet policy, within the context of the Warsaw Pact. Because the Soviets
                    themselves knew how strong the hatred of the Germans was. The fact that the East
                    Germans had the extent of maneuverability and, in fact, influence within the
                    Warsaw Pact that they did is a tribute to their own political finesse. It was a
                    rough life to be East Germany within the Soviet-dominated community.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, I do not think that the man has died yet. When I got there, he and
                    my predecessor were not on speaking terms. My predecessor, Sol Polansky, was a
                    well-known and beloved Foreign Service officer, a long-time East European
                    specialist. Bohlen did not know about Eastern Europe or the communist world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: David Bohlen, a commercial officer, entered the Foreign Service in about
                    1948, at which time there were, perhaps, two or three African-American Foreign
                    Service officers. He was told, when he entered the Service—he loved to tell the
                    story, and I have no reason to doubt it—that at that time, 1948, there was only
                    one posting he could have, Liberia. He endured a lot of difficulty—let us put it
                    that way—as an African-American Foreign Service officer. He came out of it doing
                    very well. But this bitter and difficult experience had its impact on him. By
                    the time I got to East Berlin in 1979, I am sorry to say, David Bohlen had
                    become paranoid. Or so it seemed. There was only one other black on the American
                    staff, a communicator. I had the impression that Bohlen quite literally
                    concluded that every single member of the Embassy staff, except this young black
                    woman on the communications staff, was his enemy and was out to make him look
                    bad, to trip him up, and to disobey him.</p>
                <p>He gave me the benefit of the doubt. I had simply made known my interest in posts
                    that were open. Sol Polansky, my predecessor, was devoid of racial
                    prejudice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Low key.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: A savvy, warm person. I do not mind telling you that the fact that
                    Ambassador Bohlen apparently decided that Polansky was not on his side is a sign
                    of how mixed up Bohlen's thinking and feelings seem to have been when I got
                    there. He decided that I was going to be his salvation. I had been away from
                    East European affairs for a number of years. I was not a “creature” of the
                    Office of German Affairs—and here Bohlen's complaint had some justification.
                    Bohlen felt that the Department had allowed the “pro-Bonn forces” in the Foreign
                    Service, in effect, to sit on our relationship with East Germany, instead of
                    allowing it to go its natural way, i.e., toward the expansion of commercial
                    relations. Bohlen's background was strictly economic and commercial affairs. I
                    began to see things Bohlen's way, that, in effect, the West German desk in
                    Washington was telling the Embassy in East Berlin exactly how to run its
                    affairs. Furthermore, our West German desk in Washington was letting the West
                    Germans tell them what to tell us. It was ridiculous.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Ambassador Bohlen decided, because I was not out of the West German Affairs mold
                    and had been away from East European and communist affairs for nine years while
                    I worked on the Middle East, that I was going to be a “safe” bet for him, and it
                    was like a drowning man looking for a life raft. He decided that he liked me. He
                    came to call on me in the fall of 1978 at my home here in Washington—he and his
                    wife. My wife and I put on the best show we could for them. We did not have any
                    help. We lived in a tiny house in the South East section of Washington, D. C.,
                    but we made a good impression on the Bohlens. I had plenty of competition [for
                    the job], but he chose me to be his new DCM. After I got to East Berlin, I
                    worked hard for him. I am reasonably satisfied that Bohlen did not consider me
                    “the enemy” at any time, from his personal African-American point of view. This
                    was one of the most interesting and sensitive assignments I ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were the DCM. This job involves not just your
                        relationship with the ambassador. You're the general manager of the staff,
                        including all the other officers. How did you handle that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it was not true that the staff was trying to trip him up. The
                    staff just did their job. I was there as an intermediary, which Polansky was not
                    able to be during the last months he was there. In my view, Ambassador Bohlen
                    was foolish in revealing to the rest of the staff how worried he was about them
                    as white men. My arrival more or less neutralized this horrendous, emotional
                    problem which the ambassador seemed to be having. Fortunately, Bohlen trusted me
                    sufficiently that he would seek my views before he would send a policy
                    recommendation to Washington. I was able to help him avoid going too far in one
                    direction or another—not that he did not write well or that he did not make
                    sense, but he was, indeed, new to this area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he act in dealing with East German officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Correctly. His German was hard to understand for them. His German was not
                    “fluent” and had mistakes. Because he spoke English with an African-American
                    accent, he also had trouble speaking German clearly. I have found, in my
                    experience, that the extent to which an individual speaks his or her native
                    language with a regional accent tends to limit his ability, somehow, to learn
                    foreign languages without getting the accent wrong. There are exceptions, but
                    generally speaking, this is true. I found that was part of Ambassador Bohlen's
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The East German authorities were smart enough to know that here was Ambassador
                    Bohlen, who had arrived at the post without the usual preconceptions, let us
                    say, concerning U.S.-Soviet relations and, above all, U.S.-West German
                    relations, and was willing to try, within reason, to improve U.S.-East German
                    economic relations. This is exactly what the East Germans needed, and so they
                    appreciated what Bohlen was trying to do. He had as cordial relations with the
                    East German authorities as any American ambassador could have. This is not
                    saying a great deal, considering the Cold War divide. Ambassador Bohlen left
                    East Berlin ten months after I got there, and I was charg� d'affaires for about
                    four months between his departure and the arrival of Ambassador Herb Okun.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Herb Okun as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Herb Okun is a maestro with relatively few personal hang-ups. He is quite
                    open about them. Okun, of course, has an ego that would barely fit in this room,
                    but he is an extraordinarily sensitive, smart man. And he has a sense of humor.
                    Sometimes he could have afforded to have more of a sense of humor, but after
                    Ambassador Bohlen, Ambassador Okun was a joy, because he was a real “pro.” He
                    was, first and foremost, a political officer, and that is what you needed in
                    East Berlin. Secondly, he was a Soviet expert, which is what you needed in East
                    Berlin. And thirdly, he was not going to sit back and take instructions from
                    Washington if he could help it—instructions which, in effect, had been written
                    in Bonn—any more than Bohlen was. Okun was infinitely more sophisticated in how
                    to deal with this problem.</p>
                <p>Herb Okun is an extraordinary individual, as you know. He did a very good job in
                    East Berlin.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me how you saw this? You arrived new on the
                        scene, and all of a sudden, wham!—there you were. How would you describe the
                        political atmosphere of the American Embassy in East Germany and the
                        American Embassy in Bonn and the relations between these two. I think that
                        they were not quite friendly powers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SMITH: They really were not. As I said before, there was not much room for
                    maneuver for those serving in East Berlin. They were certainly not friendly to
                    the East German regime but did not see why U.S. policy toward East Germany
                    should be written by the West Germans. Particularly when the West Germans would
                    ask us not to do something, politically or economically, and then would turn
                    around and do it themselves. That was the ultimate, aggravating part of it. All
                    of this became almost hypothetical once the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. The
                    East German regime, as I said before, came out with blatant praise for the
                    Soviet action, and that meant the end of any possible improvement in U.S.-East
                    German relations right there. That happened in January 1980.</p>
                <p>The Polish Solidarity Crisis: Moscow's Nonintervention</p>
                <p>The next thing that happened, which made serving in East Berlin extremely
                    interesting all over again, but for a totally different reason, was the boiling
                    up of the Solidarity crisis in the summer of 1980 in Poland. I do not think I am
                    betraying U.S. security interests in saying this, but we received one alert
                    after another between August and December 1980, instructing us to keep a
                    substantive officer up all night because, within 24 hours, there was a good
                    possibility that the Soviets were going to intervene militarily in Poland. We
                    had every officer in the Embassy—at least every junior officer—constantly
                    driving around [East Germany]. We did not have any military attach�s in East
                    Berlin. So consular and administrative officers—everybody—was busy driving along
                    the East German-Polish border, looking for military concentrations. It was a
                    very heady exciting time.</p>
                <p>The reason that this made serving in East Germany interesting was that—and I
                    think with fairly good reason—the U.S. intelligence community began to look upon
                    East German statements and activities in relation to this bubbling crisis in
                    Poland as something of a litmus test as to what the Soviets might do. Now I have
                    no doubt whatever in my mind that [Erich] Honecker [East German president] was
                    urging the Soviets to intervene in Poland. Honecker was not wrong. The
                    Solidarity crisis [ostensibly] calmed down when [General] Jaruzelski became, in
                    effect, the military dictator of Poland. However, in fact it never really did
                    calm down. It was the beginning of the end of the whole Soviet system. So
                    Honecker was “right” in his advice to Moscow. But the Soviets, for other
                    reasons, decided to hold their fire. Remember, in 1956 they had intervened in
                    Hungary and in 1968, in Czechoslovakia. They had less reason for doing this than
                    the situation in Poland was giving them in 1980-81. The difference was that the
                    Soviets began to see the handwriting on the wall and figured that the day was
                    over when they could intervene and get away with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They [the Soviets] also didn't have really strong
                        leadership at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. Brezhnev was dying in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there were two other Soviet leaders, Andropov and
                        Chernenko, who died within a year of each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. That was a bit later, but, furthermore, the Soviet armed
                    forces were tied down in Afghanistan and were way over committed there. There
                    were various reasons why the Soviets figured that they were not going to mess
                    things up. It appears that the main reason was that the Poles had rather large
                    armed forces, unlike the armed forces of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. That is the
                    first point. The second point is that the Russians knew, historically, that the
                    Poles are utter daredevils who would not hesitate to resist with force any
                    Soviet incursion into Poland. That is why they [the Soviets] did not intervene
                    in Poland in 1956, when they thought about it, because the Poles had perhaps
                    400,000 men on the ground and would not hesitate—in fact would consider it
                    “glorious”—to give up their lives shooting Russians, which the Czechs and
                    Hungarians were smart enough not to do. So the unpredictability of the Poles,
                    the depth of their hatred for the Russians, and their adventurous—almost
                    comically bravado-type attitude toward war—and the large size of their armed
                    forces—were all considerations.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sitting right on their [the Soviets] lines of
                        communications. Well, how did you find dealing with the East Germans? Were
                        you ever able to sit down and talk with some of the officials at your
                        level—were they real “apparatchiks” or creatures of the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The officials were creatures of the government. But I arrived in East
                    Berlin believing that the GDR [German Democratic Republic] was a monolith. I am
                    embarrassed to tell you this, although I had plenty of company among people who
                    had been tracking the situation in that part of the world up to that point. I
                    believed that the regime, which was indeed one of the most sophisticated police
                    states of all time, had all forms of dissent under control, and there was no way
                    that I was going to have a meaningful relationship with East Germans. This was
                    not true at all. East Germany was seething with discontent and dissent, and
                    Honecker, who was a very competent politician, knew better than to try to stifle
                    it. The reason why all of us, looking at the GDR from afar, thought that the
                    East Germans had achieved police state homogeneity par excellence was that they
                    were Germans, that Germans believe in order, and that Germans strive for proper
                    appearances. And this enormous amount of dissent and discontent never was
                    reported in the press—at least very rarely.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>To prevent the situation from blowing up in his face, Honecker allowed—and made a
                    conscious decision to allow—a fair amount of dissent to go on. He allowed
                    Western diplomats to meet with physicians, artists, and movie producers. We knew
                    all kinds of East Germans who criticized the regime at length, away from the
                    microphones in my residence. They had analyzed why the regime was doing this or
                    that and whether it was dumb or stupid or smart. They were totally open in their
                    pro-Western feelings. It was a heady, exciting time, compared to my tour of duty
                    in Poland, let alone my tour of duty in the Soviet Union. Also, the fact that I
                    was a senior officer must have helped. I was able to have remarkably open
                    relationships with members of a wide spectrum of East German society. If I ever
                    entertained anybody from the Foreign Ministry, the guy would toe the
                    [government] line right down to the last word and was an “apparatchik.” No
                    question about it. I knew many people from many walks of life. The private
                    sector [in East Germany]—again, something that Honecker had encouraged—had grown
                    by the time I got there. Something like one out of five or six shops was
                    privately owned. Taxes for private entrepreneurs had been reduced. Some of the
                    best doctors in East Germany were in private practice. So the East German
                    situation presented a mixed picture.</p>
                <p>I repeat that the reason why I was convinced that it was not going to be like
                    that was because of certain characteristics of the German personality, as seen
                    from afar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been very aware of the fact that the East
                        Germans provided a kind of training ground for repressive police regimes all
                        over the world—still in power in Libya and some other places. Did you feel
                        that you were being set up or that—what are they called, “honey traps?”
                        [i.e., sexual entrapments]—were being used, and not just against you? Were
                        there other provocations, or were we beyond that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, there were the usual provocations. The provocations which were the
                    most worrisome were highly sophisticated efforts on the part of “Stasi” [Secret
                    Police] operatives to engage one or another Embassy officer by sending a very
                    convincing defector into the Embassy. This happened about every three months.
                    One happened just after Ambassador Okun arrived, and it was a tough one for him
                    to decide. Okun made the decision to violate a long-standing, fundamental rule
                    for American embassies behind the Iron Curtain. He allowed an East German couple
                    to stay for several days in the embassy, because he concluded—I think
                    correctly—that these people were genuine defectors. But we had had some very
                    persuasive “fakes” sent to us—to our homes as well as to the chancery. East
                    Germans, by and large, could get into and out [of our embassy]. They certainly
                    did not have to show ID's, as they did going in and out of the embassy in
                    Moscow. They were usually followed around the corner, if they were on foot, by a
                    member of the East German secret police and then required to show
                    identification, [after they had visited the embassy].</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Although East Germans could get into our embassy, God knows what happened to them
                    when they left. As long as they did not say the wrong things within earshot of a
                    microphone, and if they had a car waiting for them at the front gate, they could
                    get in and out [of the Embassy] without being “caught,” so to speak. So that is
                    how it happened that we did have both “real” and “phony” defectors on our hands.
                    Sex was used—all of the usual little tricks. The East Germans, as you said
                    before, were very talented in this kind of activity. Again, the East Germans,
                    being Germans, were much more hesitant to pull these games on senior Embassy
                    officers than they were with junior Embassy officers. There was the good old
                    German sense of authority: that you do not mess around with the senior
                    people.</p>

                    only the Western press but the United States and other Western governments
                    assessed the East German economy as the only success story behind the Iron
                    Curtain—the fifth largest industrial nation in the world. Nonsense! The East
                    German economy was going to hell in a hand basket at that time. My wife knew
                    this because, being a smart, instinctively commercial person, she would go out
                    and check factories and markets and travel all around the country—as we could do
                    freely, incidentally. She knew, intuitively, that the East German economy was on
                    its last legs.</p>

                <p>SMITH: We thought that the East Germans—despite the Soviet system—were making
                    their economy work. They were growing and they had considerable research and
                    development capability—first class scientists. The Soviets paid the East Germans
                    real money to do a lot of the experimentation and development for them. So that
                    part is true—they did have a lot of talent. But the notion that, despite having
                    to go through certain motions, because of their Marxist system, they were able
                    to rationalize their economy simply was not true. Frankly, I had virtually no
                    background in economic affairs at that time and I could not judge this. I
                    accepted the conventional wisdom within the U.S. Government that the East
                    Germans were growing and were way ahead of the other East European countries.
                    They just were not. They were just barely keeping it all together. They were
                    Germans. That was why we were all fooled. They were sophisticated. They knew how
                    to falsify their statistics in a way where Western intelligence analysts would
                    miss it, unlike the Czechs and the Poles, who just could not carry this off.
                    They were methodical in their deception with respect to the horrendous condition
                    of their economy, as only the Germans can be. I think that that is part of the
                    reason why we were all fooled.</p>

                <p>SMITH: [It was also] a scholarship failure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All across the board was the lack of appreciation of how

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think that we had a better sense, with respect to the other East
                    European countries, than we did in the case of East Germany. East Germany was
                    the most glaring, single example of this, and I would say that the Soviet Union
                    was the next most glaring example. Our assessment of where things stood
                    economically in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Balkans was probably
                    much closer to the mark.</p>

                        last thing. Was there any change when the Carter administration came into
                        office? The next administration was under Reagan. You were in East Germany
                        during part of that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Reagan came into office...</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SMITH: That is right. Ambassador Ridgway did not come until the beginning of
                    1983.</p>
                <p>Our relations with East Germany, and most countries in Eastern Europe in general,
                    were absolutely frozen, as I said before, from the time of the Soviet invasion
                    of Afghanistan onwards. The U.S.-Soviet relationship became very rocky because
                    of that Soviet action. Then the tensions rising from the Solidarity crisis in
                    Poland made things very difficult and brittle, too.</p>
                <p>Your question is a good one, in that President Reagan came into office with
                    antiquated Cold War rhetoric. You would have expected him to dump ice water onto
                    the even token relationships we had with a place like East Germany. But because
                    of Afghanistan and Solidarity, we had already done whatever we could to “ruin”
                    our relations with East Germany before President Reagan came into office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 12, 1993. We will continue our interview
                        with Walter B. Smith. The last question which we didn't cover was how did
                        Ambassador Roz Ridgway operate? You mention what a “frozen” period this was
                        in East Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was there with her for less than six months. She had dealt with German
                    affairs at some point, but it was a number of years before, at that juncture.
                    She went from the GDR to EUR [as Assistant Secretary of State for European
                    Affairs]. She had not come from EUR, if I remember correctly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She may have been in Finland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think so. She was getting into touch with the issues. She took no
                    particular initiatives during the time I was there under her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, you've said that it was a “frozen” period,
                        and it takes an ambassador a while to get into the swing of things.
                        Obviously, the East Germans weren't jumping all over to get her to do
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SMITH: There was not much that they could do. They understood our legislative and
                    political system well enough to realize that the “freeze,” for example, on any
                    possible increase in U.S. trade with the GDR was really quite serious. I think
                    that one of the reasons why Ambassador Ridgway, during those five months or so,
                    did not start thinking out loud about possible initiatives may have been the
                    fact that her predecessor, Ambassador Herbert Okun, had an enormously sensitive
                    “feel” for the Washington situation, the U.S.-Soviet relationship, and the role
                    of the GDR in our perception of things. He also understood West German relations
                    very well. He was a hard act to follow. There was not anything important left
                    undone when she came on the scene, and she became quickly [aware of this], as I
                    remember it. I was charg� d'affaires a total of nine months during my tour in
                    the GDR, but there was not any real gap between Ambassadors Okun and
                    Ridgway—maybe a few weeks. There was a fairly long gap between Ambassadors
                    Bohlen and Okun—about two and a half months.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then when did you leave East Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I left at the end of June, 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you returned to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Without a clear assignment, which was perplexing to me, to say the least.
                    I probably was unwise to have stayed four years in East Berlin. Almost a year
                    before my time was up, I began getting in touch with people like Harry Thayer,
                    who was Ambassador to Singapore. There was a political appointee in Copenhagen
                    who was looking around for a DCM, whom I went to see. I stopped in London to see
                    Ed Streator, on my way from East Berlin back to Washington. I do not recall what
                    assignment I was fishing for in London. It is indeed disconcerting—this is still
                    generally relevant because it is probably still true—to a Foreign Service
                    officer whose every single assignment dropped nicely into place all through his
                    junior and mid-career years, to find himself as a senior officer having really
                    to “scrounge” for a new assignment. I had never had this experience before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience. It's horrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It is horrible. There may be a more competitive situation for junior and
                    mid-career officers now to try to guide and pin down their upcoming assignments,
                    so that it is not a novelty toward the end of their careers. I hope so, because
                    I am not a good bureaucratic fighter at all. In fact, I have quite a bit of
                    dislike for that sort of thing. I suppose that if I had worked at it more
                    methodically, I could have landed something. I do not know.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But actually you got into some rather interesting
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: By accident I found myself working for the Pentagon—not physically, but at
                    Ft. McNair, housed in the National War College, with a very bright bunch of
                    people. John Despres was the Director of this “think tank” called the Strategic
                    Concepts Development Center. John Despres is about to become Assistant Secretary
                    of Commerce for Export Enforcement. When he left the Defense Department, he
                    worked for the Select Intelligence Committee of the Senate and for [Senator]
                    Bill Bradley. He did that for a number of years.</p>
                <p>In this little “think tank” there were career Defense types, three from the armed
                    services and some civilian analysts who had been knocking around Defense for a
                    long time, and they could trace for me the history of these initiatives.
                    Apparently, since World War II there have been efforts made in the Defense
                    Department to create, under the Secretary of Defense, a little group of thinkers
                    with no involvement in the bureaucracy. They would be “freewheeling.” It is very
                    disturbing to the traditional military officer to have such people around
                    because, obviously, in the light of their affiliation with the Secretary [of
                    Defense], the career military people, who like to do things in a very organized
                    way, have to pay attention to these people. From a military point of view, such
                    people are “unguided missiles.” However, something very refreshing can, and
                    often does, come of these things. This little group was probably on its last
                    legs. When I got there, it had been in existence for six or seven years. We did,
                    indeed, meet with [Secretary of Defense] Caspar Weinberger once a month and
                    throw “heretical” ideas at him. Weinberger enjoyed it and, I think, may have
                    profited from it.</p>
                <p>The one study that I did early on and from which I drew quite a bit of
                    satisfaction concerned the initiatives the United States could take during a
                    period of mounting tension in Europe to try to separate the East Europeans from
                    the Soviets. This involved a number of ideas about “disinformation” and lures to
                    the communist governments of Eastern Europe that we could undertake, without
                    necessarily increasing the danger of war with the Soviet Union. That was the big
                    “if,” of course, because this was potentially a dangerous idea. If the Soviets
                    were having some kind of internal crisis and the Soviet leadership was extremely
                    nervous and was, in fact, creating some kind of East-West crisis because of
                    domestic problems, and we seemed to be making life more difficult for the Soviet
                    Union vis-a-vis their allies in Eastern Europe, this could have tipped the
                    scales in the direction of real war. But I think that the array of ideas that I
                    came up with was within reason. Anyway, that really excited a lot of imagination
                    in the Defense Department. This is the kind of thing that we were doing.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I think that that is overstated. They inevitably had conflicts of

                        defense have been. It didn't sit too well, you may say, with the State
                        Department. Did you have this feeling that Weinberger was—because you're

                <p>Removing the U.S. Marines from Beirut</p>
                <p>SMITH: “Fun” is not the word I would use. Weinberger, in my limited exposure to
                    him, seemed like a conscientious person who worried a great deal. He may,
                    indeed, have worried about the possibility that this or that U.S. foreign policy
                    initiative was going to go awry and he may have fought against the position of
                    the State Department, both overtly and behind the scenes. But it would not have
                    just been for amusement on his part but out of a genuine concern, justified or
                    not. I was involved with the decision that got the Marines out of Beirut, which
                    is where they should never have been in the first place, because they did not
                    have a defined role. They were there for reasons of “symbolism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they [the Marines] stay there? What was your
                        impression of why they were staying there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SMITH: They were supposed to be implicitly a trip-wire, but we were not about to
                    back up this trip-wire. There were so many combatants floating around Beirut who
                    could easily trip over the “wire” that we were leading with our chin. The
                    problem is that the United States did not take a clear-cut position—this is just
                    me talking—in opposition to the Israeli operation in Lebanon which, at the
                    beginning and with very limited objectives, was at least understandable, if not
                    smart. We could be relatively neutral [about it], with justification. But then
                    the Israelis misread our tea leaves and decided that, as far as we were
                    concerned, they had carte blanche, and they went into Beirut. It was at that
                    point that we should really have come out with strong disapproval and
                    opposition. But we did not. We minced our words. What really shook things up, if
                    you recall, was that horrible massacre at the Shatila...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Sabra [refugee camps south of Beirut].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That happened in September 1982. That [massacre] personally upset
                    President Reagan. Within a week or so, for the first time during the Reagan
                    administration, the U.S. came out with a Middle East peace initiative, an
                    all-encompassing peace initiative, which did not get anywhere. This upset the
                    Israelis and was what we should have been doing all along. Enough said.</p>
                <p>So sending the Marines into Beirut was a gesture, as I saw it, to help compensate
                    for the fact that we had gone along with the Israeli invasion of central
                    Lebanon, beyond the initial invasion farther to the south. The [Marine presence
                    in Beirut] was pointless. The issue became how we could withdraw the Marines
                    without loss of face and without demoralizing Lebanese moderates. That is where
                    I came into the picture. I proposed that, for every Marine taken out, we should
                    explain that we were sending U.S. military “training personnel” into Lebanon to
                    assist the government of Lebanon in developing the military wherewithal to
                    police its own house. I have forgotten what the other gimmickry was, but it was
                    used by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the same day I proposed it,
                    on a Saturday. He went to the White House, and he carried the day. Weinberger
                    was not even present. The chairman obtained White House approval for announcing
                    that the Marines were going to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that period [assigned to the “think” tank]—you were
                        there how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Historical Continuity and the Foreign Service</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SMITH: Two years, from 1983 to 1985. It was a two-year assignment. Then—I do not
                    recall how it was that Steve Low [Ambassador Stephen Low, then Director of the
                    Foreign Service Institute] and I got in touch— by accident he and I had been
                    thinking along parallel lines. He was planning an effort to bring about what has
                    finally happened: that is, a proper “campus” for FSI. He felt, as I did, that
                    the Foreign Service did not have a sufficient sense of identity, particularly
                    among incoming new officers. He wanted to have a “museum” in the new FSI
                    building. The military do this [sort of thing] extremely well, as you probably
                    know. [The museum was intended] to reflect Foreign Service traditions and the
                    history of the Foreign Service, particularly for new Foreign Service people to
                    understand that they are part of an organization which has existed practically
                    from the time of the [American] Revolution and that has been very much
                    intertwined with key moments in American history.</p>
                <p>So he and I teamed up to get the Association for Diplomatic Studies going, which
                    was going to work on history, including oral history, and on the notion of a
                    “display”—a better way to put it would be a museum of artifacts—to illustrate
                    the evolution of the history of the Foreign Service. I enjoyed that very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, for the record here, I am part of this
                        organization [Association for Diplomatic Studies]. Actually, I had been
                        trying to do some oral history also at George Washington University. I
                        joined up with your organization, so this is of great interest to me. What
                        was the reaction [to this idea]? You and Steve Low had a meeting of the
                        minds and you moved over to the Foreign Service Institute. What were some of
                        the attitudes which you encountered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were largely negative, except in the Office of the Historian [of the
                    Department of State]. I was absolutely amazed that there were such good records
                    gathering dust there covering the early history of our Foreign Service posts. I
                    did something of a survey—and I also published a book. I think you have it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have a copy of your book. It is a very useful book
                        about diplomatic and consular officers up to the Civil War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: [The Civil War] was not an inherent cutoff date. I chose just to make the
                    subject matter manageable. I would love to have done another book covering the
                    later periods, but the records covering the beginning period of the diplomatic
                    and consular service were so modest to the end of the Civil War that it was
                    something that I could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, it's a standard resource book which is used all
                        the time. Was the idea of enhancing the morale of the Foreign Service a
                        project that seemed to interest people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think that people were highly skeptical that a sense of historical
                    perspective was going to make much difference. I hope that they were wrong. I
                    have not followed this [matter more recently] and I do not know what has come of
                    the idea of the historical display. Artifacts have been donated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A few. It's still in embryonic form, but I think that with
                        the advent of the new campus, which will start operations in September,
                        1993—I don't know when [my operation] will move.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Is there enough space?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are areas. It's not going to be a space, but there
                        will be areas, where there will be displays, to begin with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It is a pity not to have it all in one place for maximum impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just a beginning. We're talking about decades. I
                        think it's starting. You look at almost any senior managers in the Foreign
                        Service. They go to a great deal of trouble to employ a highly selected
                        elite. After all, you have a very competitive [Foreign Service] exam. The
                        average Foreign Service officer is six or seven cuts above most other
                        agencies, business firms, or anything else, because of the selection
                        process. Then the senior managers seem to do everything to drag people down,
                        not telling them that they are good but saying that this is what you do—and
                        that you're going to go to dangerous or lousy places. It strikes me as
                        wasting a product.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: All I can do is say, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what got this Association [for Diplomatic Studies]
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It had to be incorporated. We did not have any money. In any case we did
                    not want to get lawyers into the act. I prepared the incorporation papers
                    myself. It is incorporated in District of Columbia as a non-profit organization.
                    That took a long time—at least for me, because it was all new to me.
                    [Ambassador] Dick Parker entered the scene at that time. By the time I left,
                    which was May 1986, after 11 months, there were roughly 300 members. There were
                    contributions and pledges of more than $250,000 in just 11 months and so it
                    looked as though it was off to a good start.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your last assignment [in the Department of State] was
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Deputy Director of the Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs under a
                    wonderful individual named Hans Binnendijk. He has been in the field of foreign
                    affairs all along, in one way or another, but he is mainly concerned with
                    defense matters and has spent almost his whole career on the Hill [Congress]. A
                    relatively young person. He was the second Director of this center but the first
                    really substantive Director.</p>
                <p>Again, this kind of “think tank” in the State Department which would have some
                    freedom from policy concerns to come up with “heretical” ideas was not all that
                    dissimilar from my Defense Department experience. It did have some bureaucratic
                    responsibilities. It was saddled with the supervision, to the extent that they
                    could be supervised, of FSOs serving as “Diplomats in Residence.” This was
                    difficult. It was not supposed to be part of my responsibilities but it ended up
                    taking up a good slice of my time. I was engaged in trying to track these people
                    down, trying to keep a record of what they were doing, and trying to integrate
                    their activities into a scheme, wherever possible, particularly with research
                    which we ourselves—only about five or six people—were doing in the Center. We
                    also tried to establish better liaison with the academic world in working on
                    current and very recent foreign affairs problems. It seems to me that there is
                    room for the State Department to learn a good deal from the academic world, but
                    there is not a good “inter-face,” if I may use such a wretched term. That was
                    one of the purposes of the Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was there from the summer of 1986 until the summer of 1987 when I
                    entered the crash course to find a job, because I was leaving the Foreign
                    Service. So I was there scarcely a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the reception to this idea of having an
                        organization that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Excuse me for anticipating your question, but a very good point comes to
                    mind. I forgot something important that happened at the Center while I was
                    there. In the face of considerable opposition from the geographic bureaus in the
                    State Department we launched the use of simulations for foreign policy
                    problems—something which the military, again, have put to good use. We called on
                    Chester Crocker and made a pitch to him about southern Africa and about the
                    usefulness of having a simulation on it. He overrode everybody in the Bureau of
                    African Affairs, whose opposition was vociferous. We did, indeed, have a
                    simulation of a mounting crisis. It took all of one Saturday.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chester Crocker was the Assistant Secretary of State for
                        African Affairs...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He was the Assistant Secretary at the time—a bit of a maverick who had a
                    very fine brain.</p>
                <p>We had two or three of these [simulations] before I left the State Department. I
                    was thrown into the breach to get this going, although we had a contract for
                    advice with Lincoln Bloomfield from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology],
                    a brilliant man. He had been used by the Defense Department in extensio to get
                    various simulations or “games” going for military purposes, with situations
                    which had strong foreign policy overtones. We hired him as a consultant to get
                    this [process] launched at State. Then, eventually, we picked up a very bright
                    young fellow—also from some Congressional staff—who had a background in this
                    area and ran with the ball. But I had to get the thing started. I did not know a
                    thing about it, either, but I was a “convert,” especially after associating with
                    Linc Bloomfield.</p>
                <p>As I said, there were two or three of these [simulations] conducted. One of the
                    most interesting ones while I was there dealt with the Korean peninsula. We
                    created a “war is imminent” scenario. The scenarios were very carefully written
                    to be convincing and realistic and to include enough factors of instability to
                    force the participants to get very excited and busy. The scenarios were written
                    in the Department [of State] by ourselves or by the [geographic] desk but
                    usually by a team of both, with minimal academic or outside guidance, except for
                    “theatrical purposes,” if you will. We would get Bloomfield to give a good
                    “scrub” to these scenarios so that they would work, because he had had the
                    experience of running simulations before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the third [simulation]...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There were [simulations] on southern Africa, the Korean peninsula, and one
                    related to India and Pakistan. In each case the [regional] bureau in question
                    resisted the idea, but we were able to persuade the assistant secretary
                    personally to sponsor it, and so people had to fall in line. What I really want
                    to tell you is that every single participant—they were all FSOs—said afterwards
                    that the experience was enormously valuable. I have not followed up on this to
                    see whether this is still happening or not.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I know that it continued for at least a half year or a year after I had
                    left the scene but I do not know anything more than that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you retired at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I went back to Columbia University and finished the graduate work
                    which I had interrupted when I entered the Foreign Service, which was very
                    satisfying. I really only had to finish writing a major paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on your Foreign Service career, what gives
                        you your greatest [sense of] satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think that the sense of adventure and the sense of comradeship with
                    people in [the Service] for the same reasons: namely, serious concern about the
                    importance of defending and advancing the position of the United States in the
                    world. I am hard put to answer [your question]. Whether it was the adventure or
                    the comradeship—I think that it was the two in combination. As I drove here
                    today, I passed the house I first lived in from 1958 to 1960 in Georgetown, when
                    living in Georgetown was inexpensive, because a number of other brand new FSOs
                    were also living there. I thought about my first wife's and my excitement in the
                    summer of 1959 when we had been here only one year, and I was sent on temporary
                    duty to Moscow to work at the American National Exhibition. I had spent years
                    learning the Russian language and then studying Russian history as a graduate
                    student. I had never been there. My wife managed to have herself sent to Moscow
                    by an American company as an exhibitor and learned quite a bit of Russian for
                    the purpose, although that was not a requirement. That was one of the most
                    exhilarating experiences of my life, although I knew quite a bit about the
                    country of this temporary assignment. One of my principal, driving interests was
                    Russian history and culture, and that would have made it exciting under any
                    circumstances. So I do not have a good, concise answer to your question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've given a concise answer in a way. You're talking
                        about the exhilaration and the comradeship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. “Elitism” is the wrong term. There certainly was a sense that we were
                    all dedicated, that we all had been carefully chosen, and that we were on the
                    move—not individually, but as a group. That is, the young Foreign Service was
                    really going to “make a difference” in the future of the United States.</p>
