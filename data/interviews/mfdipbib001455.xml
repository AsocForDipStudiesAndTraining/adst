                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I was born in Portland, Oregon on July 24, 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me something about your father's side and your
                        mother's side to let me know something about your family</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: My father was a Baptist minister in Oregon City, Oregon about 13 miles
                    south of Portland at the time of my birth. He had been raised as a farmer's only
                    son in the Yakima valley of Washington, and went to Linfield College as an
                    undergraduate in McMinnville, Oregon. He met my mother, Irene Swanson, at
                    Linfield College who was one of eight children of Swedish speaking Finns who had
                    immigrated to the United States. She was the only one to go to college in her
                    family, worked her way through and was a year ahead of my father. Her father
                    actually was an illegal immigrant. He was escaping impressment in the Czar's
                    army at the turn of the century and somehow got on the boat, and somehow got off
                    the boat and ended up in a small mining town in western Montana where he met my
                    grandmother. When I was assigned to Moscow in the early '90's, we went over to
                    Finland and visited some relatives there, and while there found out that my
                    grandfather and grandmother on my mother's side actually lived in neighboring
                    villages, didn't know each other, and traversed the Atlantic Ocean and pretty
                    much all the continent of the United States and ended up in a small mining town
                    in Montana where they married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Slaghts? Where did they...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: The Slaghts have a quite a deep history. My father wrote two books on our
                    ancestry. He was a genealogy buff. The first Slaght came from Holland in 1644 to
                    help found the city of Kingston, New York. There is a little plaque on the
                    inside foyer of the Dutch Reformed Church in Kingston with my ancestor's name,
                    one of about 14 that helped found that church in that city. We also had our
                    share of “horse thieves,” if you will. In fact, Benedict Arnold plays some role
                    in our family tree. My father's parents were in the west, and we moved to the
                    east when I was about 8. But we went back nearly every summer. We'd drive, three
                    boys in the back seat of the car with obviously two windows. I don't know how my
                    parents did it when you think about it. There would be occasions when we would
                    stop in these little towns and my father went to the court house and did some
                    genealogical searches. Occasionally he'd have to search a cemetery and he would
                    park fifty cents, two quarters, on the hood of the car, and say I'm looking for
                    this person, and he is buried in this cemetery. Whoever finds the grave marker
                    first gets the money. So we scattered like scared kids hunting around through
                    the cemetery plots. We had a good time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought your family out to Oregon, do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: My grandfather, my father's father, was a farmer in Iowa. He had tried
                    with his father as a young boy to move out of Iowa where the topsoil was about
                    three feet thick to Oklahoma He was actually in the Oklahoma land rush. But it
                    didn't work out. My great grandfather died there, and my grandfather returned
                    back to Iowa where he fell in love with a young woman in Plainfield, Iowa. They
                    eventually married and moved west where they thought more opportunities would be
                    available. They ended up the Yakima valley, near Sunnyside, Washington, where he
                    was a farmer, a successful one, but on a modest scale. He did pretty well in the
                    Depression because when Roosevelt's agriculture guys came out and said they had
                    to slaughter hogs to raise hog prices, while his neighbors did it, he didn't.
                    They made a little money, I guess, as the hog prices increased. He developed a
                    technique in the valley there that was unique at the time, of flooding the area
                    with water. Canals were dug. He flooded the area to leach out the alkalinity of
                    the soil. He was known as a creative, innovative kind of guy. About 1950, he had
                    pretty serious heart attack, and my father at the time was in Oregon City. So
                    they moved my grandparents to Oregon City, Oregon where they remained until
                    their death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in 1943. Brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I have two brothers. An older brother who just retired as Professor of
                    Philosophy at Lafayette College, and a younger brother who is also a PhD — all
                    three of us ended up with PhD's — in animal pathology. He lives in Maine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Oregon for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: My first eight years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family life like back then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The family life revolved around the church. My father was senior pastor
                    for the Baptist Church in Oregon City. I had friends in grade school but I guess
                    closer friends in the church. As kids we'd pick berries in the summer, nuts in
                    the fall, went to the sea shore and went to the mountains. It was a nice time.
                    Good memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a PK, that is, a Preacher's Kid? You'd be more
                        trouble than a normal kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I may have been tagged once or twice with that moniker myself, being more
                    trouble than a normal kid might have been.</p>
                <p>My father was an educated man. He ended up getting a Doctorate of Theology from a
                    seminary in Philadelphia, Eastern Baptist Seminary. I'd say he was an
                    Evangelical Christian, but a moderate one. Social issues, we seldom talked about
                    unless his sons raised them. He was more interested in the soul of a person than
                    his political behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were small, were you a reader or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I wasn't a strong reader, no. I was out playing baseball and tennis and
                    later also other sports. I didn't become a strong student until my senior year
                    of high school when my family moved from Delaware to Massachusetts in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Delaware. Where were you in
                        Delaware?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Dover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the school system there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Fine. I had gone through first and second grades in Oregon City, and I
                    moved east. I didn't find any transition difficulties there. Made friends in the
                    community, in church. Don't remember any unusual difficulties.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Delaware at one point had a significant African-American
                        population. How did that affect your schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Schools were integrated when I was, I guess, a sophomore. Up until then,
                    they went to the Booker T. Washington School across town. They integrated in the
                    late 1950s, but in the first few years we didn't have more than four or five
                    black students that attended. One ended up being president of our senior class,
                    he played in the band, nice guy. Tyrone Baines. Believe it or not, I can
                    remember his name. I can remember I was in band, and we went away to one
                    football game in the southern part of the state. I want to say Seaford, but I'm
                    not positive about this, where the team refused to play us because we had a
                    black guy on the football team. I don't remember any incidents of controversy in
                    our school, though there must have been. I don't remember any. The only incident
                    I recall is that one football game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in the church? Was this an issue or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No, there were no blacks in our church. Even today, you will find I
                    attend I attend a large Baptist church in Falls Church, and there maybe ten
                    blacks in the whole church. It's still one of the most segregated aspects of our
                    society. Sunday morning. I think in some respects, probably in most respects,
                    it's by choice. I attended recently the funeral of a black colleague of my
                    wife's who continues to work at the State Department.It was in a Baptist church
                    in Maryland, and we were the only non-blacks there. We worship the same God, but
                    we do it in different styles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school what subjects did you like, and what
                        subjects didn't you like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I was in college preparatory program. I should say because it has bearing
                    on my eventual career, I took Latin my freshman year, and the teacher was a
                    short, shabbily-dressed woman. Miss App was her name. I took Latin I, but I
                    didn't want to take Latin II, so I took Spanish. While I struggled with Latin, I
                    excelled in Spanish. It had a bearing on what major I eventually adopted in the
                    university, and I think it had some impact on where I ended up as a career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you were in high school, did you have a
                        summer job and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Oh, yes. My first summer job was working on the Dover Air Force Base
                    where I swept the concrete of the new hangers they were building there. I
                    remember it well because the first or second day of the job, the labor foreman
                    came over and said, “Now, young fellow, you know you are not to touch any of the
                    sheet metal here because that's a union job. You sweep around the sheet metal,
                    but don't touch, don't pick up, don't do anything with it.” That was my first
                    experience with a union. I had had paper routes for three or four years before
                    that. In fact, I had paper routes as far back as I can remember, in Dover. I
                    helped my older brother first and then had my own routes. I sold potholders at
                    Christmas time and Christmas cards. I got called into the principal's office
                    when I was in the fifth grade for selling comic books in school. There was
                    always an entrepreneurial spirit in my veins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your senior year you were a math student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. The summer of my junior year, my father took another job in Lowell,
                    Massachusetts almost on the New Hampshire border. So we moved there. I had a
                    girlfriend in Dover and had gone to school there for nine years, had all sorts
                    of friends, had been in Delaware All-State Band. Interesting story, if I might
                    interrupt there. The U.S. Commercial Service would have annual meetings by
                    region: Europe, South America, whatever. One year the European region had a
                    meeting in Pittsburgh, a conference in Pittsburgh. Westinghouse had several
                    boxes at the Pirates' Stadium, Three Rivers Stadium and so several of us went. I
                    was sitting next to colleague, Peter Frederick, who was our man in the Paris at
                    the time, and we got talking and it turns out he played sousaphone in the
                    Delaware All-State Band the same year I played baritone. I actually had a
                    picture of the band and faxed it to him and we had a good laugh about it, being
                    together nearly 30 years before without knowing each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you could see your heel marks coming all the way
                        up there from Dover to Lowell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Could you ever. We got jobs, by brother and I, in a textile mill that's
                    now closed. My older brother was a knitter — ran a knitting machine — and I
                    worked in the winding room. If you know anything about textile mills, the yarn
                    comes in and before it's given top the knitters, they have to be sure it's one
                    continuous strand. They put a little wax on it to make sure it goes through
                    holes just right. The process of rewinding the cotton spins off all sorts of
                    fluff, and I think two years after I left they required masks of everyone
                    working there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hear about the mills way back, terrible for the young
                        ladies...</hi>
                </p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Of course, I didn't have a mask. This was the summer of 1960. I went up
                    and down the aisles with a broom, trying to push this fluff from building up
                    because fans would come around blowing down so that the fluff wouldn't get on
                    the yarn. Unless you went around and swept it up and took it away, the fan would
                    just blow it further. So my job was a very lonely job, and I missed my
                    girlfriend, and most of the workers were French-speaking Canadians. It was a
                    terrible summer for me, I remember that. Then I started the senior year without
                    knowing very many people. I learned to study that senior year. I didn't have my
                    gang, “Come on Dale, let's go out and do...” whatever, so I learned to study. It
                    made a difference in my university experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the mill were you picking up...I realize you were
                        sweeping...was there a feeling that this was an activity that was doomed,
                        sort of the last of the dinosaurs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Other mills had closed in town, many of them. But this one was open and
                    operating fairly efficiently, apparently. They were making cloth for seat covers
                    for the auto industry among other things. They ran three shifts. I worked from 2
                    in the afternoon until 10 at night, so you didn't have the sense that this was a
                    dying sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today the mill buildings are being converted into
                        apartments and museums.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: ...apartments, wonderful hardwood floors, they made apartments out of
                    them. You are absolutely right. You've been there, you know that. That's exactly
                    what had happened. The summer of my senior year, I worked in a shoe factory. My
                    next door neighbor was the owner. Chris Luganis Shoe Factory. I was in the
                    department where you pulled the shoes to fill orders for retail outlets. I did
                    that, actually, the second semester of my senior year and then through the
                    summer. That industry is not entirely dead in New England, but pretty well.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the high school you went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Lowell High. Large place, I forget how many hundreds in my graduating
                    class; several hundred. We had a downtown urban school, old part of town, walked
                    to school. Well, my father took me part way, and then I walked about a half a
                    mile to school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What subjects...all of a sudden you had this
                        awakening...Road to Damascus.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: I excelled in Spanish and did okay in English. I took advanced geometry
                    class my senior year. Social studies in general were stronger for me than any of
                    the sciences or math. It was a much larger school than I had come from, so the
                    opportunities for very interesting courses were afforded me as a difference. So
                    I took an English history course that wouldn't have been available at Dover High
                    School, for instance. I found it fascinating, learning all sorts of things about
                    English history that I didn't know. Useful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Well, my senior yearbook has my career objective as the American Field
                    Service. What they meant to have written was American Foreign Service. American
                    Field Service was a little bit something else involving international exchange
                    with students involved. I was interested in the Foreign Service as a senior in
                    high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get up to Canada or down to Mexico or anything
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: In my college career, I took a junior abroad program. In fact, I
                    initiated the junior program at the small school I was in, and went to Mexico.
                    We didn't go to Canada, though I spent some time on my honeymoon there. It turns
                    out I spent seven years there; two tours there, one in Ottawa and one in Toronto
                    as a Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about college, where were you pointed? Was college in
                        the offing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Never any question in our family that we go to college. It wasn't
                    discussed. It was just a given like you go to church on Sunday, you go to
                    college, and you graduate. Both my parents graduated from seminary, Eastern
                    Baptist Theological Seminary near Philadelphia. This seminary split off an
                    undergraduate division in the early 1950s and that's where my older brother,
                    younger brother and I went. I suppose we could have gone someplace else, but I
                    think it's where my father wanted us to go. I don't remember any particular
                    pressure that he applied, but that's where we all ended up going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: From '61 and I graduated in '66, the winter of '66. I had a half semester
                    longer because during my experience in Mexico I ended up getting hepatitis A
                    from, they think, some raw oysters in a small fishing village just south of what
                    is now Ixtapa. Ixtapa didn't exist in 1963 when I was there. So, I lost the
                    second semester of my year. I went down to attend the University of the Americas
                    in Mexico City at the time. It's an English speaking university at the time on
                    the road to Toluca, which is west southwest of Mexico City. The university is
                    now in Puebla, east of Mexico City. A very nice campus. So, I graduated a
                    semester late from Eastern Baptist College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Baptist was the college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I would guess maybe 40% or 50% were Baptist. They were certainly majority
                    Christian: Methodist, Presbyterian, a few Catholics, whatever. We were required
                    to attend chapel once a week. I was elected in my sophomore year as
                    vice-president of the student body and initiated a once weekly voluntary chapel
                    program where I tried to bring in more interesting speakers than what the
                    university had provided. I invited at one point a professor from Villanova who
                    spoke with us on war and peace issues. This was 1962 or 1963. But it was a
                    Christian college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it a school that was preparing a lot of younger
                        students to be Baptist preachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No. They had a very active sociology professor who has become very
                    famous. Tony Campolo, if you know anything about Christian Evangelical youth
                    speakers. He's one of the top ones in the country. He was sociology professor
                    there and developed a very strong program in the inner city of Philadelphia to
                    help youth and if there's anything the school is known for today it's primarily
                    their outreach in the urban areas of the United States for social work and
                    humanitarian efforts of one kind or another. Pretty good education program, very
                    good science program. A lot of my friends were admitted to medical schools in
                    the Philadelphia area have had long careers as doctors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Romance languages, Spanish and French with almost an equal major in
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the teaching of the languages in those days? Go
                        back to my time in languages when you learn to read and write a language and
                        not much speaking it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's pretty much how it was then, too. We had language labs, but I
                    don't remember spending much time in them. Our teachers were native speakers,
                    that I know for certain. I was a good language student. I got straight A's in
                    French and virtually straight A's in Spanish. But I did sense that if you wanted
                    to learn the language well that you really needed to live in the country, so I
                    asked the school if I could be placed in a university where they transfer the
                    credits. I talked with the American Baptist Convention. My father had some
                    friends there and got some contacts for me, and they gave me a little
                    scholarship money, and that's how I ended up in Mexico City in the fall of
                    1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you were in Massachusetts. Was your family
                        interested much in American politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: My father was always interested in politics. Republican, he was. As a
                    matter of fact, his father wouldn't even buy stamps that had FDR's picture on
                    it, and some of that irrational thought I think seeped into my father. I lived
                    at home when I was later a graduate student at Columbia University, and this was
                    the height of the Vietnam war period, and we had some drag-outs, my dad and I on
                    that issue. He was blind in one eye, and he was rejected for service in the
                    war...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Korea...maybe it was World War II. He was born in 1912, so that was World
                    War II. He always wanted his sons to serve, and three of us did not. I was the
                    only one who got involved in government at all. He was sorry that none of his
                    three sons ever had military service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself engaged in one way or another in the
                        campaign in 1960 between Nixon and Kennedy. They had a lot of young people
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: That was the first campaign that I had any cognizance. I was aware of the
                    Eisenhower-Stevenson campaigns of '52 and then '56, but the Kennedy campaign in
                    '60 was very interesting. I had obtained this tremendous poster in Dover. I
                    don't know where I got it...of Nixon that I had in the attic. In the process of
                    our move to Lowell, that got trashed along with my baseball card collection that
                    was not very well organized. It was up in the attic strewn around, and I don't
                    know how many baseball cards I had of Mickey Mantle and all because I was a
                    Yankee fan. Today, the collection would be worth thousands of dollars, I'm
                    absolutely convinced. But it wasn't organized, and I showed no interest, and my
                    mother just cleaned the attic, and out they went. So I lost this great poster of
                    Nixon. I eventually met him in Moscow long after he resigned. The issue I should
                    say, the issue for us, at least some Protestants, was the influence of the
                    Papacy on the behavior of the president. We certainly talked about that in the
                    family. I remember Kennedy speaking to the Southern Baptist Convention or a
                    convention in Texas and made a very compelling speech on his independence from
                    Papal influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you were in college, did you study Foreign
                        Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I took history courses, lots of them. I was always interested in things
                    international. I suspect papers that I wrote had some relevance to things
                    international. Eastern was too small to have U.S. Diplomatic History courses and
                    that sort of thing. The courses that had some international content were mainly
                    my language classes and a few political science courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your Mexican experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I lived with a Mexican family, headed by a Harvard graduate, an American,
                    who after college wanted some international experience and hired on as a hand on
                    a boat and ended up in Mexico. A Quaker man, a very interesting guy. His wife
                    was Mexican. They had two children: an older son who was not living at home and
                    a daughter that was about my age. I rented a room from them. He was the
                    reference librarian at the university, so I got a ride out with him in the
                    morning and then took buses back in the afternoon. It was a wonderful
                    experience. I learned a lot of things about my own culture, listening to them
                    talk about it from a different perspective than I had ever heard. So I learned a
                    lot about my own country and a lot about Mexico. I was the brunt of some
                    anti-American feelings occasionally, spat on once and pushed around by other
                    young Mexicans. Rode the buses all around Mexico. As a student, I never felt
                    fearful of crime...I didn't have anything to steal, I guess. As an adult during
                    my tour in Mexico City years later, we were constantly concerned about our
                    personal safety, the safety of our automobile, my son's safety there. I don't
                    know whether things had changed that much or whether my perspective was the only
                    thing that had changed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go back?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: I attended a little English speaking church there, and one of the younger
                    adults in the church there decided he'd put together a little group to climb a
                    volcano. So I climbed in November of 1963 the active volcano, Popocatelpetl,
                    which is now active, in Mexico, right up to the rim, 17,000 feet. We had
                    crampons and ice axes that we rented. A wonderful experience. I took my family
                    back to the base of the mountain while we were there and wondered how in the
                    world I could have climbed 17,000 feet. I wasn't quite as heavy and decrepit
                    then, I suppose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you graduated, what were you appointed for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I wanted a Masters Degree in International Affairs and then from there I
                    thought I'd go into professional life, either government or with a bank. So I
                    applied to a few schools which had professional masters programs. Columbia
                    University took me into their School of International Affairs. It's now called
                    the School of Public and International Affairs, I think. Since I graduated in
                    the middle of the year, I spent one semester at Rutgers University in New
                    Jersey. This is where my parents moved from Lowell. He became an editor of a
                    national Baptist journal in New York. So, we moved to New Jersey, and I spent
                    that second semester of 1966 at Rutgers, and then moved to Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Columbia from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: From '66 to '68, the height of the Vietnam War controversy. Marc Rudd and
                    his friends closed down the university for a period of time. I was called a scab
                    as I walked through their lines to the library to study and to check out books.
                    It was a good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often the graduate students at a university are a breed
                        apart from the undergrads. Was this the case at Columbia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That was fair. I would think most of my colleagues did the same, went
                    through the lines to get their books, not all of them. Most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of courses were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: It's a two-year program. You graduate with a Masters in International
                    Affairs, and it's meant as a terminal academic program where you're likely to
                    take a job with Chase Manhattan or the United Nations or with Proctor &amp;
                    Gamble or with a large international operation, rather than going teaching. You
                    could go into government, too. You took a wide range of courses. It's a bit like
                    an undergraduate program where the first two years you take all sorts of liberal
                    arts. You take your fine arts, your psychology, your sociology, your history,
                    language, whatever. And the same with the Masters in Columbia although they are
                    focused on things internationally. You take International Economics, you take
                    Diplomatic History, you take International Organization, you take foreign
                    language, this, that and the other. And then the second year you focus more on
                    concentrated either a functional specialty — economics or history or whatever —
                    or region, Latin America, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I focused on Latin America. That's where I had academic interest and some
                    practical interests out of Mexico, of course. What struck me about Columbia was
                    — and this was made more clear when I went on for a PhD in American University —
                    was the quality of teaching there was no where near what the reputation might
                    have led one to believe. We had renowned professors in their fields who I
                    thought were not very good in the classroom. I audited a class from Brzezinski,
                    for instance, on Soviet Union. Some of my friends also didn't have a background,
                    so you wanted to take a course by one of the leading thinkers and writers in the
                    subject, came to the same conclusion as I that this guy may be a great
                    researcher but he was not a good teacher. He would belittle questioners if the
                    question wasn't up to his degree of precision. I thought that kind of atmosphere
                    in a university was not the kind to promote knowledge. But Columbia had
                    wonderful resources there, and some professors were top notch. I took a course
                    on International Law from Louis Henkin who is a pretty good scholar in U.S.
                    Constitutional Law and in International Law. He was hard as nails. I liked him
                    so much I took his seminar with twelve others the second semester, the second
                    year. Very difficult course, but a brilliant mind and a good person. We got a
                    lot from his class. Leland Goodrich, probably the authority on the United
                    Nations till his death wrote the book on the United Nations — the textbook — was
                    probably too old to be teaching when I was there, although some of his anecdotes
                    were probably worth the price of admission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the time we're talking about, in the mid '60's or so,
                        Black America was no gem in the crown of democracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up? Was this a wasteland for
                        development or what?</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: The issue in this period of time was democracy versus military
                    dictatorship. Arms races were...in fact, I wrote my Masters thesis on an arms
                    race in the southern hemisphere, Argentina and Chile. You know, Peace Corps had
                    just begun to be active in Latin America in the early '60's. AID was beginning
                    activities there. The concern of Castro and whether on the left we'd have
                    dictatorships as we had on the right provided all sorts of interesting
                    discussions and grist for books and articles and concerns on the part of the
                    U.S. government among others. So, it was an interesting cauldron to stir, and
                    with the sense as it came up in the pot, to dissect parts of it and come to some
                    conclusions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of New York and particularly Columbia as being a
                        hotbed of the old German-Jewish socialist group and all that, and in various
                        manifestations to the left. Did you find that there was still much of that
                        around or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No. There may have been, and there certainly was on the campus that sort.
                    I didn't live at home, so it's not like I did a whole lot of socializing after
                    classes with other students. I wasn't involved in any organizations. I was there
                    to be a professional student, study and do well and get a good job when I got
                    out. So no, I didn't come in contact with any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Vietnam War? So much of the students
                        enrolled in the SDS I guess, that's where it started. Students for a
                        Democratic Society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I don't know if it started there, but a fellow named Mark Rudd, who was
                    an undergraduate student there, eventually shut down the university. They
                    invaded the president's office and had a sit-in and closed us down for awhile.
                    There were often demonstrations on the campus there against the war. I don't
                    recall any senior government officials coming to speak, but I'm sure had they
                    come there would have been a demonstration against them. There was certainly
                    talk among the students, among the graduate students as well on the rightness
                    and the wrongness of the war, the morality of the war, the political efficacy of
                    the war, the cost of the war on our own society. All that created fervent
                    discussion and heartfelt arguments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, did this cause you to shy away from
                        government service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No, it didn't. I thought maybe I would still try for foreign service, and
                    I did take the foreign service exam the end of my first year. Maybe it was the
                    beginning semester of my second year there. Passed written and then failed the
                    oral. But I didn't give up. I always had that career in the back of my mind.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions on the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I had indicated to the board I was interested in USIA option. That was a
                    silly thing to do in retrospect. They had these bi-national cultural centers
                    where English was taught, and American values were transmitted. I said gee, this
                    sounds like something I'd like to do, be a director of a bi-national center in
                    Latin America. So I told them that. They said okay, if you had a visitor from
                    Chile coming in this week, where would you take him in New York City? What
                    cultural events would you take in? I was working ten hours a day as a student. I
                    didn't go to plays. I didn't read the cultural section of The Times. I remember
                    that question. That question alone probably did me in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall when I took mine I was an enlisted man in Japan.
                        This was during the occupation, Korean War. I had been in Korea, but I came
                        back to Japan, and they started asking me about the Constitution of Japan. I
                        had just as with many American boys discovered sex in Japan, compared to
                        some Puritan New England. I really wasn't going very heavily into the
                        Constitution aspects of Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I can remember one guy folded airplanes with paper as I answered
                    questions. I gather at the time this was an attempt to rattle you, appeared to
                    be completely disinterested in that was going on in the room. I remember
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had the chance to talk with anybody in the Foreign
                        Service or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No. No one had, to my knowledge, come to recruit on the campus. No. If
                    they had been there, I was unaware of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got this degree, you say this was designed as an
                        end in itself. In other words, this was leading to a job. What were you
                        thinking about doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: This brings us to an entirely different segment of my life; that is, the
                    draft. The end of my first year at Columbia, I got a letter from my draft board
                    saying, in a sense, you're dead meat, buddy. We'll allow you to finish your
                    second year but after that, it's all over. So I finished my second year, but in
                    that period I'd taken the Foreign Service exam and I looked around for another
                    alternative that might give me a deferment. It wasn't clear that it would, but I
                    thought I'd give it a try. So, I applied to the Army Security Agency. The idea
                    there was that I would be sent to Monterrey Language Institute, probably trained
                    in Vietnamese. They never quite indicated what language I would learn, and off
                    I'd be as an interpreter in the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I applied to the Peace Corps, and I applied to the National Security Agency. I
                    had a very good interview at NSA down at Fort Meade, Maryland and things looked
                    pretty good until President Johnson cut the Defense Department by 6 billion
                    dollars, and my job was frozen. So, when the Peace Corps offer came, I took it.
                    I went off to the Upper Peninsula in Michigan at a ski resort in the summer of
                    '68 to learn Portuguese because I was going to be assigned to Brazil as an
                    agricultural agent assistant in Mato Grosso which borders Bolivia. It was in the
                    middle of nowhere in South America. I learned Portuguese. I'd studied it at
                    university. You needed a second language at Columbia. You needed to speak and
                    read one and read another, and I learned Portuguese reading. So I did pretty
                    well at the language school. Then they moved us down to the University of
                    Wisconsin Milwaukee for cultural studies and to go out and visit the 4-H Club
                    and that sort of thing. While there, I got a letter from the General Counsel of
                    the Peace Corps, and they needed to see me right away. My trunk was packed, I'd
                    had my wisdom teeth taken out, I'd had all the shots that I needed, and this was
                    literally one week before I was to go to Brazil for in-country training before
                    being sent to the hinterlands. I was told I may not be able to go, and that I
                    had to go see the General Counsel.</p>
                <p>So I came to Washington in early September of '68 and had a long discussion with
                    the General Counsel himself. Background investigators from NSA and Peace Corps
                    were doing investigations on me. Separate ones. The Peace Corps folks had talked
                    to my girlfriend at the time about my loyalty to as an American citizen. She
                    offered the fact that he's obviously very loyal because the NSA is interested in
                    him. Well, that raised an eyebrow with the Peace Corps who had been infiltrated
                    in the early '60s, if you remember, at the University of Michigan. The CIA had
                    planted some folks there. They were very concerned. My father had forwarded a
                    letter which had been sent to the house for me in New Jersey, sent it out to me
                    at the Peace Corps training site, and our mail was separated by Portuguese
                    language instructors. That was one of their administrative jobs. The Peace Corps
                    was concerned that there was enough people that were aware of my interest in NSA
                    that it might jeopardize the whole program in Brazil. They couldn't risk it. So
                    they took told me that I could not continue with the program.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I had applied to two schools which offered PhD's in International Relations.
                    There weren't many of at the time. Columbia didn't have one. You can take a PhD
                    in Public Law and Government, but international issues would be only one of four
                    fields. The USC — University of Southern California — and American University
                    were two that offered PhD's. I applied to both and got accepted at both and had
                    told both I was going to the Peace Corps and would not be matriculating. Here I
                    was in Washington, the semester had already begun, and I went up to AU and said
                    look, I told you I would not be attending, can you take me, and they said sure.
                    So they took me into their PhD program, transferred all my hours from Columbia,
                    and that's how I ended up in the doctoral program of PhD. I eventually got out
                    of the draft. I informed my draft board of these developments, but they were
                    slow in reacting. I went for personal appearance and was rejected by my local
                    board in Lowell, but appealed to the State of Massachusetts. By that time I was
                    a year and a half into coursework at AU. The State of Massachusetts, in their
                    superior wisdom, overturned the local board and gave me a 2S deferment saying
                    that I'd have to take all these courses again to take my prelims, my
                    comprehensive exams, if I were to be drafted. By the time I finished the prelims
                    I was 26 and too old to be drafted.</p>
                <p>This is one of the interesting things about the Vietnam War era that I've always
                    found somewhat uncomfortable. They had such excellent counselors on university
                    campuses. If you were in Tigerville, South Carolina or Lubbock, Texas and were
                    not at a university, you probably did not have access to these counselors who
                    knew the draft situation and knew how to maneuver it to the best way possible to
                    avoid it. I was benefited from that. I suspect a lot of folks from rural areas
                    of the United States ended up going in my stead. And I'd probably find some of
                    their names on that wall, the black granite wall, down at the Washington Mall
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was Consul General in Saigon in '69 and'70 and one of my
                        jobs was issuing a lot of passports for the soldiers who were there going on
                        two-week R&amp;R and so in issuing these passports, I would sign them. I
                        couldn't help noting how many of the men going were from small towns I had
                        never heard of. It was not a fair war, and right now we are embroiled in
                        Iraq, and it's the same thing. It's a volunteer army that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. There's something to be said for a draft that's fair, and the number
                    system they eventually worked up I think was a good way of doing it. I was
                    benefited. I recognize that.</p>

                    year I was given a fellowship from the Organization of American States to do my
                    dissertation research in Ecuador. The fourth year I spent writing my
                    dissertation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your dissertation on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The Ecuadorian relations with Peru over a 20 year period from essentially
                    '50 to '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a damn little piece of property. Brazil and who
                        else is a player?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Argentina. And the United States. The ABC: American, Brazil and Chile.
                    Yeah, that's interesting that you know that. It was an interesting piece because
                    one reads Ecuadorian literature, and you read American scholarship on Ecuadorian
                    relations, it's always anti-Peruvian, very strongly negative about Peru. Going
                    back to the war. A few things happened in the period of '50 to '70. Oil was
                    discovered in a small part of land that Peru actually ceded to Ecuador as part
                    of the big deal. Now, Peru got the lion's share, but some part in the northeast
                    part of the country ended up in Ecuador's hands, and Texaco discovered oil
                    there. The thought of calling for a redress of the issue and a re-negotiation of
                    the treaty was never an issue after that.</p>
                <p>The major political issue at the time was not with Peru but with the United
                    States on the fishing limit. Two hundred mile fishing limit. It was Yankees Go
                    Home, and Fuera los Yanquis, and the Peruvians Are Our Brothers because they
                    have the same issues. What I did was play around with that issue, how the
                    images, the elite images—the military, the political and the journalistic views
                    Ecuador toward Peru—changed in 20 years and then described why. It was a nice
                    little piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did an oral history a long time ago with John Melby. He
                        had the Peruvian-Ecuadorian desk in the State Department in 1942 or '43 or
                        something like that. One day he got a telephone call from the Under
                        Secretary, Sumner Wells. Wells said to the effect that, we got a war on,
                        what the hell are these two little countries squabbling about? I want you to
                        stop that war, and hung up. In a way he sort of [inaudible] the people
                        involved, but it happened the way we saw it at the time. But it kept coming
                        up again, and he never could get rid of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes, it was an interesting case. We were concerned about the stability in
                    our southern neighbors during the war, and we didn't want this kind of horse
                    manure going on and tiny little things causing problems. Anyway, the
                    dissertation got the Outstanding Dissertation of the Year for '72 from AU. It
                    got me a little money, and the OAS Fellowship to Ecuador gave me a wonderful
                    experience. I was married in the summer of '70, and then I went to Quito in
                    September and spent nine months there. Had a wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your Significant Other, her background and
                        all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Her name is Joan Salzman, German background out of New Jersey. We met at
                    a summer job when I was in New Jersey. I spent every summer working at a
                    playground manufacturing plant. Worked on the dock: loading trucks, unloading
                    trucks, putting orders together for swing sets, bike racks, etc. These were
                    municipal, heavy duty stuff for municipals, municipalities, colleges and
                    universities, whatever. She was a summer secretary, and I was the summer hire.
                    We met there in the summer of '67 and we started dating in January of 1968, and
                    I married her in June of 1970. She's seven years younger than I am. She'd barely
                    been out of New Jersey. We were married in June and in September we were in
                    Quite, Ecuador.</p>
                <p>She had no Spanish, so I urged her to take some courses at the university there
                    which she did. She got enough to get around, and for some reason she gained lots
                    of weight there and I lost of weight. Both of us ended up going to a doctor to
                    find out what the story was and he had no real explanation, although he said it
                    was common for females to gain weight and males to lose it the first year or so
                    in Quito. I'm not sure we ever had an explanation that was reasonable, but he
                    said it wasn't uncommon, so we didn't think any more of it. We weren't ill
                    either of us, just put on weight and I lost it.</p>
                <p>We traveled all around the country on the bus. She would view the experience
                    today far less positively than I. I had a great time exploring. One time we took
                    a bus into the oriente, into the eastern side of mountains there, the Andes, as
                    far as the bus routes would go. On one occasion it was three days by horseback
                    to the next city, and I would have loved to get on a horse and gone to the next
                    city three days away, but there was no way I was going to get my wife to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across the embassy, the operations of the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes, I went in once just to I guess to register ourselves, just to let
                    them know we were there. But that was the only association I had with the
                    embassy at all. We had a friend who we'd been referred to out of AU. He had a
                    friend in Ecuador. We got to know them, and the man's wife's father had been
                    head of USIA in Quito. His family had stayed there, his daughter stayed when
                    they moved on. She eventually married an Ecuadorian man, and we got to know them
                    pretty well and through them, others. We had wonderful experiences in Ecuador.
                    We went with these two couples once up to the northwest part of the country
                    where you could only get to their property when the ocean tide was out. It was
                    right on the Pacific coast. He sent his guys out one afternoon and brought back
                    a sea turtle that they cooked up and we had that night for dinner. They chopped
                    the legs off, and the kids drank the blood from it! Clearly, there was some
                    civilization at some point on their property. He said if you want some
                    artifacts, go over here to that cliff. So we went over to this cliff, it was
                    where the waves of high tide would hit it. We spent less than an hour and dug up
                    all sorts of pieces of pottery and I had them verified later by the Smithsonian,
                    and they were all authentic, pre-Columbian artifacts, being little by little
                    washed away into the Pacific Ocean. We had many other wonderful experiences down
                    there. I'd always hoped to be assigned to Quito, but either I was too junior or
                    later too senior for the Senior Commercial Officer position in Ecuador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your dissertation work, were you working particularly
                        on the Ecuadorian side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. Three elite groups I was interested in: the military, the journalist
                    — the elite press — and the politicians, and I did three things. I read random
                    editorials from the two papers in the country for 20 years, one month per year
                    to look for comments on Peru. I read the annual report on the president to the
                    country and the annual report to the Minister of Defense. Then I went to
                    interview people once I got the data and saw the trends and how there was far
                    less hostility than the American scholars would have lead one to believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of a politician's thing that they would stir
                        up from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. Occasionally they would need to do that. There is some truth in
                    that. But that happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the military stand on both sides? Were they
                        really equipped or could they even go to war against each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: No. Ecuador is a much smaller country than Peru, and had nowhere near the
                    military resources that Peru had. What they felt they had was the moral right on
                    their side, and they talked about international law a great deal, rather than
                    who had boots on the ground. They had commonalities of interest fighting the
                    U.S. on the 200 mile territorial water issue and on the moral issue, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your PhD. When?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: May of 1972. I didn't know quite what I wanted to do with it. I thought
                    maybe if I could teach in certain parts of the country and teach certain
                    subjects, I would do that. So my initial interests in the early spring before I
                    graduated in '72 was to find a teaching job in Montana or Washington or Oregon
                    or somewhere out west where I could teach international politics and government.
                    But nobody wanted a professor in those things. If I wanted to teach American
                    Government for five sessions, I was their guy, but I didn't want to that.</p>
                <p>So nothing came of that. I looked at AID and was told almost uniformly by people
                    that I talked with, don't even apply to AID, they'll be out of business in two
                    or three years. This was, I think, '72. So I did something unusual. I took a
                    Civil Service exam along all the things I was doing. I didn't take the Foreign
                    Service exam, and I can't explain why, but I did take a Civil Service exam and
                    scored high enough to be considered for what was called the Management Intern
                    Program. It's now the Presidential Intern program. It was a fantastic program
                    because you choose what department you want to work for, and they start you as a
                    GS-9 I think which is a pretty good salary. Then you rotate within that area for
                    a year, and then you choose what job you want to go into, the jobs that you had
                    that year, and that's where they start. They guarantee a promotion at the end of
                    that first year to an 11. I said wow, this sounds pretty good, so I looked at
                    the DOD, had a very nice interview with someone at the Pentagon who — remember
                    this is '72— said the following: “If you were Black, Dr. Slaght, we would hire
                    you tomorrow.” Very interesting comment. They clearly needed diversity in their
                    program and were not interested in white Anglo Saxon Protestants.</p>
                <p>I looked at the Postal Service because they had a small international program. I
                    looked at HEW. They had a very small international program. I looked at the
                    Commerce Department. They had a Bureau of International Commerce, and they had a
                    pretty good size Latin American Division. I ended up going with them. I was
                    hired in July of '72 as a Management Intern with the Bureau of International
                    Commerce of the U.S. Commerce Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this would be a good place to stop this
                        time, and we'll pick this up in 1972 when you entered the Management Intern
                        Program for the Department of Commerce. We'll continue from there.
                        Great!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Today is the 7th of July 2005. Dale, what was your initial impression of the
                    Department of Commerce? When you went there, and then we'll talk about the
                    Intern or the Management Program.</p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The initial reaction was one of, oh my Lord. A very large bureaucracy, a
                    multiplicity of different functions. Hard to imagine a management team able to
                    hold together the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the
                    Census Bureau and the Bureau of International Trade among others. I was assigned
                    to one of those units, the Bureau of International Commerce Department — they
                    call it BIC. My initial reaction was one of horror, at such a large organization
                    of myriad goals and objectives, and functional differences. I was assigned only
                    to one of those bureaus and actually my all career with the Commerce I had
                    almost nothing to do with any of these other agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a small world in the big world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's what it turned out to be. Once in a while I'd get information from
                    the census people, trade data, but other than that, I had virtually no contact
                    with most of these other divisions that Commerce has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about how the program worked for you? What did
                        you initially do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The program required us to have four or five different assignments within
                    the Bureau of International Commerce. The idea was to choose subsequently among
                    those assignments for a permanent slot. You selected on the bases of what best
                    suited you and where you felt you could be most productive and effective. So I
                    rotated through the Office of International Trade Policy — OITP as they called
                    it — worked in the legislative branch writing comments on bills that had been
                    proposed in the House, mainly in the House. I worked on comments on a bill to
                    protect the honey industry. I remember doing a lot of research on bees and the
                    honey industry and other such very narrowly defined projects. So we contacted
                    industry, contacted other groups, did a little bit of economic analysis of the
                    likely impact on the sector and submitted this up the chain and it found it's
                    way with other agency input to the Office of Trade Representative that had just
                    been created about that time. They in turn would have consultations with the
                    House Ways and means Committee on the administration's view of the bill. The
                    Bureau handled trade promotions abroad, such as Trade Fairs. They would organize
                    U.S. pavilions in our Trade Centers around the world. We had one in Sydney, we
                    had one in London, we had one in Mexico City and other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Milan, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: You're right. Milan, and maybe in others, too. I was involved in some of
                    the recruitment of U.S. firms to go over and participate in U.S. Pavilion
                    whatever show it was. I had a stint in the Export Control Office. These were the
                    folks that looked at exports of U.S. sensitive technology. A company wants to
                    sell computers to Poland or wherever, so a judgment had to be made whether there
                    was the likelihood of the diversion of equipment to other countries. I probably
                    had other assignments, but those are the three that I remember. Oh, I had
                    assignment in the Latin American Division. That was where I had a particular
                    interest. They had a Latin America division among the offices of International
                    Trade Policy that looked at trade policy vis a vis countries in the Western
                    Hemisphere primarily. We'd do lot of counseling in that office. Companies would
                    call and say, look, I want to export whatever, typewriters, to the Dominican
                    Republic. What are the duties there? What are the other barriers that I would
                    face selling my equipment into places like the Dominican Republic. We'd counsel
                    them on those issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take if company Y is selling typewriters to the
                        Dominican Republic. What sort of information would you have, because as long
                        as you can look in the books and find out the tariffs and all that, but
                        there's also the atmosphere which is probably the most important one. Is it
                        a bribery prone place, and they might keep you out? I think you need to have
                        contact, that type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: We had tariff books on each of the countries in the Western Hemisphere,
                    so we could look up in the book and find out what the tariff rate was. But we
                    also had reports from the embassies. This was then pre-Foreign Commercial
                    Service, so these were State Department officers working primarily in the
                    commercial sections in those countries doing reports on trade barriers in that
                    country and non-tariff barriers in that country so that if tariffs weren't
                    prohibitively high, we would look at other things, another common query: Do you
                    need to have an agent to import your product and if so, what were the
                    requirements of a U.S. company hiring an agent in terms of if you wanted to let
                    him go, what kind of implications would that have financially for you and all
                    these sorts of things. We didn't have all the information all the time, but we
                    had most of the information most of the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after all of this, it took you what, about a year or
                        so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That was a year.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: The end of that first year Commerce asked me if I'd like to go for a
                    summer to work on The Hill. The Ways and Means Committee was writing the Trade
                    Reform Act of 1974, and I said sure. So I spent the summer as an Executive
                    Branch transferee in the office of Sam Gibbons of Florida. Gibbons was a
                    Democrat and a leading trade proponent in the House to the point where many
                    members really looked to him for guidance on many of these trade issues and
                    would follow his lead. I had a wonderful experience with him. He was a fine man,
                    a good legislator, and honest man. I was able to see the inside workings in the
                    House Ways and Means Committee for a summer which I found fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the things you saw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I remember once Charlie Vanick of Ohio who was not a free trade proponent
                    badgering a witness and then going back to the anteroom and getting on the phone
                    and talking with his broker about mundane matters that had nothing to do with
                    the...actually, it was about the purchase of a boat, and I found the
                    juxtaposition of his flamboyantness and his strong feelings anti-trade and then
                    going back and doing private business on the phone. I thought that was
                    interesting. I found a great deal of deference, as I indicated before, to
                    Gibbons who later became the head of the sub-committee on trade for the House
                    Ways and Means Committee. I found the workings of the staff very interesting.
                    These were in most respects very young people who were unbelievably committed to
                    what they were doing. The hours that these folks worked when Congress was in
                    session and when key legislation was being discussed was phenomenal. Working
                    conditions were bad, there was very little space. I suspect all these conditions
                    still apply today up there. Very dedicated, very bright people. The collegial
                    nature by and large of the members I found surprising. These were people that
                    had strongly divergent views in some cases, but they all treated each other with
                    respect and deference. I would say the difference today from what I saw in the
                    summer of 1973 is very wide compared to what's going on today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: One of the issues dealt with was how to protect some sectors of our
                    economy if we negotiated a new multilateral trade agreement. Most agreements
                    will impact negatively some aspects of some sectors of our society. That's a
                    given. How do we help those sectors? Representative Gibbons, was a very strong
                    proponent of trade adjustment assistance, and he was careful to insert in the
                    bill's language legislative language that would provide trade adjustment
                    assistance for individuals and for communities adversely affected by trade. The
                    company or the individual would have to prove that the economic or loss of jobs
                    had a direct relationship to the trade agreement, in this case, the Trade Reform
                    Act of '74. But after that was proven, the worker got training for a new skill,
                    relocation assistance if he and his family needed to go from Aiken, South
                    Carolina, for example, to Midland Michigan or Midland, Texas, or wherever, and
                    that would be provided. Communities also would be given assistance. The other
                    novel element was what was called Generalized System of Preferences, GSP, where
                    certain countries around the world were told they could export their products to
                    the United States virtually duty free without giving reciprocal benefits to us.
                    These were the lesser developed countries, and that was a novel idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find while you were there some of the great
                        barons, I think of rice, I think of sugar. I'm sure there were other ones.
                        People would come. For years they would continue to manipulate things. Were
                        there some of those untouchable areas, people too powerful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I don't have any direct knowledge of that at the time, but I'm sure
                    Representative Gibbons got calls from the Florida sugar producers and the
                    phosphate producers, very strong industry around the Tampa area where Gibbons is
                    from. I wasn't involved in those discussions, but I'm sure they were held.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this experience, this gave you quite an insight. Did
                        you found the fact that you were detailed to Congress for a year, a very
                        positive experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: For a summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a summer. A very positive thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I saw it as a reflection of the new management that I had found, an
                    appreciation of my skills and an attempt to develop them. After all, I'd come
                    out of an academic background. I had not come out of a business background like
                    many of my colleagues in the management intern program. Clearly I needed some
                    seasoning, and I think this was one of the ways they helped me obtain that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel early on about the leadership of the
                        Department of Commerce because it's always the people I talk to. It's always
                        been a problem in that at the top, a lot of positions there it's sort of the
                        place of last resort for putting the political appointees in. You have the
                        bureaucracy doing their thing and then you get these political appointees.
                        Some of them were very good and some were astoundingly poor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I don't remember who the secretary was when I arrived in '72, but I think
                    it was Pete Peterson who was excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of the top people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes, he was a deep thinker and a novel thinker. I think he's now head of
                    the Blackstone Group in New York, but we had our Maurice Stans in this period,
                    former Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Juanita Guess, I
                    think it was, but not until I was abroad did I have any contact with these
                    people. Once I was abroad, then you'd see these people leading missions or
                    coming through, and then you got to deal with them and you got a different sense
                    of some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact or were your colleague talking
                        about the State Department and it's hold on foreign commercial
                        services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Those conversations were probably going on because in 1980 State lost
                    that function, so we're only talking a few years later. I was not privy to them.
                    We viewed the State Department as allies because they were a source of
                    information what we couldn't obtain otherwise. As with any organization, we knew
                    where to call, and we knew where not to call because we had experiences with
                    good officers and officers which had less interest in the commercial side. With
                    respect to talk about the commercial function Commerce would play a role, it
                    doubtless was occurring, but I was not involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this trying period, what did you decide to do, and how
                        did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Eventually, I went back to the Office of International Trade Policy where
                    I had a very interesting year. I ended up working for much of the time with the
                    USTR, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and with a fellow named Dick
                    Matthieson who was in charge of some negotiations the United States was having
                    under GATT article 24, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade with the
                    Europeans. The EU-6, the original members of the European Commission, and the
                    European Free Trade Association, EFTA, had agreed to a relationship, a trading
                    relationship, and part of that relationship included what is called “Rules of
                    Origin”. This is a highly technical issue, but it boils down to how does one,
                    for example, define an Austrian product that wanted to enter France? What
                    percent of the product needed to be Austrian? This had impact on us. We would
                    sell components or materials to Austria or some of the other EFTA countries, and
                    then a Rule of Origin might prohibit that product from being exported to a
                    member of the European Union. Article 24, as I recall, of the GATT provided for
                    consultations on these questions, and I spent, I would think, 6 months of this
                    period going to European capitols as the Commerce representative with Dick
                    Matthieson as the lead, and talking with them about these rules and then going
                    to Geneva for meetings under the consultation provision of the GATT. This was a
                    very interesting experience for me since I had not had much experience with
                    international trade issues and no experience on international travel to Europe
                    and dealing with European countries on trade matters. So it was a marvelous
                    training experience for me in dealing personally with European counterparts on
                    trade issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this particular aspect of origins, what were sort of
                        essentially the problems? Was this a European guild that was trying to keep
                        America out or others out or was this straightened out of bureaucracy, or
                        were there current issues around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: At the time, the U.S. had no international trade agreement of the kind
                    that would require Rules of Origin. We had no free trade agreements with any
                    other country. Most of our concern was a view that the Europeans had designed
                    these rules to reduce our entry into their markets. For example, textile
                    products needed to use so much domestic origin yarn. You couldn't have more than
                    some percentage of lace on certain products. The rules were unbelievably
                    complicated. Manufacturers would have to keep track of where they got all their
                    imports, if they had components coming in from various places, assembled there,
                    and then wanted to export them. If you had a rule with only 50% of the product
                    can come from abroad, then the poor domestic manufacturer in Austria, for
                    instance, would have to keep track of every screw and every bolt and every
                    plastic widget that he got, and then determine at the end whether all those
                    inputs were less than 50% for him to qualify. We viewed all this as an attempt
                    to eliminate our component manufacturers from the European market. We have a
                    different view of this now, of course, because we have free trade agreements
                    with many countries, and we have complicated Rules of Origin ourselves. Ours,
                    I'm absolutely convinced, are modeled after what the Europeans did in the
                    1970s.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Very friendly, very polite. It was quite an interesting exercise. The
                    language, although we had strong feelings about all these things, the language
                    that our leaders used, USTR and State Department Officers would go on these
                    trips, were always quite careful. No one was pounding the tables, no one was
                    yelling. It was all quite calm and pleasant. We wouldn't agree all the time on
                    matters, but it was all quite professional.</p>

                        but a generalized trade expert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Certainly an expert on the Rules of Origin. This was a long time ago.
                    This was 1974, I guess, but I did this for some time after the initial movement
                    into that unit. I spent some time back in the Office of Legislative Affairs.
                    This was all part of the Office of International Industrial Trade Policy. I went
                    back to the division, spent a little time more on legislation. When I joined the
                    Commerce Department in '72, I really didn't plan to stay there more than three,
                    four, five years. I knew the thought of, in particular after being there a
                    while, the thought of working in a large bureaucracy like that for a career
                    was...I just couldn't see it. I expected to go on to business somewhere, as the
                    Latin American representative of some company. About '75, I started hearing
                    about a program that Commerce had with State called the State Commerce Exchange
                    Program. At the time, State had more officers that wanted to come back for
                    Washington assignments than the Department of State had positions for them in
                    the building. At any time there were no more than thirty State officers sent to
                    Commerce Department who'd be the head of the Japan desk or the head of the
                    Mexico desk or whatever, and an equal number of Commerce people would go abroad
                    on temporary assignments as commercial attaches. I heard about this program
                    probably in late '75, and in '76 I started having pretty serious conversations
                    with our Human Resources people about that. They said fine, we'll pursue it, and
                    they did. I eventually was put on a list of Commerce people who would, they
                    thought, would be acceptable to State for the program and I was interviewed by
                    Winston Lord, believe it or not, on an assignment in, I would guess this would
                    be '76. State accepted me. I began language training in the spring of '77, and I
                    went to Montevideo, Uruguay in September of 1977 as Commercial Attach�. I had a
                    wonderful experience. The Ambassador there was Larry Pezzullo, and his deputy,
                    James Cheek were really first-rate people.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Yes, they did. I had a wonderful time. Pezzullo was a fantastic
                    ambassador. He and I had a mutual interest in tennis, and in back of the
                    residence was a miniature tennis court, a paddleball court, really. You used
                    tennis balls that a had a hole in them so they were somewhat dead. He and I and
                    usually one guy from the marine detachment and whoever we could gin up would
                    play Sunday afternoons for several hours. We got to know each other pretty well.
                    He was a very good man, a very good ambassador. Uruguay at the time had a
                    military dictatorship and was on the opposite side of the Human Rights issue
                    that President Carter was pursuing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's right. There was still the threat of their activities, but more of
                    the activities, if you can call them, were being approved by the military
                    government. They would arrest people. The scale of the violence was not anything
                    near what was going on the other side of the river in Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of them disappeared? People and all..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: There was repression. We were, as a government, at odds with the
                    Uruguayan government on this question. So Pezzullo and Jim [Lyle Franklin] Lane
                    who followed Pezzullo a couple of years later needed to be careful how they
                    pursued these issues.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: My role was to promote U.S. trade and I did that two ways: I did it in a
                    practical way by advising and helping U.S. individual companies to get into the
                    market to sell whatever they wanted. I did that my making contacts within the
                    business community. I joined a little group called APICUE which was a pro-US
                    business group — a very small group but lovely, lovely people, wonderful people.
                    I had such a good time with those men. I was a young man at the time, and they
                    were, I guess in their 50's and 60's. We were in quite different age groups, but
                    they respected and they respected my positions, and we had a meeting usually
                    once a week in their little meeting hall. It was as much for them a social time,
                    but we talked trade issues and political issues. It helped establish contacts
                    for me. One of the members there, an active member, was the Caterpillar
                    representative of the country, and I was able over the three years to help a
                    U.S. firm sell goods to the Caterpillar representative as a kind of sideline to
                    his construction equipment business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember I interviewed somebody, I think it was the
                        ambassador to Uruguay, at some point. He was very proud of untangling the
                        problem with I'm not sure if they were exporting or importing creosote ties
                        or something like that. I mean, was the bureaucracy there the kind that was
                        tying things up or were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No, usually not. Usually not. They had pretty high tariff rates there. It
                    was one of the reasons you saw antique cars. I eventually bought a 1929 Ford
                    convertible there for $800, but they had such cars run in the street because
                    there was 100% duty or more on cars. Ford had a very small manufacturing
                    facility there, but they produced, I don't know, 40, 50 Falcon cars a year there
                    or something. There was an American Chamber of Commerce there, and I was active
                    in that. It was the kind of place, a small country where you got to know just
                    about everyone. I can remember on my going away party that the head of the
                    Finance Ministry and the head of Central Bank came to say good-bye. For me this
                    was a heady time as a junior officer, and I was given quite a lot of latitude by
                    the ambassadors there. They would take me on calls that they would make to
                    companies in the interior. I organized the pavilion of U.S. companies at a major
                    agricultural trade fair that they had once a year. It was the first time it was
                    done, and I ended up getting a Meritorious Honor Award from the State Department
                    over this. It was a wonderful experience. It really set the tone for my interest
                    in a full-time career. I always had this, but after the taste of actually doing
                    it, there was no turning back to this challenge of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we at all involved or impacted by I think of the
                        smuggling that went on between Brazil and Argentina, Paraguay in the middle,
                        but also the reflections in Uruguay and all that. Did that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: No, no. There was smuggling going on, particularly on the Brazilian
                    border. Shoes, coffee and other things. They could always be found on the
                    northern cities. Everyone suspected that they were brought over with the eyes
                    closed of customs officers there. And they'd find their way down to Montevideo,
                    the capital. The country had three million people, and a million and half were
                    in Montevideo, so it was a one city country in many respects. I got to know very
                    well the head of CitiBank and Bank of America there. We're still friends with
                    the Bank of America representative. It was a small American community, and I
                    made sure that the ambassador had face-to-face meetings with as many of these
                    Americans as possible. We set up a monthly meeting in the conference room in the
                    embassy with a group of them, so they had their input in to the ambassador. He
                    was able to explain what he was doing, what the U.S. government was doing. It
                    was a healthy environment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Carter administration. Were you there
                        when Rosalynn Carter made a trip to Latin America?</hi>

                <p>SLAGHT: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Assistant Secretary of State Todman came through. He was the most senior
                    U.S. government who visited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs.
                        Did the Carter administration's emphasis on human rights and all have any
                        impact on your operations, the embassy operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: It certainly had impact on the embassy operations, but it had very little
                    to do with the commercial side. I was, if you will, running commercial as if we
                    had no conflict with the Uruguayan government, but human rights was the issue in
                    our bilateral relationship. Poor Jim Cheek. He came out of that assignment in
                    Uruguay as DCM and into the State Department as the deputy to Pat Derian in the
                    Human Rights Office, a new office created by Carter. And because of that, the
                    Reagan administration wouldn't touch him later as ambassador.</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: And he ended up going to Kabul and then to Addis Ababa and those
                    hell-holes, if you will, and only after Reagan left and Clinton came in was
                    there restitution. He was named our ambassador to Argentina in the first years
                    of the Clinton Administration. Pezzullo went on to Central America and issues
                    with the insurgent Sandinistas. And I don't know what happened to him
                    afterwards. But at least Cheek was adversely affected. These people when they
                    went to Argentina, when Carter went to Argentina and Cheek was there, these
                    people were viewed as heroes. It was very interesting how those people were
                    remembered. These were individuals who stood up for human rights protection, and
                    they were respected for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: At the end of this tour, Carter decided that the commercial function of
                    our government was not being well served by the State Department. With Congress'
                    support, Carter pulled that function out of State and gave it to Commerce, and
                    the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service was created. This was 1980. I was in my
                    last year in Montevideo. There was an interview process, an oral exam, that was
                    given to anyone interested. I'm not sure anyone; I guess you had to be asked to
                    be examined. I cleared that hurdle and I flew to Miami for a full-day oral exam
                    with three or four others in the group. I passed the oral exam and then was
                    subsequently asked to join, the first class of commerce officers. In the
                    meantime, I'd been asked while this testing was going on, I was asked to take an
                    ongoing assignment in Panama. The idea was to leave in the middle of the year,
                    and my kids were in kindergarten, and I said, can't we wait until the end of the
                    school year? And the answer from the Commerce Department was, they're young,
                    they'll get over it. I was indiscreet on how I passed on that conversation, and
                    my wife never forgot it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: It wasn't quite the days where a wife's performance was included in
                    officers' reviews. We were past that, but not too much past. She was horrified,
                    and besides, she had thought this was a one-time deal for three years in
                    Uruguay, and then we would return home in the States.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Yes, now that it's over. She was not happy that I had decided that the
                    family would go to Panama. But we went to Panama, and while I was there I was
                    given the offer to join the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a fact of the matter, you probably were at the top or
                        thereabouts. You'd done your thing already. You'd proved yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. I remember one guy who was assigned someplace else who didn't get
                    through the exam. I think there were four of us that tested, and three of us got
                    through, the fourth didn't. He ended up going back to work on the desks in
                    Commerce, country desks. We talked about it. It was just a performance thing for
                    us. We're doing the job, we're all doing it well, it shouldn't be an issue, and
                    I guess it was much more serious than the four of us had thought. Maybe it
                    helped us relax a little bit and helped us do well on the exam, but one of the
                    four didn't make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suspect the commerce people were doing this.
                        Obviously, the first people to do this, they're on trial. We got to put our
                        best face forward. One last question about Uruguay, Dan Mitrione had been
                        kidnapped and killed. He was the head of the U.S. Public Safety Program in
                        1970. How about security precautions and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: You know, we never thought much about security, certainly not political
                    security. Our house toward the end of our assignment was broken into early one
                    Sunday morning while we were there, and it did terrify us more because the
                    thieves had broken in through an open window in our bedroom and walked right
                    past our bed and down the stairs and found a wall safe they tried to get into
                    and started to come up the stairs. Our kids, our two boys, were sleeping in a
                    room that ended up between the thieves and us. It was hard on me, too, but it
                    was particularly hard on my wife. I was ready to get on the next plane out of
                    here when that happened. Luckily, we didn't have many more weeks to go, and we
                    moved quickly into temporary quarters and got out of the house. I remember for
                    the couple of weeks that we were still in the house, we slept with a baseball
                    bat underneath the bed, and we awakened with every little sound on the
                    street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Panama, and you were there from what, 1980
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. 1980 to 1982. It would have been a three-year assignment, but I
                    curtailed. We'll go through that later. Torrijos was still running Panama when
                    we arrived. There was strong anti-American feeling. Carter had just signed the
                    treaty giving back to Canal Zone to Panama. At least that was done. There was
                    still a lot of hostility toward Americans in the streets of Panama, and a lot
                    more crime. So we went to Panama with a little more trepidation than we had gone
                    to Uruguay.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We ended up putting our two boys in schools in the Canal Zone, DOD schools, which
                    turned out to be a big mistake, primarily because they had gone to Uruguay and
                    spoke Spanish fluently among their friends, that's what they played in. They got
                    to Panama, and Spanish was viewed by the DOD staff as something those folks did
                    on the other side of the fence. They quickly learned that Spanish was not
                    appreciated, the language was not appreciated, although they had to do their
                    obligatory whatever it was, half hour a day in Spanish in the classroom. It
                    wasn't taken seriously. My boys left Panama with less Spanish than they arrived
                    with, even though they were two years older and a lot more wise. We didn't see
                    that coming. One of the costs of a Foreign Service life. One of the benefits is
                    you learn languages, and we thought that would come kind of naturally, playing
                    in the streets. They played with friends from the school. They didn't have
                    friends in the neighborhood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: He was a very good man. He's now the dean of a school in Florida. Ambler
                    Moss. A very good man, an attorney, legal background, very calm, very polite,
                    nice family, young wife with kids, and a good man. We got along well.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Panama has an interesting relationship with the United States. The
                    business community as in much of Central America and Mexico have strong ties
                    with the United States. If they own property in Panama, they'd also have a condo
                    in Miami, or farther up Central America you go, it might be in New Orleans or
                    Texas or California. So for me, making contact and doing business with the
                    Panamanian business community was not that dissimilar than doing business with
                    Americans. They weren't Americans, but they had such familiarity with U.S. and
                    U.S. culture that it was as if they were Americans. If they had children, they'd
                    have been educated in the United States. They might have been educated
                    themselves in the United States. It wasn't very different than if I were dealing
                    with Americans. Panama has one other distinct feature: They have a very large
                    free trade zone on the other side of the Isthmus in Colon where millions of
                    dollars of trade comes through that zone and is either transformed or not
                    transformed and then shipped off to Columbia or Venezuela or Peru, or whatever,
                    as a trans shipment port. There were U.S. firms that had large operations in
                    there. So I worked with those folks as well as other business people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of issues did you find yourself involved
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: The experience there was not atypical from others. We'd have an
                    occasional trade dispute of one kind or another. Customs would try to hold up a
                    shipment of goods of one kind or another. We'd have to talk with them about why
                    are you holding this up? We had the normal tariff and non-tariff barrier issues
                    with goods coming in. We spent a lot of time finding local agents and
                    distributors for U.S. companies looking to establish for the first time some
                    market access, market penetration there. I don't recall major issues. I was
                    there just two years. Toward the end of the second year I was called by the head
                    of the Western Hemisphere Unit in the Commerce Department for whom I had worked
                    in the Office of International Trade Policy. She had been told by the head of
                    the bureau that they wanted some people with some foreign service or embassy
                    experience to come back to take key jobs on the desks. They wanted me to come
                    back and head the Mexico desk. I clicked my heels together, and saluted, and
                    said yes, sir, I'll come. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>First month I was back, I ran into the Director General in the hallway, and he
                    said, Dale, what are you doing here? I said well, according to Dave Ross, who
                    was the assignments guy, you wanted me to come back. He said I don't know
                    anything about this. Ross, one of the first things I learned about Ross was not
                    to trust him. He was later mustered out of our service for funny dealings in
                    Milan, and I was one of those on the sideline, one of many who cheered that
                    decision by our department. I thought he lied to me years ago. But I came back,
                    headed the Mexico desk, just at the time the Mexico economy went down the tubes.
                    I spent the next two years helping U.S. companies get paid for goods they had
                    already shipped, and dealing with nasty financial issues, and fighting with
                    State, Treasury, USTR and AG depending on who's on what on turf. Who's going to
                    handle what issues? I found it very, very unpleasant. The operations abroad were
                    small enough in both places — Uruguay and Panama — that there was a very strong
                    collegial relationship although I was State, there was a Treasury guy there, DOD
                    people. We were all viewed as a team, and we functioned that way.</p>
                <p>We get back to Commerce, I remember Ann Hughes who was the DAS for the Western
                    Hemisphere and very interested in Mexico, and who had recruited me to take this
                    job, tell me you can't tell State about this because that might give them a leg
                    up on this issue. I found it very unpleasant. I would guess about a year and a
                    half, maybe even less, into that tour, I decided this wasn't for me. I had such
                    wonderful experience abroad, what am I doing back here? I ran into the Deputy
                    Director General, and he asked me, as part of a casual conversation in the hall.
                    How ya doing? So I unloaded. He said we can fix this, where do you want to go?
                    I'd been looking at onward assignments and said Vienna, Vienna is coming due, I
                    could take some German language training and go to Vienna. He said it's yours.
                    This is how assignments were done in Commercial Service in the early years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked with people back in the olden days of Foreign
                        Service where people would be up on whatever's the equivalent of the seventh
                        floor before that, and would say they would be at the urinal next to Laurie
                        Henderson and would say, how are things going? Well, I'm ready for another
                        assignment. Well, I got one. That's the way it was handled before gender
                        discrimination...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: For transparency, too. Well, that sounded good, so the next day or the
                    day after, he called me and said I'm sorry, I promised Vienna to someone else,
                    but Munich is open. Do you want to go to Munich? Still, give you language. I
                    said sure. I was interested in the language because I had Spanish but didn't
                    have a second language, and I thought that might me important. And secondly, it
                    might get me out of my job six months early cause I go to FSI Language. I said
                    find. That's how I got assigned to Munich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about the Mexico thing. What precipitated
                        the problem that you spent most of your time dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: This was 1982. Mexico had for most of its — here in the Twentieth Century
                    — what is called an Import Substitution Policy. That is, they had very high
                    tariffs to protect industries, many of which were owned by the Mexican
                    government. It was very hard getting goods into Mexico. You needed an import
                    permit from the government before you imported anything there. Industries grew.
                    They developed a pretty good auto assembly industry and other industries, and
                    things were all right until the bottom fell out of the oil market in the early
                    '80's, and they lost the revenues that they had been receiving from their oil
                    exports. They realized that over time, their import substitution policy was not
                    sustainable. They eventually jettisoned it and joined the GATT in l986 and have
                    been active free traders since. They have many more free trade agreements than
                    the United States has today. In 1982 they hadn't reached that domestic consensus
                    yet and were trying to hold on, so they didn't have the wherewithal to import in
                    the levels that they needed, and the economy was adversely affected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues that would involve State
                        Commerce and Treasury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I can't think of one at the moment, but I know we had them all the time.
                    We had Mary Chavez of Treasury and John Rosenbloom of USTR and several people
                    out of State. We all would meet at our level, and then there was above ours the
                    DAS's (Deputy Assistant Secretaries) counterpart would meet. I can't remember
                    one issue, but I know they were constant. These kind of turf issues: Who was
                    going to do what, who was to take the lead. For me it was just an unpleasant
                    period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, who gets the credit or who gets the
                        action as opposed to what are we going to do about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The issues were not the larger issue of what our relationship with Mexico
                    should be. It's who would implement it? Who would take the steps necessary to
                    implement whatever policy had been agreed to? It was a real shock to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A learning experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. It was for that reason that when I left Mexico on my last
                    assignment, I did not want to come back to the Commerce Department. I think
                    probably I could have been the DAS or the Acting Assistant, the Deputy to the
                    Director General. Those jobs at my rank were open to me, and there were few
                    available, few other officers at that rank to take them. I knew what kind of
                    issues I would deal with, and it just wasn't for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Life is short. You took German for six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Thirty...no, twenty-four weeks. That's six months, isn't it? That's
                    right. It didn't seem that long. I think it's now thirty weeks. I did well. I
                    came out with a 3.3 and went off what turned out to be the best assignment of my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Munich from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: '84 to '88. Summer of '84 to spring of '88. Not quite four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about the Consulate General in Munich

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: He was a pleasant man who had very little interest in the commercial
                    side, allowed me to do my thing there which was focused mainly on the many trade
                    fairs the Germans have. If I needed him to do a reception, he'd do it, but there
                    wasn't the kind of close, personal relationship that I had certainly in
                    Montevideo. I had less in Panama, maybe because it was a shorter period. It was
                    only two years. I think it also was a function of the personalities. This guy
                    was pleasant.</p>

                        country. They've been around. They've said a lot of things. They've got also
                        a lot of rules and regulations. How did you find dealing with the German
                        apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I think my best experience with the Foreign Service was in Germany. I had
                    a very good staff. The staff was made up of six locals and one junior officer,
                    an American woman. German Nationals, three of which were older, had experienced
                    the war or the immediate aftermath of it, and the other three were young. It was
                    very interesting to see the work ethics of those two groups. The older group was
                    committed to the United States. At the end of the war, the U.S. geographical
                    region of control was southern Germany, so they were active in Bavaria. They
                    knew what the U.S. had done for them. The younger generation only had read about
                    this, perhaps, and were nowhere near as committed. I'm still good friends with
                    the senior FSN. In fact, I saw her this past spring. I went over for the 20th
                    anniversary of a church we helped start there. She is still involved in a
                    program that I helped her get involved in in Munich in 1984. That is export
                    control. One of our principal concerns with the Germans was the transference of
                    dual-use technologies to eastern block countries or to communist countries.
                    Germans are active traders, and they could care less sometimes about our rules.
                    So we established a very...turned out to be a successful program to educate
                    large German companies on the U.S. rules, so that if they used U.S. technology -
                    and most of them did in one way or another - under what conditions could they
                    then take their products that have incorporated U.S. technology and sell them to
                    Romania or east Germany or Poland, whatever. We did a series of lectures to
                    trade organizations that had a wide spectrum of industry members, and we
                    targeted very specific firms. Siemens's headquarters is in Munich, for instance,
                    and we spent a good deal of time with Siemens people. That program was very
                    successful, very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Co-Com.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, Co-Com which set the...was sort of the
                        filter for the program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. Co-Com were the international guidelines that we all had adopted,
                    but they weren't necessarily equally applied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the various firms, I mean,
                        Germany has an intricate set of relationships between their unions, and
                        their companies and all. Did this get in your way or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: No. Our client base has multiple focus points. We're interested in the
                    local agent or distributor that sells U.S. products. We're interested in the
                    U.S. investor who has investment in the region, and we're interested in the
                    large German company that uses our products, and maybe resells them. We did
                    different things for these different clientele. Siemens was just making large
                    investments in the United States in the mid-'80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Siemens being sort of the equivalent of General Electric
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's right. Very large, into all sorts of high technology equipment. At
                    the senior levels they wanted to be a good corporate citizen, wanted to abide by
                    all the regulations on high-tech componentry that we sold them. I wouldn't say
                    we were feared, but they were careful how they handled us. A report back from us
                    that we suspect Siemens is shipping Digital Equipment, VAC computers to Poland
                    without proper authorization would have done serious damage to their export
                    interests. We were always well received, carefully handled. I wouldn't say there
                    were very strong personal ties anywhere with these companies. On this visit back
                    to Munich in March of this year, I had lunch at the senior FSN's home, and she
                    was saying once in a while she runs into this one German — at the time he was a
                    mid-level manager — he is now senior manager of the company, and he comments how
                    helpful our office was to their long-term business interest with the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could your office find out that maybe Siemens night be
                        sending off equipment that shouldn't be sent off, or any other firm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Competitors are tough. This is part of the way that information is
                    gathered. They just won this deal in Poland. Are you aware that they're probably
                    using your computers to do this? Sometimes some levels of the firm wouldn't be
                    as knowledgeable of our rules as they should have been, so we'd be talking about
                    this that and the other, and somebody would casually mention some shipment of
                    whatevers, and we could go back to Commerce. Are you aware, did they get a
                    re-export license to ship these 20 digital machines to Romania?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Noooo, hadn't heard of that! I realize this was being
                        taken care of in Brussels and elsewhere, but from your perspective, how were
                        you viewing the commercial prospective. The European Union was getting
                        bigger. Was it the union then or was it community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Community still, probably.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were drawing up all sorts of rules and regulations.
                        Were you seeing within this inhibitors to American goals, the beginning more

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: This was the mid-'80's, and I wouldn't say that that attitude was
                    prevalent then. We were continually concerned about these Rules of Origin that
                    prevented the use of some U.S. goods, technologies, because of the requirement
                    for a certain percentage being European. Perhaps there was concern about some
                    standards being written that night have had negative impact on our trade, but
                    those issues really developed later as I recall them. Now again, I did less on
                    the policy side in Munich than I had done in either Panama or Uruguay, so these
                    things may have been going on in the economic section of the embassy in Bonn,
                    and I was just unaware of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Munich, did that cover all of southern
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Just Bavaria. We had an office in Stuttgart that handled Bonn,
                    Brittenburg, then offices in the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of trade fairs were going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Germany is known for its trade fairs, and the Munich International Trade
                    Fair Authority had a plethora of trade fairs in different sectors: Sporting
                    goods, firearms, pet supplies, apparel. They had a U.S. manager who lived in the
                    United States who recruited for these shows, for the Munich Trade Fair
                    Authority. Gerald Coleman. He and I became good personal friends. We remain good
                    personal friends. His sons now run the company. They're still active in Munich
                    and elsewhere around the world. They would recruit U.S. participants for these
                    shows, and then we would go to the shows and give a briefing on how to do
                    business in Germany, and he'd give us a booth in the U.S. Pavilion where we
                    would help companies either do interpreting for them or take them by the hand
                    and say this is a great distributor here, you ought to use this guy, or look
                    into this guy, and don't use this guy, that sort of practical assistance on the
                    floor of the show. I would guess a good 40% of our time was involved in trade
                    show work. Then we recruited...cause Germans like trade shows and they know the
                    efficacy of them...we would recruit German companies to go to U.S. trade shows.
                    We had one man, Bernard Kietz, who spent 80% of his time recruiting German
                    companies to go to trade shows in Chicago or Las Vegas, New York, etc. and he'd
                    accompany them, and he'd function as the assistant to them, to the German
                    companies at these shows, doing what we did in Munich for the U.S. companies
                    that came to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it hard to get American firms to come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: No.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germany was a good market. By this time I had commercial
                        experience earlier on, and there was a real problem in that American firms
                        were looking at well, we can export but we've got a big market here in the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That remains a problem. Still, only a small percentage of the firms that
                    could export actually do, and of those that export, most of them export to only
                    one or two countries: Canada and Mexico. We still have a major educational job
                    with U.S. companies to show them the benefits of international trade. They level
                    off the peaks and valleys of our own economy when we're in a low. Perhaps Europe
                    or South America or Asia have strong growth rates, and they continue to sell the
                    same level of product, just not in the United States. You do it abroad. When
                    they're down abroad and the United States is hopefully up, we can maintain
                    employment. That's still a major problem for us as a country. We have such a
                    strong, dynamic economy that it's hard for U.S. firms to look beyond the demand
                    domestically. You've got to deal with foreign languages, strange currencies, and
                    will I get paid, and all these issues that understandably are of concern to U.S.
                    firms, small ones in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, up until '88, how did it look the
                        other side of the Iron Curtain? Was that just a feeling that that was going
                        to be there forever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. We had a conference in Berlin — Commerce did — and I went up to
                    Berlin and took an afternoon trip over to East Berlin across Checkpoint Charlie,
                    and we saw what it was. The wall would fall less than a year later, but no one
                    expected it. It came as a big surprise. No, there was no sense that that was an
                    impermanent relation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one entree that we had to that area I guess was the
                        fair in Leipzig. Was it Leipzig?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Leipzig had a big fair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leipzig Fair. I realize this wasn't in your thing, but
                        what were you getting back about the Leipzig Fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I have no knowledge of anything. Leipzig, didn't do it. We recruited and
                    took staff to the Hanover Fair. Large, high-tech exhibit in Hanover, the largest
                    fair in Germany, probably still is, but we did nothing in the east. Nothing
                    whatsoever. It was no-man's land as far as Foreign Commercial Service was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Commercial Officers, did you form sort of a team
                        within Germany and get together much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. We met I would say twice a year, usually in Bonn or D�sseldorf up in
                    the north. That's where most of our offices were. The guys from Stuttgart and
                    Munich would go north. These meetings would give us the latest from Washington
                    and let the Senior Commercial Officer give us the new rules, whatever they might
                    be, new programs that had been initiated. It was a good collegial relationship.
                    I'm still friends with some of those people that were in Germany in 1984. Our
                    Senior Commercial Officer in Berlin currently was in D�sseldorf and Bonn in that
                    period, and our guy currently in Canada was the guy in Frankfurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel by this time the Commercial Service? Did
                        you feel it was a good thing to be in and a solid promotion impress
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. Uniformly positive, I would say. We got very good feedback from the
                    business community, the U.S. business community, which would ask us, “where were
                    you guys ten years ago?” This was great. Strong support from U.S. based
                    business, as well as businesses that had investments abroad. We still had our
                    ups and downs with headquarters. The case I gave you on how I was assigned there
                    was not atypical, and that's not a morale booster. So we had those sorts of
                    issues. We had Director Generals who in my view were as much concerned about
                    their next job as their current job. That was more the case later, I would say,
                    in the mid-'80's than the beginning. But a positive thing. I was promoted to
                    what amounts to an FSO-1 out of Munich, so I'd gotten a promotion recognizing
                    that my work was regarded well. The personal situation in Munich was so pleasant
                    for us. We were there when the dollar was over three to the mark. It was up to
                    3.4 at one point to the mark, so we didn't think twice about going out to eat or
                    taking a trip to wherever, to Vienna or Salzburg. We went to Rome and Paris and
                    all over Germany. Some weekends we'd just take off and go and really got to
                    appreciate southern German countryside. We learned to ski as a family. Our two
                    older boys learned to ski there. Our third son was born there. We still have
                    very close friends there. We helped start a church as I indicated that had its
                    20th anniversary in March of 2005.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of church was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: It's an English speaking Evangelical Christian church, all sorts of
                    Christian denominations attend: Catholic, Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist. Two of
                    the group were from the Episcopal Church there in Munich. It got started because
                    my wife was active in Cub Scouts, and the Cub Scout Leader was a member of this
                    Anglican church in Munich, and they got talking one day. We were attending the
                    base chapel and weren't really happy with it, and he was unhappy with his
                    church. Soon we had six couples who were unhappy with where they were attending,
                    so we started having Bible studies in our own homes, and it grew to the point
                    where we had enough people to put out a call for a pastor who would raise his
                    own income in the United States and come over, and he did. He came in 1985. It
                    is called the Munich International Community Church, and has grown to 350 to 400
                    people now. That was a very rewarding part of the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel from talking with your other colleagues
                        in the Foreign Commercial Service by this time? Were there conflicts with
                        the economic sections of the embassy or was this pretty much a routine part
                        of the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: There were conflicts, I would say, where there were large economic
                    sections. Where there were small economic sections, there weren't conflicts. In
                    my view, the issue was that the nature of Foreign Service promotion requires you
                    to have a strong annual report, and that requires activity and the ambitious
                    State Department guys would fight for turf. Where there was plenty of work, this
                    did not happen. There was usually more work than all of us could do. But there
                    was less work in large sections and that usually caused problems. To the extent
                    that there were personality issues between the head of the commercial section
                    and the economic session, that would exacerbate the atmosphere. We had no
                    problems with the consulate in Munich, but I know in Bonn there were issues to
                    the point where when the Ambassador called...when the ambassador was told of an
                    officer coming out of Canada where there had been problems, to Germany, he asked
                    to see the commercial officer senior guy first and was told in no uncertain
                    terms there'll be no internecine battles between you and your economic
                    colleagues under my tour. Is that correct, Mr. Bligh? Jack Bligh was the
                    commercial officer coming out of Canada, going to Germany. Jack had a very
                    strong personality, and there were problems there as it turns out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of anything else on that. Then in 1988?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: In the latter part of '87, early '88, I was asked whether I would curtail
                    yet again — I curtailed once in Panama — curtail and go to Toronto to be our
                    head of our Toronto operation which was the largest in Canada. I wanted to go to
                    B.A. as the head of our B.A. operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Buenos Aires. I hemmed and hawed, and they finally said, “look, this is a
                    good job, the U.S. will have a free trade agreement with Canada. We really want
                    your leadership skills there.” So I said okay. This was good for my wife, it
                    brought us back to North America, 8 hours from New Jersey where her parents and
                    sister lived, and this was something she was interested in. This was one of the
                    few things I could do for her. So I finally relented, I said okay. We left in
                    March of '88 and went to Toronto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Toronto from when to when? '88 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: ...to the summer of '91 where I was asked to curtail yet once again to
                    take on our Moscow office, but that's for next time we meet I suspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Toronto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Toronto was a wonderful place, a good staff. For once I could deal in
                    English which was nice, a respite from struggling with German sentence structure
                    and verbs. An international city that had a lot of the flavor of being an
                    international place, and in a very interesting time. In l988 there was a
                    national election in Canada, and the principal issue was whether Canada would
                    join the United States in a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The local party opposed
                    it, and the conservative party supported it. There were major debates in the
                    society on the pros and cons of coming so close together with the United States,
                    what it would do to its cultural industries, what it would do for its business
                    sectors, what it would do for resolving the necessity to restructure much of
                    Canadian industry so they'd be competitive with what they viewed as more
                    competitive U.S. sectors. Fascinating time. Wonderful time to be there. We
                    helped organize a group in Toronto of business leaders who supported it. I got
                    to know some key business leaders as a result of that organization. Eventually
                    they voted for the FTA, for the Canada — U.S. Free Trade Agreement, and it's now
                    almost uniformly supported in Canada. I gave a speech there just last month on
                    NAFTA which is the son of the Canada — U.S. Free Trade Agreement. One of the
                    things I said was one of your parties was strongly opposed it. As soon as they
                    came into power years later, they firmly adopted it, and even some of the labor
                    unions support it. There are still some groups, the academics, who were
                    concerned about the cultural infiltration of U.S. values into their country, but
                    you see very little of that going on.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Reagan and Mulroney who was the conservative prime minister who won in
                    '88 were two Irishmen who liked each other, who got along well, who sang Irish
                    tunes when they met together, and the relationship between the two governments
                    was excellent. We had our soft wood lumber issues and other trade issues, but
                    they were minor compared to the overall relationship and the overall trading
                    relationship.</p>

                        North and South administrations, and Bush ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. Reagan started the good feel if you will between the two countries,
                    but it was Bush who really brought the economic relation to a head with the Free
                    Trade Agreement. It wasn't nearly as close when Bush was president. Bush is not
                    the warm touchy guy that Reagan was, so the relationship wasn't that personal,
                    but it was a good one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was Toronto so important? You think of Montreal as
                        being...maybe not... Is Toronto the main business...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. If you're our age, you think of Montreal, but if fact, with the
                    Separatist movement in Quebec for now 40 years, a lot of the business in Quebec
                    has moved to Ontario. They didn't want to fool with Separatist issues and
                    radical nationalist groups in Quebec. A lot of the banks...most of the
                    banks...are now headquartered in Ontario. Ontario is the manufacturing center of
                    Canada. The GDP of Ontario is just about as large as the rest of Canada put
                    together. It's where the manufacturing base is and where most of the commercial
                    activity remains today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed others who have served in Ottawa where
                        sort of within the chattering classes or the academic pacifists there was a
                        significant amount of anti-Americanism. You define yourself as Canadian is
                        not being an American. How did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Toronto is the focus point of this. University of Toronto, the Toronto
                    Star, the Globe and Mail. These are three elements of the culture in Canada that
                    dominate the anti-American spirit. We saw a lot of that there. It came out in
                    the election of '88 from the liberal point of view. I collected campaign
                    literature from that period and used it in my class on NAFTA at George Mason
                    University I taught several years ago and reminded me of the vehemence in which
                    the socialist class or the liberal class in Canada feared United States
                    dominance politically and culturally. It's still the case. In fact, it's
                    probably more today given the differences on the war in Iraq that we have. The
                    differences on the appropriateness of gay marriage set us now apart further.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>There is no American Chamber of Commerce in Canada. Why, you ask? Because the
                    U.S. companies in Canada want to be viewed as Canadian companies, not American
                    companies. In many U.S. companies, you won't see an American flag flying on the
                    flagpole outside. You'll see the Canadian flag. To this day there's not an
                    American Chamber of Commerce in Canada. There is a group that we started to
                    support to Canada Free Trade Agreement, the Canada — U.S. Free Trade Agreement
                    that had U.S. companies and Canadian companies involved, but that did not become
                    the germ of a large organization across Canada. It folded after the Free Trade
                    Agreement was agreed to.</p>
                <p>Canadians aren't really clear who they are. Quebeckers know who they are, but the
                    rest of Canada has problems defining themselves unless it is vis a vis the
                    United States, and then they're more clear. They view themselves as having a
                    more representative government, a more functional government, Parliamentary
                    system they view as more effective than the system of checks and balances that
                    we have in our system. They view their social safety net as more deep, their net
                    being more finely woven than ours. They pride themselves in their universal
                    health coverage and they talk about how you can live with 40,000,000 Americans
                    without health care insurance. They argue that their concern about the
                    environment is greater than ours. There is a bit of “holier than thou” attitude
                    vis a vis the United States in general. You'll see this particularly in
                    universities and in the intellectual classes and the journalistic elite in
                    Canada. You'll seldom see it or hear it among your friends. They may think it,
                    but they seldom say it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in the schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: We had a very good experience. It was a mix. In Toronto our boys went to
                    a public school for a year, and then we transferred them to a private school. We
                    didn't have any issues there that I can recall. They didn't. Our younger boy
                    years later in Ottawa did have a little bit of that, but mainly because he had
                    been born in Germany they called him a Nazi. This is third grade stuff. We put
                    him in a private school in Ottawa the next two years, and he had a wonderful
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the place where the Canadians
                        seemed to be particularly sensitive? I mean, newspapers, magazines, books,
                        that sort of thing. Was that brought to your desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: It was one of the sticking points of the negotiations for the Agreement.
                    The Canadians said, you will not impact our cultural industries negatively. And
                    we said, if you restrict our access to your cultural industries, we will take
                    action against you. We left it at that. As far as I know, we have never taken
                    trade measures against Canada for their restrictions on advertising in Canadian
                    magazines or U.S. magazines that circulate in Canada, preventing radio broadcast
                    or television access. I listen to Fox News here on occasion, and they announced
                    just a couple of weeks ago they now are in Canada. This was nearly 20 years
                    after the Agreement. The local ambassador here in the Post — did you see the
                    Post the other day? — he was saying that one of his jobs in the United States is
                    counter the Fox mentality that Canadians frequenting the United States pick up
                    about the relationship. He wants to set matters straight because Fox is not
                    telling the story that should be told in his view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Fox being or rather, Rupert Murdock operation is
                        considered by many Americans to be very right wing and very pro-Bush
                        administration by those who don't like Bush, and that would be the Canadians
                        in particular. Must be anathema.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: For some it is, for others it's a rare hope. One thing about Canada is
                    that there are sections of the country who tomorrow, if they could, would be our
                    51st state. Alberta, for instance. They, I'm convinced, if the election were
                    held today or even when we were there, because they are very unhappy with the
                    new energy policy that the Canadians instituted back in the early '80's, and
                    still are unhappy with central government control. These guys are Free Traders
                    and entrepreneurs, and they don't like the meddling that Ottawa does in their
                    affairs. The same could be said for some of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia
                    perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told the Boston Red Sox are the team of neutralization
                        of Nova Scotia. Boston was essentially their capitol.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Canadian state of
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Very good, very easy. It became even a better relationship when I went to
                    Ottawa years later. The Canadian government was interested in this Free Trade
                    Agreement, and we worked closely with Ontario provincial officials and to the
                    extent that I was involved with federal government officials with trade
                    commissioners from the federal government, to promote the FTA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a lot of your work sort of cheer everybody up and say
                        this is a good thing, or were you dealing more with nuts and bolts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: We had to be a little careful how we proceeded, because we didn't want to
                    be viewed that if we wanted it so much that maybe Canadians would say it's not
                    in our interest. There was careful handling of it, but the circles I ran with
                    were, by and large, so strongly supportive of it that I didn't really need to
                    parse my words at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues that engaged you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: How to promote the FTA after it was agreed to was the primary function of
                    our office in '89, '90 and until I left in '91. That involved much speaking in
                    the United States to U.S. Chambers of Commerce and trade groups of one kind or
                    another about the opportunities in Canada. I didn't spend as much time in the
                    U.S. as in Canada, but I spent a lot of time in the U.S. doing speeches at
                    events organized by our domestic operation. We are an integrated service. We
                    have offices not in all but in most of the states. This was a hot topic, a
                    priority, for the administration, so we were required to organize, to the extent
                    possible, regular sessions on selling to Canada. My office and our Canadian
                    office in general was called upon to be the primary speakers for these things.
                    We would go to Detroit or to Grand Rapids or Des Moines and do speeches on how
                    to do business in Canada, how to abide by the Rules of Origin. My experience
                    with Rules of Origin helped because I was able to explain these systems and how
                    it is important to keep documentation and have proper records in case you're
                    audited, so that you can show where your imports came from to avoid fines. I did
                    a lot of that and ended up getting into the Senior Foreign Service on the basis
                    of that experience in Toronto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across the problem that happens in both Canada
                        and Mexico and our representatives or whatever part of the American
                        government find that each department in the United States and other
                        organizations essentially has its own diplomatic relations with the
                        Canadians. Somebody in the Commercial Department may call it “Good old
                        George”, I mean, he's known for years. This has gone on for...did this
                        compete with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: That happened on policy issues. My former friends in the Office of
                    International Trade Policy who helped negotiate this agreement got to know even
                    better their Canadian colleagues and would do that all the time. But, by and
                    large, that did not involve particular company issues, micro-issues if you will.
                    That involved macro-issues, policy questions, how to interpret the agreement in
                    this sector or how to implement it in that sector. That went on all the time. As
                    a matter of fact, the head of the Canada-Mexico office, when he retired from
                    Commerce, was on the payroll of the Quebec government for a couple of years and
                    he advised them how to deal with the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular industries or products that
                        engaged you in lots of things during this transition time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The automotive industry is the largest industry in Ontario, and it's
                    really inter-company trade. It's GM engine manufacturing in Indiana selling
                    engines to GM in Oshawa where they put them in Buicks or whatever and finish
                    assembling. Or it's transmission manufacturers in Toronto selling transmissions
                    down to Ford in Dearborn or whatever. A lot of the interest in U.S. firms in the
                    automotive sector who weren't involved in this trade, wanted access to this
                    trade which they thought would continue to grow as in the past. Our role by and
                    large was to give them contacts in the procurement divisions of the U.S.
                    subsidiary in Canada or the Canadian subsidiary in the United States. We had
                    trade shows in Canada, and the environmental field was very active. We had very
                    interesting technologies in the environmental field, and governors would
                    organize, for instance, the governor of Vermont — I forget her name — came more
                    than once to Ottawa with missions with environmental technologists that had been
                    developed by firms in their state, and that was very well received. We did some
                    recruitment of Canadian firms for U.S. shows like we did in Germany. But we
                    found that Canadians were so used to going to the States, and they have the
                    language, that they did not need our services. So, we spun our wheels a little
                    bit in trying to do these things when we found out they didn't need us. They'd
                    go to Chicago without giving a thought to it, so we eliminated that program
                    shortly after I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is probably a good place to stop. We'll pick this up
                        in '91. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I went to language training at FSI and then to Moscow as our Senior
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 29th of July 2005. Dale?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: I began at FSI, and I guess there were three others in the class and, I
                    would say, six weeks into it, Commerce determined that I needed to be in Moscow
                    before the full course. If I completed the full 44 week course at FSI, I
                    wouldn't get to Russia until after Commerce wanted me there. It's always the
                    case. They always want you there faster, and then when you get there you realize
                    you didn't need to be here. Endemic. So they put me in the Defense Language
                    Training. DLS. I had a tutor for 28 weeks. My tutor was a very interesting woman
                    from St. Petersburg. It was very difficult. When you're in a class with three
                    other students, it's your turn only on the fourth time, but when you're solo,
                    you're on all the time. She didn't know much about the testing procedures at
                    FSI. I'd gone through Spanish and German at FSI, and I knew what was at the end
                    of the road. So I had to tell her, in a sense, we need to work on reading or we
                    need to do this or we need to do that. She was willing to do it, but she didn't
                    have the background to take me through the test. I ended up with a 3/2+, just
                    missing the 3/3 that I needed for the language differential. I got some, but it
                    wasn't the full amount, and I didn't get the full 44 weeks, I think I got 36
                    weeks or 32, something like that, but I had enough to get by. When I got there,
                    I took Russian in the mornings before my office opened for an hour, three days a
                    week, but even that I curtailed after, I guess, about six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Moscow in what, '92? And until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Till the summer of '95. I arrived the summer of '92, and I left the
                    summer of '95.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. That was a big disappoint to me, because when I was assigned the
                    position, of course, I was assigned to the USSR which included Russia and all
                    the other republics, and when I got there, I was in Russia alone, so I missed
                    having responsibility for very interesting places I would have liked to have
                    visited. Ukraine I did go to, but I never got to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in
                    particular.</p>
                <p>Relations were pretty good. Yeltsin was in charge of the government. There was a
                    pretty good understanding between our two governments. The Vice-President met
                    every six months with the Russian Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Al Gore.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: That's right, Al Gore. He met with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
                    every six months either in Moscow or in Washington. We had the leadership of the
                    House, both sides of the House, come every Easter, and the commercial side was
                    very busy. U.S. firms, maybe not unreasonably after the wall came down in the
                    early '90s, believed there were billions to be made in Russia, either through
                    the use of Russian human or natural resources in the country. Russia is a highly
                    educated society: Metallurgists and scientists and mathematicians and computer
                    programmers and, of course, they have oil and gas and diamonds and uranium and
                    titanium out the kazoo. So many U.S. firms saw this as an opportunity to get in
                    early and get in big and make mega bucks. Well, I think only the firms with the
                    deepest pockets made it, and I don't think they made the mega bucks over there.
                    Maybe in the long term they will, but they found working in Russia very, very
                    difficult. The rules, this is a state that had not had any capitalist
                    experience, and the rules of operating were constantly changing, the
                    personalities changed, and, of course, these guys looked to the U.S. Embassy for
                    guidance on what to do and whom to see and what to say, and we were almost as
                    much in the dark as they were. They called on us. They called the ambassador if
                    the U.S. rep was a CEO, and we did our best to guide them. They'd tell us they'd
                    go into meetings with the minister of this or the vice-minister of that and
                    halfway through he conversation, the Russian official would take off his
                    official government hat and put on his private sector hat, and he says my
                    brother-in-law or my brother is in business out there or up there in Siberia,
                    and he can take care of this problem if you'd work a deal with him. And we had
                    the issue with foreign corruption. We had to deal with the Foreign Corrupt
                    Practices Act that prohibits U.S. firms from doing things that other nations can
                    do in terms of greasing the skids with government officials on contracts or
                    things to be done. The relations between the two countries were pretty good at
                    the time, but the pressure on us and the demands on us were considerable. I
                    worked regularly six days a week and sometimes I was in on Sunday afternoons.
                    Very stressful. Then we lost holidays because we'd have Presidents visit us, or
                    Congressional delegations or my own secretary. Very stressful time.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Strauss, Robert Strauss, was ambassador when I first arrived. He's a
                    wonderful man. Very interesting, full of anecdotes which he shares with staff.
                    We had a very good relationship. He regaled us once when he made his first call
                    on the KGB. The new head of the intelligence service renamed brought to the
                    meeting a little bag. In the bag, which he gave to Ambassador Strauss, were all
                    the kinds of listening devices that had been implanted in the concrete walls of
                    the embassy building that had been constructed in the end of the '80s and now
                    stood as a vacant, unused facility on the embassy compound because we found out
                    subsequently that it was bugged. Strauss was very supportive of the commercial
                    operation. Anything he could do to help, he would do. Then we had a little bit
                    of time with charg� Collins — Jim Collins was the charg� before Tom Pickering
                    came. Collins was an excellent charg�, and he was the ambassador after Pickering
                    left. A good man, years in that part of the world, knew the Russian language
                    well. A good man, we got along very well. We lived just two doors down from each
                    other on the compound. A good man.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>And then Tom Pickering came. Tom, of course, has a great reputation in the
                    Service. We did some things with him that were useful. The business community
                    was new, of course, not very large, but very interested in having contact with
                    the embassy, so I organized regular once a month breakfast briefing, in my house
                    that Ambassador Pickering would come to and brief the key business leaders about
                    what was going on. I helped establish an American Chamber of Commerce in Russia
                    while I was there and got a real nice award on my departure for that activity.
                    Pickering reminds me of an anecdote that's worth telling. Toward the eighteenth
                    month of my tour there, I hadn't been out of Moscow, I hadn't been out of
                    Russia. Traveled all over Russia, but never out of Russia, and I really needed
                    to get out with my family. So we decided we would go on a cruise over Christmas,
                    we would go home to the States, go over to Miami, get on a boat, and just be
                    served. Out of the winters in Moscow and the lousy service in the system there.
                    So I made these arrangements in the summer and then hoped circumstances would
                    allow me to leave. Well, the closer we got to December, the more talk there was
                    about Secretary Brown bringing a mission over here to Moscow. I knew his staff
                    well. He had been there once before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Secretary of Commerce.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. I knew his staff well from other trips,
                    so I was in regular contact with these guys. Is he coming? Is he not coming?
                    What's the story? They didn't know. It was going to be a last minute call. Go
                    ahead, I was told, and make your plans, Dale. You have staff to cover if the
                    Secretary does decide to come. So, I said okay. I went off, had my home leave,
                    came back, only to find out that Brown had come, and Pickering never forgave me
                    for that. The next time Secretary Brown came to Moscow, he and I met Secretary
                    Brown and the airport, and the first thing out of Tom Pickering's mouth was, “at
                    least Dale is here this time to meet you, Mr. Secretary”. My wife, who worked in
                    the personnel office, had regular dealings with Alice Pickering on staff
                    assignments there, and she would razz my wife about, you guys left at the wrong
                    time, didn't you. Anyway, I think Tom Pickering never forgave me for that. He
                    would organize groups of senior officers to go off on driving trips for a week
                    or longer out in the hinterlands. They'd take these vehicles with cans of
                    gasoline strapped to the top, and they'd go off. The stories we'd heard they'd
                    drive way faster than should be driven on those roads. One time one of the cars
                    turned over, and no one was injured or gasoline didn't explode. He always tried
                    to corral me to go on one of those, but I just couldn't see risking my life
                    going on one of those things, so I didn't. He was a good man, but I was glad in
                    July of '95 to be on Delta out of there. It was a very difficult assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did a businessman, let's say a representative of a major
                        business, would come to you... We really are interested in the Russian
                        market. What do you recommend? What were you seeing as the challenges and
                        the ability of American business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: The large companies with senior executives knew precisely what they
                    wanted to do when then they got there. They didn't necessarily know how to do
                    it, but they knew what they wanted to do. I remember some Microsystems people
                    coming over from California once, and they had brought a software problem that
                    their software people in Silicon Valley had been unable to solve. They gave it
                    to a group of Russian programmers, and overnight they solved this problem, and
                    the Sun-Microsystems people were blown away. They hired 150 of them to do
                    programming over there for them. Smaller companies were more interested in
                    establishing a relationship with a local firm who would help sell their product.
                    We established a weekly briefing for newcomers, new business-comers to the
                    Russian market to Moscow. Our briefing was carried on CNN. We opened offices in
                    St. Petersburg, in Vladivostok, and in Yekaterinburg, Siberia. A whole series of
                    American Business Centers, ABC, financed by AID, were set up all around Russia
                    and into the former Soviet Union staffed initially by American contractors and
                    later taken over by our local nationals to provide on-the-spot way out in the
                    hinterland counsel, advice and contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This a period when ??? the whole Russian array of
                        businesses and firms and natural resources were being taken over by what was
                        called the Mafia, the Russian people were very good contacts in the
                        government but also were pretty rough in dealing quickly with their own
                        people. Was this so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: A fellow named Anatoly Chubais, a very capable man, was set up in an
                    office of privatization, and government owned facilities were sold, were
                    auctioned off, to private bidders. This caused undue concern particularly by the
                    Communist Party and former Communist Party members who thought that this was
                    giving up the jewels of the economy to the private sector which in their
                    understanding of the way things work would be difficult for labor and contrary
                    to the interests of the state. He still is, the poor man, he's in the government
                    now. I think he heads their utility sector there. He still has to fight off
                    charges of corruption, charges of favoritism, even though that whole
                    privatization effort took place ten years ago, over ten years ago. I would say,
                    by and large, had it not been for those privatization efforts, a lot of these
                    firms would have just collapsed. We were told that managers of firms producing
                    thread were told at the beginning of each year in the old regime how much thread
                    and what color they were to produce with no sense of what the demand for that
                    thread was or would be. This went on through all sectors of the economy where
                    someone in Moscow determined how many pairs of pants, how many shoes. Can't work
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all involved in the teaching or training of
                        the capitalistic distribution system at all?</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Insofar as we would deal with Russian small business people and put them
                    in contact with Americans wanting distributors or agents in Russians, I guess we
                    played some minor role. But we didn't offer classes in entrepreneurship. AID was
                    doing a lot of that in the health sector, in the business sector, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about American firms? As a commercial officer in
                        Saudi Arabia, and we were up against Sharia Laws back in the '50's, but
                        dealing with a country that had it's own legal system which was not
                        compatible with competing with capitalistic problems. How does this
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Texaco wanted to do a joint venture arrangement with a Russian petroleum
                    firm, and they felt the only secure way they would have to satisfy their board
                    that the deal struck would be a firm one and satisfy the long-term interest of
                    the Board of Directors of Texaco would be to enter into a production sharing
                    agreement that had been approved by the Duma. Something that had the formal
                    backing of the Russian government on it so no one could say you did this
                    somewhere up in the North Sea or whatever, and this is null and void. Texaco was
                    working on this before we got there in '92, and they were working on it after I
                    left in '95, and to my knowledge, Texaco never got what it wanted out of the
                    Russian government. As far as I know, no deal was ever done. I went up with
                    their staff to the site, up there near the Bering Sea and met with local
                    officials. We went out to the place where the drilling would take place, and
                    some drilling was already going on by the Russian company. I didn't attend this
                    meeting, but they said on an earlier trip up there they had a town meeting with
                    people in the village, and they were explaining to the villagers what benefits,
                    what additional benefits they would have with an American firm up their working.
                    The U.S. firm was saying we're going to paint your school, we're going to do
                    this that and the other thing, and a guy stood up in the back and said why do we
                    need you to paint our buildings? If we need paint we'll just steal it from the
                    company. That was interesting about Russia. There was a sense in Russia that
                    everything belongs to everyone, so you'd go in apartment buildings, and you
                    wouldn't see lights in the hallways. Why wouldn't you see lights in the
                    hallways? Because people would steal the light bulbs and take them to their
                    apartments. It belongs to us. Nice plants put outside in the summertime wouldn't
                    last a day or two. Someone would expropriate them and bring them into their own
                    house or take them out to their dachas in the country. Very interesting place.
                    Culturally, we had a fascinating time, but it was a difficult place to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, and did you ever make contact with the
                        Russian people, social contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Not too much. With my staff yes. We had Russian staff. Luckily, just
                    before we got there, my predecessor hired four or five people. We were one of
                    the first sections in the embassy allowed to have local staff because our
                    offices were not in the chancellery itself. Remember the case when we had to
                    fire all local staff because we figured most, at least a good percentage, were
                    spies for the KGB. There were about four or five when I got there and left with
                    20, 25 or so, a very large operation. One incident that maybe history will find
                    interesting. As I said, the senior leadership of the house would come every
                    year, and this one occasion we were asked to provide the person we would control
                    with an evening in a typical Russian house for a meal. I went to my staff and I
                    said look, we have to do this. Any suggestions? I contact him and he was yes,
                    more than delighted to do this. It was for Henry Hyde of Illinois. I went out to
                    his apartment building just to check it out, know where to go. A modest place. I
                    know these poor people worked days getting it cleaned and figuring out what to
                    serve Representative Hyde for a meal, and the day of the event, Hyde cancelled.
                    The day of the event. I was so humiliated to have to call this Russian man and
                    say look, he can't come for whatever reason I made up, I don't know.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: We would give them advice. There was an Amcit who was a joint partner in
                    a Radisson Hotel in Moscow. Several other partners were involved, including the
                    City of Moscow was a partner. They tried to push him out, the American, and he
                    refused. He lived in the hotel. He would come to receptions in a bullet-proof
                    vest, and they eventually killed him. This was after we left. They killed him in
                    stairs going down to the subway outside the hotel. The Canadians owned a hotel,
                    the Aerostar, with a Russian group. The practice seems to have been once the
                    Russians figured out how to run the business, they tried to muscle the Americans
                    or the westerners out. Force them out, buy them out at a low price and use
                    violence if they had to to get rid of them. Canadians wanted adequate
                    compensation if they were going to sell. Russians eventually took over the
                    property, and I would guess two years later because I was in Ottawa at the time,
                    the Russians flew a plane into Canada for some reason, and the Canadian
                    government seized it and got their money out of that hostage, if you will,
                    hostage with that plane for the Canadian investors. I thought it was great. Good
                    for the Canadians, I said. You know, lots of violence, lots of unfair practices,
                    but again, there was this drive by the west to get in there and get boots on the
                    ground and get established because there were billions of dollars to be
                    made.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the Russian side? Were they competent people
                        or were almost competence type people trying to take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I guess the majority of people we dealt with, certainly the majority of
                    those whom we recommended to the Americans were honest businessmen looking for
                    new ways to earn livings representing American firms, or the products and
                    services of the American firms, but I'm sure there was an equal number of firms
                    that were crooked.</p>
                <p>The legislative branch was located in a tall, multi-story white building right
                    across from the U.S. Embassy compound. In fact, we could walk out on our
                    balcony, off of our living room, and throw a stone and hit the grounds, maybe
                    two stone throws, at the White House, so we had a bird's eye view, if you will,
                    of the developments in 1993. Anyway, a group that included the vice president of
                    Russia, Rutskoy, decided they didn't like Yeltsin's policies and they were going
                    to put a stop to them and turn the country back into more communist-like. They
                    holed up there and others entered, and they demanded this and that from the
                    government which Yeltsin refused, and finally Yeltsin brought tanks in and
                    lobbed from the bridge that's 100 yards from the building, lobbed missiles in
                    the building, which caught fire. People that could get out got out and they
                    surrendered. They were tried and convicted. The firing sent us into the
                    underground there at the embassy. Underneath the playing field is a gymnasium in
                    Moscow. We all had to go inside the gym. We slept there I think for two nights,
                    maybe three. We had TV access, and CNN was on, and you could see the tanks shoot
                    and then a bit later feel the thud of the tank shell exploding. Toward the end
                    they all tried to get out. The whole White House area including the American
                    compound was surrounded by Russian army troops. To get in to see us, you needed
                    to be escorted. One of us had to go and tell the troops yes, this guy can come
                    in. We had a visit from our pastor of our church and a group from our church in
                    Virginia who was trying to establish a relationship with the Central Baptist
                    Church in Moscow, and they came over during this thing. The pastor, now retired,
                    I see him now and then since he's still active in the church, still talks about
                    that event as if it were one of the highlights of his life. There were snipers.
                    There are tall buildings around the compound, and there were snipers who shot at
                    Americans going between buildings. One Marine was shot in the neck. We had a
                    good friend who was our younger son's soccer coach who got caught in the waiting
                    area where there had been Marines but had been withdrawn, and she had to scurry
                    in under cover. There was more excitement than anybody wanted.</p>

                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: When we arrived, there was very little gasoline to be found. A guy on the
                    back of this truck on the road would be selling it. That's the only way you
                    could get it. Finally, the embassy would have a big truck come in, and the call
                    would be made in the morning, gasoline's going to be here, bring your cars in.
                    So, you'd have to go out and bring in your Gerry cans to be filled with
                    gasoline. There was one what we would call a supermarket run by the Finnish.
                    Many people would buy their produce and their meats from Stockman's Department
                    Store in Helsinki and have their purchases shipped to them. My wife would pay
                    the bill every month, and pretty soon, at some point they sent her a letter and
                    said look, you have excess amount in the account. What do you want to do with
                    this account? She said, well, just send me cheese. We got cheese. She had no
                    idea — this was going on without my knowledge, I confess — we got a shipment of
                    cheese that was close to 50 pounds, 50 pounds of cheese, and we had to give the
                    stuff away. We froze what we could and we put it in our freezer, and we'd have
                    to give it away. She was buying more and paying beyond what the bill was. So
                    we'd get eggs and milk and cheese and other things from Finland because it
                    wasn't available locally. Toward when we left, there were department stores open
                    and a few good restaurants. McDonald's was there, but there were no other
                    western style restaurants in town when we arrived. When we left, there were
                    several, and now I understand you don't lack for anything in Moscow for food or
                    anything. It's come a long way. I have a lot of hope for Russia. Russian people
                    are wonderful, wonderful people. I have a lot of respect for the suffering that
                    they have done over the years and the ability to muddle through, to hang on
                    desperately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: You're absolutely right. My wife's an artist, and we have a picture on
                    our living room wall that she painted from a photo that I took an hour from
                    Moscow. I'm not going to remember the village we passed through where, one hour
                    from Moscow, where a woman in a town of, I would guess 50,000, she was drawing
                    water from a well. Downtown. They had no indoor plumbing. Drawing water from a
                    well. We know for a fact telephones in these towns were not very common. You get
                    a call a guy that runs a little store, and the owner sends someone down to your
                    house to tell you you got a call. Yet we visited military facilities, a military
                    museum in one case, where they had the Sputniks and military technology of this
                    kind and the other that was every bit as good as ours, on the military side. The
                    people may not have had shoes, but they had a first class military
                    establishment. First class. And a first class space program.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: Ottawa was a wonderful respite after Moscow. After Russia. We bought a
                    house there out in the rural area, two and a half acres. My son went to public
                    school for the first two years there. There was a very good church which we
                    joined and became very good friends with a lot of the people there. I played
                    golf with a man in the church who had invited us out for first time we were
                    there. He now lives in New Jersey, works for Nestl�'s in New Jersey. We played
                    golf regularly. We still have very close friends in Canada. We were up there
                    last Memorial day when I gave a speech on trade issues. A wonderful place. Jim
                    Blanchard was the ambassador when we arrived. Former governor of Michigan and
                    House of Representatives. Good man. Did some good things. He and I got along
                    very well. He and his DCM, Jim Walsh. We had a very good experience there. After
                    Blanchard came, Giffin, an attorney from Atlanta who was the chairman of the
                    Clinton-Gore Committee in Georgia. Nowhere near as effective as Blanchard was.
                    Well over his head in my view on what to do and how to do it. We got along,
                    however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: For Canada it really was the issue of NAFTA. NAFTA had been implemented
                    in January of '94. We had had a Canada Free Trade Agreement since '89, but
                    Mexico came into the picture and negotiated with the other two NAFTA members,
                    Canada and the U.S., and NAFTA was created. As I did in Toronto in the late
                    '80's after the Canada Tree Trade Agreement was implemented, I spent a lot of
                    time speaking in the United States on the issue of why U.S. firms ought to be
                    doing business in Canada. I did it with the financing of a freight forwarding
                    firms who paid the bill and with the cooperation of Canada Customs. A
                    representative of Canada Customs and a freight forwarder and I were a threesome,
                    and we went to 50 U.S. cities, maybe more, and my staff did another 50 or more
                    seminars in Indianapolis, in Dallas and in Minneapolis, Seattle, etc. on why
                    U.S. firms ought to be looking at Canada. In fact, we called it The Canada First
                    Program. We developed a brochure, did some marketing and it became very
                    successful. Our idea was that if you haven't exported before, Think Canada
                    First. Then when I went to Mexico everyone said well, I suppose you're going to
                    change it and have Think Mexico First. We had an interesting time.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that cropped up promoting this. Were
                        there any particular issues that came up as being Canada and American
                        trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: One issue that we dealt with was called the Rules of Origin. When you
                    have a Free Trade Agreement with another country, you have to determine what
                    goods qualify and what goods don't. If you have a Czech product coming into
                    Canada and it's merely transferred from Canada to the United States, that's not
                    a Canadian product, so it shouldn't qualify. A very serious, a very complicated
                    series of rules were designed product by product, tariff number by tariff
                    number, on what products qualify, under what conditions these products should be
                    given the preferential treatment within the Free Trade Agreement. There were
                    serious penalties if you shipped a good, claim NAFTA status, and it doesn't
                    qualify for it. So, firms have to keep records of what kind of inputs they have
                    into the final product that's shipped. They have to keep documents on the value
                    and, in some cases, from where goods came. For instance, if you put together a
                    suit made from material from the United States, it qualifies even though the
                    final assembly is in Canada. The apparel manufacture would have to keep track of
                    the cost of the zippers and the buttons and the fabric and all this and where it
                    comes from. Very complicated rules, but we spent a lot of time helping firms
                    understand those rules to avoid the penalties which were serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an appeals process that you often stood by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: One of the benefits of NAFTA was the establishment of, if you want to
                    call it, an appeals court where you didn't have to get attorneys and the local
                    courts involved either in Canada or the United States. There were NAFTA panels
                    set up. If I remember the rules correctly, five member panels in some, maybe
                    three in others. If there are five members, two from each country and they would
                    alternate among the panels who gets the third member. They'd study the case and
                    determine whether the laws of the country, whether the Commerce Department, for
                    instance, and the International Trade Commission, in a dumping case or a subsidy
                    case followed its own rules, and whether the assessments, judgments, made by
                    those two parties were fair. We got overturned on some, we won some, but the
                    process was in a sense a way to channel all this anger and furor into a
                    quasi-judicial effort that took the heat out of a lot of the bilateral
                    relationship. We have more than a billion dollars a day traded between our two
                    countries, every day, 365 days a year. Most of that trade, 98% of it, goes
                    without a problem. It's only the few cases, softwood lumber and now we've got
                    cattle issues and occasionally a car issue, car parts, raise problems. By and
                    large, it's a fairly good trade relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: The Canadian federal government, which had opposed initially this
                    agreement with us when it was in opposition, was now very supportive. They had
                    campaigned on a promise to study the whole thing and maybe turn it around. They
                    realized very quickly that this was in Canada's benefit, this was to Canada's
                    benefit, and had been that way. It's not an issue in Canada any longer. NAFTA
                    has been a success for the United States and for Canada. One could argue it's
                    been more of a success for Canada. It had its deal with the United States. They
                    didn't need to do anything. Maybe there were some ways the Canada-U.S. Free
                    Trade could be improved. They didn't like some of the dispute settlement
                    procedures that had been agreed to, but they didn't want initially to join
                    Mexico in this relationship. They did eventually because they feared that the
                    United States would become, if you will, the hub of investment decisions in
                    North America. Firms that wanted to enter into relationships, business
                    relationships, in North American, could only go to the United States if they
                    wanted to trade with both countries, because United States had an agreement with
                    Mexico, and the United States had an agreement with Canada. If Toyota, for
                    instance, wanted to put in a new car plant, where would it go if you wanted to
                    sell both to Mexico and Canada? There was only one place it could go — the
                    United States. Canada and Mexico would become spokes in this wheel with the
                    United States as the hub, and they were right fearing that. Toyota just made a
                    recent decision not to go to Alabama, but to go to Ontario, and that would not
                    have happened had it not been for NAFTA because NAFTA gives Toyota the rights to
                    sell into the United States so long as they meet the Rules of Origin just as if
                    they were making cars in Alabama.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Canadians are very sensitive to their cultural industries. The folks that
                    were the loudest opponents to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement initially
                    back in the late '80's were the intellectual elites: the professors and the
                    journalists, the elite media, very concerned that they would be overrun by
                    American culture. I find this so interesting because there are so many
                    Canadians: Morley Safer and Peter Jennings and a half a dozen comedians are all
                    Canadian. You'll never hear a peep from us about the infiltration of Canadians
                    into our culture here, but boy, was it an issue in Canada!</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: I'd like to say yes, but I don't think so. There will always be under the
                    surface for many Canadians a little tension with respect to us. We're the big
                    boy next door. They're always a little more sensitive about what we do and how
                    we do it because it might draw them into something that they don't want to be
                    drawn into. They are very careful to promote multi-nationalism. They're big on
                    international organizations to, if you will, thwart the overbearing United
                    States in the bi-lateral relationship with them. They're very big in the United
                    Nations, very big in other international organizations. They joined the OAS in
                    the '90's to play a role there. They hadn't been a player before. We might feel
                    that way with the tables turned.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Helms-Burton. That would somehow punish Canadian businesses that did
                    business with Cuba, particularly in areas where our properties had been
                    expropriated. For instance, an American company owned a hotel there, it's later
                    taken over by Canadians, and they're doing business with our property in a
                    sense, with U.S. private sector property. There was a case once where the son or
                    daughter of an owner of one of these properties in Cuba was a Princeton student
                    or was planning to attend Princeton. What was the embassy going to do? What
                    advice were they going to give the Department on how to handle this? I frankly
                    don't know how this was resolved, so I...in the end, but I know it was an issue,
                    a sensitive one, because the businessman was clearly someone that needed to be
                    handled delicately. I know it was an issue. Canadians are big investors in Cuba
                    today, remains so, primarily in the hotel business there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: In '99, I was all set to go to London. I thought that was where my
                    assignment was to be, my last assignment. I was then a career minister, and
                    there was only one other career minister, and he was already on assignment. We
                    only had two. But I had such strong credentials for Mexico, unfortunately, and
                    Mexico was on my bid list, last, but it was on my list. I lived in Mexico, I was
                    the Mexican Office Director in the Department in the early '80's, and I knew
                    NAFTA issues which was now Mexico. We had some problems with our operation
                    there, and they said Dale, I'm sorry, we have to send you to Mexico, so that's
                    where I ended up. I was disappointed at first, but I had a very good tour there.
                    It was a very interesting challenge in Mexico. We drove there and back and forth
                    all the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I came back to Washington, spent a year as a Diplomat in Resident at
                    George Mason University teaching and then spent two months in the department
                    doing a project, and then I retired at the end of the year.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: In Mexico, we're not in the Chancery. We had our own building, a large
                    building which has a trade center. Offices on the second floor. The idea of the
                    trade center when it was built in '82 was to provide a place for U.S. firms to
                    come exhibit their products to sell to Mexicans, and be in a setting that we
                    control: language, entry of the goods, etc. It was a good idea in '82. But by
                    the late '90's the Mexicans had built these enormous trade centers around,
                    exhibition halls, first class, world class facilities, and more were being
                    built. By 2000 there had been an earthquake in Mexico, and a lot of buildings
                    around our facility in downtown Mexico were damaged. It was kind of a marginal
                    area for an exhibition center</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And traffic, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: There was no place to park. Also, there were I would call them,
                    businesses of ill repute not far away, and the demand for our facility was
                    falling. What to do with a big staff that ran this facility and the facility
                    itself? So the first year I was there, we lost $500,000 on this thing, and I saw
                    no end to it. So I said, we have to close this place down, fire these people.
                    Not fire them, but let them go. We had people there that had been thirty years
                    working the Trade Center. They hadn't done anything else for a career. It cost
                    us mega bucks, but we did it well. We worked very closely with the Embassy's
                    personnel people to follow the legal steps required under Mexican law to give
                    notice, to help them find new positions if they wanted them, and we closed that
                    location down. We moved USIS, which had a facility behind our building in a
                    building that every time there was an earthquake, they wondered whether it was
                    going to stand up. It needed mega bucks to keep standing. So we moved them into
                    our facility. It saved the USG a ton of money, got us out of a business we
                    didn't need to be in any longer. There were plenty of other trade show
                    facilities around of town. It was very hard on the staff, however. We lost, I
                    think, twenty people. Some left bitter and mad that we had to do this. We took
                    as many as we thought we could justify — the good ones that we thought we could
                    retrain into different functions. It was a very interesting management play, and
                    I got a lot of satisfaction out of doing it and doing it well.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: Very good. Canada sends 90% of their exports to the United States,
                    probably 90% plus now. Mexico approaches that now, too. They are very highly
                    dependent on the U.S. economy which can be risky for both countries, but they
                    are. A lot of U.S. firms have operations there. We found, for example, in the
                    textile area, that U.S. firms in North Carolina shut down their operations that
                    required a lot of hand labor to sew garments together and moved those to Mexico.
                    But that increased 5-, 6-, 10-fold the amount of material — textile fabric —
                    that they would produce to send to Mexico for the final assembly operation. It
                    was a very strange phenomena where half the textile industry, the apparel
                    industry, was supportive of us, and half wasn't. If they were integrated, then
                    they generally supported us. If they were just in the final assembly operation,
                    then they were against it. Very interesting. That process continues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Mexican both business
                        operations and the manufacturing operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Very, very sophisticated. I seldom left a plant where I didn't leave
                    impressed at the quality of what was being done and the quality of management.
                    Ford has an assembly operation in the northern city of Hermosillo, the state of
                    Sonora. That plant is now the model plant for Ford around the world. They bring
                    in management and labor teams from their operations around the world to see how
                    it's done in Hermosillo because it's done so well there. Chrysler opened an
                    engineering center in Toluca, south of Mexico City, not just for the plant there
                    but for their Brazilian operations, and their European operations. You have
                    engineers - they were going to hire up to a thousand of them, I don't know if
                    they did that or not - a thousand new engineers designing Chrysler products
                    worldwide. Mexico is not the sleepy agricultural based society that you and I
                    perhaps have in our mind. It's still a country that has some issues to deal
                    with, but it's come a long way, and NAFTA's helped. NAFTA's helped, indeed!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the new government under Fox. Did this break
                        up the old pre-monopoly and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: That was a great time to be in Mexico because the election occurred then,
                    and the 80 years, a little bit less, of PRI domination in the politics of the
                    country came to an end. Unfortunately, the expectations of Mr. Fox and his new
                    team were so high that there were few of us in the Embassy that thought he'd be
                    able to deliver anywhere near what the Mexican public expected, particularly
                    since the Congress was still PRI dominated, the PAN party, Fox's party, did not
                    have the majority there. And that's, in fact, the way it turned out. In fact, to
                    be frank, Fox has done very little of the things that had to be done for the
                    economy there. A major restructuring of the electrical distribution system and
                    the generation of electricity is urgently needed. Brown-outs there at any time,
                    in my view, could cripple industry. What industry has done, if they were large
                    enough, they have created their own co-generation plants and then sold off extra
                    to others in the area, just to be sure they'd have it, because they saw it
                    coming, too. Pemex, the big oil facility there, is not doing anywhere near the
                    kind of investment into the plant and exploration that needs to be done.</p>
                <p>I don't know about corruption, but the dominance of the union is still an issue.
                    It happens in the electricity sector, too. The ministry that runs the
                    electricity distribution system is...it's not to the same extent, but it's like
                    the railroad industry in the United States when they turned from the coal-fired
                    to the electric locomotives, and the union demanded that the coal shovelers
                    should be still on the trains. That's what's going on, at least in part of
                    Mexico. Education helped. They're working on these issues, but Fox was never
                    able to use his early popularity to the degree we all hoped he could have to
                    change some of these basic structural issues in the Mexican economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your observation? How much of this economic worth
                        penetrated into the villages? You think of the Indian villages that supplied
                        a lot of the stoop labor in the United States. Was it making inroads?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: I suppose that you could argue that health and education improved, and
                    probably statistics would show that's the case. But still, the migration roots
                    in Mexico is still from the country into the city or from the country directly
                    into the United States. There's not much left in rural Mexican towns. Our
                    agricultural products now can come into Mexico. I guess in 2008 the final
                    tariffs are going to be lifted for some of the most sensitive products, but a
                    lot of our products are coming in now into Mexico. Corn. Mexico imports corn
                    from the United States. It's remarkable. This has hurt the small farmers who
                    essentially were hand-to-mouth and needed to be subsidized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about corruption? One always hears about the police
                        and all this. How did American manufacturers find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: It continues to be a problem, most sensitive in the war on drugs. You
                    read every couple of months about some chief of police in a border town or
                    somewhere in Mexico being on the take. Many of his staff as well. There were
                    three containers of blue jeans that came out of a U.S. subsidiary southeast of
                    Mexico City in 2000, heading to the United States, and the trucks were hijacked.
                    In the final analysis, the perpetrators were police who knew the routes, knew
                    what to do, and had people to sell these goods to. Is it better? Probably it's
                    better than what it was. I have an older brother that loves to travel but
                    refuses to go to Mexico because if he were ever stopped on the road, he feared
                    the police would be more of a hindrance than a help. He visited us in Mexico. He
                    rented a car and went all around, had no problems. He left with a different
                    sense which was good. It is an issue, however. It is endemic in the society.
                    These people are underpaid and view the only way out of their situation is to
                    take a bite out of someone else. Mordida they call it. It will take years for
                    that to leave.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Oh, yes. Mexican middle class, upper middle class, grew by leaps and
                    bounds as investments were made in the Mexican economy by U.S. and Mexicans
                    themselves. One of the problems with Mexico was that so much of the Mexican
                    money was going to the United States and not being invested in Mexico. NAFTA
                    took care of a lot of that, gave them a sense that they could invest confidently
                    in their own country. Stability of the currency, the peso, and stability in the
                    governmental structure helped.</p>

                    but didn't have anything to do with the fact that I was in Mexico, but it's
                    important to put it on the record here.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>At the very end of l999, at the very end of the Clinton administration, after
                    considerable pressure by a gay and lesbian group among the State Department
                    Foreign Service Officers. The State Department agreed to a series of changes to
                    their policy that, in a sense, provided benefits to the gay partners of Foreign
                    Service Officers when abroad. I found this objectionable. I thought this was in
                    my view the camel's head underneath the tent, and pretty soon the whole camel
                    would be there. I didn't think that was appropriate. My reading of the New
                    Testament and the Old Testament tells me unequivocally that this is not proper
                    behavior. I thought it would be injurious to the institution of marriage. I
                    thought it would sully the image of the United States abroad if we provided
                    benefits to gay officers abroad in a sense making them appear that a marriage
                    with a person of the same sex was fine with us as a government. I wrote an
                    article to the State Department magazine the Foreign Service Journal an article
                    in their “Speaking Out” section laying out my views based on my religious
                    understanding as well as other arguments. I wrote it early in the year, and then
                    went back and forth quite a while with my draft with the journal's editors.
                    Finally they said okay, we're going to carry this, and they carried it in the
                    September 2001 issue. In the meantime, and without my knowledge, they gave my
                    article to GLIFA, Gay and Lesbian Officers in the Foreign Affairs agencies
                    organization in the State Department and asked them to review it and prepare a
                    separate rejoinder that would adjoin mine. They didn't tell me anything about
                    this or give me an opportunity to reply to the GLIFA piece which I thought was
                    somewhat tawdry on their part. Two pieces appeared. I got a lot of support, and
                    I got a lot of grief for this public expression. Very interesting. State
                    Department people from London to Australia sent me E-mails saying this needed to
                    be said, I'm glad you said it. I got others calling me homophobe and hope my
                    children would become gay and this, that and the other. Why raise it now? It's
                    because my Director General Maria Cino, a political appointee approached me,
                    told her senior staff as a consequence of this letter, this open letter, they
                    would not forward my name as ambassador to the State Department the next time we
                    had an opening. I found this very objectionable. I viewed it as a violation of
                    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. I met with her in May in Williamsburg where
                    we had a conference for officers in the Western Hemisphere. I met with her
                    privately, and I told her of my concerns. She was taken aback a bit. “Well,” she
                    said, “these were only my private views to my staff, I didn't mean them to be
                    gotten back to you,” and this, that and the other. I said look, this is my
                    position. You will not — unless you want me to take legal action — you will not
                    prohibit my name to be sent up this year. It was a nasty issue and an unpleasant
                    way to end a career. I was very offended that management would do that, and I
                    was hurt, and I was bitter. My name did go up, but they changed the policy. It
                    used to be that only career ministers' names went up. Four of us went up that
                    year. I was the only career minister and two others. I guess it was one other
                    career minister and two others went up. I thought it was pretty sad. I thought I
                    did the right thing. I slept better at night knowing that I put my views out,
                    and maybe it stiffened the backbone of some others that felt that way, too.</p>

                    out early in the week with statistics on a survey done in Britain on what
                    percent of Muslims support terrorism. They would not turn terrorists in if they
                    thought that this was happening. They view what was going on was appropriate,
                    and he found this astounding. So, he went with the conclusion that Islam is a
                    terrorist religion. He went for two days with this. They took him off the air
                    yesterday. I don't know how long he'll be off or what he'll have to do to come

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SLAGHT: That was a very interesting time. I didn't want to come back and work in
                    headquarters given the atmosphere. I think I could have been Deputy Director,
                    but who wanted to work in an office with the director that I had there. I said I
                    didn't want to do that. Why be miserable in my last year of service? I only had
                    a year left on the time-in-class, TIC. In Commerce's system, career ministers
                    could only stay four years. I knew I was going out. There was no else for me to
                    go. Can't go above that. I thought I always wanted to teach. I had a PhD, so in
                    retirement maybe I'll teach. This was a good opportunity to find out if I really
                    wanted to do this. I asked headquarters if I found a place that would take me,
                    would you pay my salary? They said of course. They probably didn't want me there
                    either, truth be known. I wrote to several schools, and I got the most
                    enthusiastic response from George Mason. I agreed to teach out there. I taught
                    undergraduate level courses two semesters and one summer school program. I
                    taught the basic Introduction to International Relations course. I had 50
                    students in each class. Then I taught an upper level course on NAFTA and, of
                    course, a class on U.S.-Latin America relations which I found far more
                    satisfying. Turns out I should have taught graduate students. All my friends
                    told me that, but I wanted to impact student decisions and career paths. I
                    wanted to encourage them to go into international business or in government some
                    way and working with international or non-governmental organizations, working
                    with something international. I think I had a minor impact on that. I was
                    frustrated there. Most of the students there were part time and were more
                    interested in working to make the payments for their cars or new stereo systems
                    or whatever other material goods they were after at that time, than to do their
                    work. Of the 350 or so students that I taught, I guess there were maybe 10 that
                    I would count as serious students. That was a sad commentary for me to say. I
                    gave all the students in the International Relations intro course an
                    international awareness quiz my first day as much for me to gauge what they
                    knew. I had been out of the country for 18 years. I didn't know what students
                    knew. There were 50 questions. Only two students got 61%. That was the highest
                    grade of about 130 students. The highest grades were 61%. I had 50% of the
                    students taking the test get less than 10 answers correct. Twenty percent. Some
                    of the questions were easy: Who is our current Secretary of State? Where is the
                    headquarters of the United Nations? Some stretched a little bit the range of
                    knowledge, you'd expect. Who's our largest trading partner? What is the OAS?
                    What happened on August 6, 1945? Others were more difficult. Who is Robert
                    Mugabe, for example. I thought it was a fair test, but I was shocked at how
                    little American undergraduates knew of things international. I sent it to the
                    Post, my write-up of this international affairs quiz for their World Affairs
                    Week, but they didn't carry it.</p>

                <p>SLAGHT: The real people to address that question is the U.S. business community.
                    I think if you ask them, those that have had contact with us would be, by and
                    large, very supportive. They were unhappy with the State Department when the
                    State handled the commercial function. This was a low priority for most people
                    in the State. If you wanted to get ahead, you're not going to be in the
                    commercial section. You need to be in the political section or someplace else. I
                    think by and large in the 25 years that we've been existence, it's been a
                    success. I'm sure the American business community would say they're glad that it
                    was done, and continue to support our operations. The problem we have is with
                    administrations, both Republican and Democrat. We fight with OMB year after year
                    whether we need to be doing what we're doing. Why does the U.S. businessman need
                    support in Canada? Why does he need support in England? Why does he need support
                    in Australia? They could argue maybe in China we need you guys, but there's a
                    sense that the services we provide could be provided by the private sector and
                    why should we be in the business? Our budget compared to the budgets of our
                    major competitors is miniscule. Canada had a bigger budget on the trade side
                    than we dis, when I was in Ottawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some of these countries, this is what they do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Some 30-40% of Canada's GDP derives from exports. We're in the 10% range.
                    If only more firms would export, we'd be in a lot better shape. There's not the
                    political support for it. The Commercial Service also has a domestic operation.
                    We're an integrated operation where we have about 100 offices in the United
                    States, and when you try to close an office in Somerset, Kentucky, for instance,
                    the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, or used to be, would see that our
                    budget would be affected. We couldn't even contemplate that. Anytime you wanted
                    to close an office in any of these Congressional Districts, well, there was hell
                    to be paid. There's no constituency if you want to close Hong Kong or reduce the
                    staff in Belgium, so we have this budget problem continually.</p>

                        not overly supportive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: Yes. I can say that frankly, too. We fall into the International Trade
                    Administration, ITA, and they have policy wonks and they have other activities
                    that they support. We are a large component, but we're not a favored component
                    of that operation. Why do we pay all these monies for the staff over there? What
                    do they do for us? These questions were continually posed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you ever feel you are under pressure? I can see how
                        politics, being what they are, somebody saying you know, we've got somebody
                        who's living in Milan. Why don't we send my staff, my Chief of Staff from
                        the Foreign Commerce Committee, why don't we send him or her over
                        there?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>SLAGHT: You know it's been good in that regard. Apparently the system allows for
                    one of these people at any time. One went to Mexico in the late '80's. We've had
                    one, I want to say in Paris. There's only one position for patronage in our
                    system. If we have one now I'm unaware of it. It's not often used. In that
                    regard, we can't complain. It's not been used as a dumping ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This ends on a higher note. Dale, I thank you very
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SLAGHT: It's been my pleasure.</p>
