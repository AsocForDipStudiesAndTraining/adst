                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me first of all thank you for joining us in this
                        enterprise. It will be a valuable addition to the Oral History Program. As
                        is customary in these interviews, we start with a synopsis of your
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I was born in Chicago and went to grammar school there—a public school
                    called Martha Ruggles. I went through the first six grades there and then my
                    mother decided to spend a year in Greece. She was eager to have me learn Greek
                    and become fluent in it. Greece was the family point of origin. After a year, we
                    returned and I went through seventh and eighth grade at Ruggles. Then it was on
                    to Calumet High School on the south side of Chicago. Calumet had students in
                    those days from a large variety of south Chicago neighborhoods. The overflow
                    went to a branch, Westcot, for two years and that is where I started high
                    school. It was a smaller, more intimate atmosphere than the huge Calumet High
                    School. At Westcot, I had the opportunity to be active in intramural sports and
                    the school paper. It was a very congenial and friendly setting.</p>
                <p>After two years, I went to Calumet which was considerably further away and
                    required a time consuming commute. My two years at Calumet were blessed by an
                    extraordinarily good faculty, many of whom were graduates of the University of
                    Chicago. They were partial to that institution and whenever possible, pushed
                    their students to go that University, which I did. I graduated from Calumet in
                    June, 1940 and enrolled that Fall in the University of Chicago. I attended for
                    two and half years and then I entered the Army. Before starting at Chicago, I
                    had the notion that I would like to be involved in foreign affairs, in part
                    because one of those extraordinary teachers at Calumet was a student of modern
                    history. In the late 1930s, the Hitler-Mussolini pact was threatening the peace
                    in Europe; Germany and Italy were encroaching on other countries and territories
                    in Europe and Africa.</p>
                <p>We had in those days a great newspaper in Chicago, The Daily News, which I read
                    with great care even as young high school boy. The Daily News had a splendid
                    corps of foreign correspondents who were first hand observers and narrators of
                    events in Europe. They helped nurture the idea that I should one day be involved
                    in the government and specifically in foreign affairs. So there was a germ of
                    ambition even in my high school days.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I had an interesting career in the Army. The first phase took place at Camp
                    Wallace in Texas, which was an anti-aircraft personnel replacement training
                    camp. I ended up in the intelligence part of the anti-aircraft branch. I was
                    taught some basic aspects of surveillance, tracking, etc. But I also received
                    considerable training in basic infantry matters—drills, crawling, firing, etc.
                    The intelligence training was relatively primitive and very basic. Camp Wallace
                    was situated half way between Galveston and Houston. Whenever I could, I would
                    go to Houston which had a very good recreation area—for example, an art museum
                    that held afternoon concerts. Houston was my refuge from the Camp Wallace
                    routine, which I endured for six months.</p>
                <p>By the time I graduated from Camp Wallace, the need for anti-aircraft officers
                    had diminished sharply when I applied for Officers Candidate School. The quota
                    for anti-aircraft candidates from Camp Wallace was one out of about 20,000 men.
                    As it turned out, I was the first alternate to the one man (a cadre sergeant)
                    who had been chosen for OCS and therefore did not end up going. I was really
                    devastated by this turn of events. For by applying for OCS I had passed up a
                    chance to go to Army Specialist Training Program (ASTP), which was a great
                    opportunity to broaden one's background in the Army. ASTP often included
                    language and area training; some of my friends went into Japanese language
                    training, some studied European languages. I was very interested in that, but
                    having applied to OCS, even if unsuccessfully, ASTP passed me by. I was then at
                    the lowest rung of the military hierarchy—not even part of a unit. I was a
                    private available to assignment to any unit. The small group of us in this
                    status were sent to Fort Meade, outside of Baltimore. Half of our group went to
                    Iceland; the other half, including me, ended up in Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So in the Fall of 1943, I spent about six weeks doing various odds and ends at
                    Fort Meade. Then I was transferred as a replacement for some unit in Europe.
                    None of us knew where we would actually end up, because all of this information
                    was classified. We boarded the Queen Mary; because of the ship's speed and her
                    capability to move in a zig-zag course she went alone without a convoy. We made
                    it safely across the Atlantic to some unknown port in about five or six days—a
                    horrendous journey because the ship was jammed to capacity. At noon, a loud gong
                    boomed and we would troop from the deck to our six-tiered bunk rooms where we
                    were each given a color designating the day's meal setting. On the next day, we
                    rotated from bunks to sleep on the deck, which was pretty damn cold. We landed
                    at some indeterminate foreign port in the rain and were herded together under
                    the watch of a very disconsolate looking native. My companions urged me to speak
                    to this fellow. I went up to him and asked where we were. He responded in a
                    thick Scottish accent, which may have been a form of Gaelic. When I returned to
                    my colleagues uninformed, I told them that I couldn't understand the fellow who
                    spoke some kind of foreign language. It was quite a while before we learned that
                    we had landed at Grennock, Scotland. In an unusually efficient manner, we were
                    put on trains and spent the night traveling in blackout conditions through the
                    countryside to arrive at what had once been a housing estate outside of
                    Birmingham. It was a miserable day—cold, rainy, muddy. The conditions were very
                    primitive. We stayed there for a while; within a week or so, we were assigned to
                    our permanent units. My slip said that I was going to COSSAC. No one knew what
                    or where COSSAC was. My friends thought it was a commando unit working in
                    combined operations. I had all of four months of infantry training; it was
                    hardly sufficient for a commando operation, but I was resigned to go wherever
                    the fates would take me. Three or four of us were going to the same place. We
                    were put on a train and arrived late at night in London. We were met by two huge
                    MPs who asked where we were going. I said: “COSSAC”. They said: “Shhh! That is
                    Top Secret”. We were assigned to some kind of barracks and the next morning
                    taken to COSSAC (Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Command). This was the precursor
                    to Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters. COSSAC was a headquarters being put
                    together in anticipation of Eisenhower's arrival. When that happened, the name
                    was changed to Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF). I was
                    assigned to the intelligence section, which was a combined British-American
                    unit. I spent a year in London working under a glass skylight on the top floor
                    of the Peter Robinson Department store which was on Oxford Street adjoining
                    Oxford Circle. We were the center of intelligence collection and analyses prior
                    to the invasion.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>It was an extraordinary outfit. It was headed by an American, General George
                    Strong, later head of G-2. His British deputy and all of the staff were first
                    class. The British were mostly distinguished academics from Oxford and
                    Cambridge. Eventually, the section was split between those who were looking at
                    how the Germans were deployed and how they were being reinforced—the order of
                    battle—, and those who looked at various defenses; i.e underwater obstacles and
                    beach fortifications that the Germans had built all along the French, Belgian,
                    and Dutch coast lines. I ended up in the latter unit. My immediate supervisor
                    was an American—a Captain. He reported to a British Major, Beatty, who was a
                    classical scholar from Oxford. Most of us were enlisted men—privates or
                    non-commissioned officers. Most of the Americans had been trained at Camp
                    Richey, which was the main intelligence training center for the U.S. Thus, most
                    of my colleagues had some intelligence training. I had none. So my first
                    assignments were fairly menial—being in charge of maps, doing some filing, etc.
                    But soon I became involved in the real operations and any distinction that there
                    may have been because of lack of prior training disappeared.</p>
                <p>As I said, the group was extremely interesting. In fact, many of the Americans
                    were foreign born recruited because of their language skills. There was a French
                    count, a Russian ballet dancer, a curator of an art museum in San Francisco, an
                    export-import man from New York. Though of not much use, I had Greek as a second
                    language, thanks to my year in Greece. I also had some meager knowledge of
                    French. I had studied Latin in high school and had some tutoring in ancient
                    Greek, but no foreign languages in college. It was a great group to work with.
                    The head of the group working on the “Order of Battle” was J. L. Austin, who was
                    one of England's most distinguished philosophers. He was then a Lieutenant
                    Colonel. He had an extraordinarily retentive memory; he was alleged to know how
                    many German soldiers were in every fox hole along the coast and from unit they
                    derived.</p>
                <p>After a year at Peter Robinsons, we moved out to Bushey Park which was about ten
                    miles west of London near Kingston-on-Thames. I should note that during my year
                    in London, we were subjected to periodic blitz attacks, somewhat smaller than
                    they had been six months prior to my arrival. Our London barracks were extremely
                    poorly constructed; they were crumbling old British Army quarters off Regent's
                    Park. I would walk from there to Peter Robinson and back. At night, we had a
                    complete black-out and frequently, of course, actual air raids. In retrospect,
                    it was an exciting and enthralling period, but while actually living through it,
                    with all the tensions and sameness of food day after day, I don't think I had
                    the same view. After we moved out to Bushey Park, the V-1 missiles began to come
                    our way. We had a number of close calls. One part of the SHAEF compound was hit
                    as was the town of Kingston-on-Thames. It was very eerie to hear those missiles
                    approach and suddenly there would be dead silence, then when they came close
                    enough you would hear their descent and then a great explosion nearby.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I should mention that during my days in London, I met a young lady who was very
                    hospitable and brought me home to her Scot family. Her brother was an officer in
                    the Black Watch Regiment. So I had close ties to a British family which was a
                    great refuge; they permitted me to stay with them whenever I came into the city
                    from Bushey Park. Through this young lady, I met other interesting people. So
                    London was not then a bad place at all, even though the deadlier V-2 missiles
                    came in rather too often for comfort.</p>
                <p>The Red Cross did a fabulous job. It took over some of the great houses in London
                    where it established libraries, areas for snacking coffee and doughnuts and
                    places in which to relax. The Red Cross ladies were always very helpful and
                    friendly.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after the invasion of the Continent, I went to France. The shooting
                    had ceased. We traveled in trucks through the devastated Normandy country-side
                    to Versailles, outside of Paris, where we were housed in the King's small
                    stables. They had been made into large barracks, with several long rows of
                    beds—not a very comfortable setting. I tried to stay out of the stables as much
                    as I could. I went there late at night and would leave early in the morning; the
                    stench was just over-powering. Our offices were in some of the adjacent
                    buildings of the Palace. We mapped the German defenses as they moved back, or in
                    some cases, forward. My specialty was German anti-aircraft emplacements which,
                    as the war progressed, also became locations for anti-infantry cannon fire. That
                    was particularly true of 88 mm guns which could be readily used both against
                    aircraft and troops. Our information came from a variety of sources: aerial
                    photographs that were very good—which were read by our photo interpreters—,
                    reports from agents on the ground—mostly French resistance fighters. Some of
                    those were excellent. I remember having a great deal of respect for the reports
                    from “Matilda” whoever she or he may have been. I would plot sightings of
                    anti-aircraft emplacements on a map; that map was then photographed, reproduced
                    and disseminated to the various Army group commands. It was tedious work.</p>
                <p>I think my myopia developed there because I worked under one light bulb hung from
                    the ceiling. I worked long hours, marking those maps.</p>
                <p>One exciting moment occurred after the Battle of the Bulge when the decision was
                    made that a lot of us “desk” soldiers should be mobilized and ordered to the
                    front. I was interviewed and offered a commission to become part of a fighting
                    unit. I accepted, but in the end it was found not to be necessary. Again I
                    missed the commission to my chagrin, although by this time I had moved up to
                    corporal or sergeant. I felt very aggrieved because many of my friends had gone
                    to O.C.S. and became officers, and here I was still an enlisted man.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Paris was an interesting attraction to have nearby. Every opportunity I had, I
                    went to the city. Paris was bleak in those days; food was short, the atmosphere
                    was cold and grim, but it was still Paris. I could hear classical music and
                    visit art galleries. From Versailles, just before VE Day, we moved to Frankfurt;
                    some had earlier gone with Eisenhower to Rheims to forward headquarters; my
                    group, in a middle echelon, stayed put.</p>
                <p>Just a comment about SHAEF. I doubt that in any modern war there has been as
                    intimate a relationship between two armed forces as there was in SHAEF. A
                    British-American hierarchy was established throughout the whole headquarters,
                    which included G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5 (a civil government unit founded in
                    preparation for the occupation of enemy territory). Anybody who felt antipathy
                    toward the British or who spoke with any strong bias was fired, i.e. transferred
                    out. We did have one or two incidents during which there were some altercations.
                    The combatants were quickly sent somewhere else. No open prejudices were
                    tolerated. The headquarters was a very amiable place and a very successful
                    venture. I could not praise enough the British officers at SHAEF who were a very
                    able and distinguished group.</p>
                <p>Our lived and worked in Hoechst am Main, a suburb of Frankfurt. It was there that
                    we heard of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that V-J Day
                    occurred. I remember the impact of those events very well. After a few months we
                    were moved to Berlin where we became part of the intelligence branch of AMGUS
                    (American Military Government, United States). By that time, most of our
                    responsibilities were finished. We did a lot of collating of German documents;
                    we sorted out library materials. It was an interim job, which was not very
                    interesting. The Military Government had begun to expand and a number of us were
                    offered civilian positions with that unit. By that time, I had achieved the
                    exalted rank of staff sergeant and I was offered a very attractive civilian job.
                    Some of my friends, including a former Belgian poet, stayed on as civilians in
                    AMGUS. I didn't want any part of it. As a matter of fact, I was sick and tired
                    of the Army and anxious to leave it and return to the University of Chicago to
                    get my degree. So in early 1946, I turned down all offers. I had been overseas
                    since October 1943 and had accumulated a fair number of points toward
                    demobilization and, therefore, within six months of my arrival in Berlin, I was
                    sent to Bremerhaven where I boarded a small ship and returned to the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>An aunt and uncle of mine had taken a house in Clearwater, Florida, and invited
                    me down. So after my discharge at Fort Sheridan (outside of Chicago), I went
                    South and stayed with them for a couple of weeks. Then I returned for the spring
                    quarter at the University of Chicago. I got my bachelor's degree in 1947 and
                    then went on to Graduate School in Political Science, where I took an MA in
                    1948. Those were heady days; we had an extraordinary group of students—veterans
                    mostly who had had exciting and remarkable experiences. They were mature and
                    very desirous to move on and to try to make up for lost time. It was the most
                    intellectually exciting period of my life. It was a great formative period. The
                    College faculty included such luminaries as Dan Bell, David Reisman, Milton
                    Singer (a great South-Asia scholar)—people of extraordinary ability who were
                    first-rate teachers. Since they were close to us in age, we came to know them
                    very well. One of my professors, Edward Shils, had a joint appointment to
                    Chicago and the London School of Economics at the University of London. He
                    thought that it would be useful for me to spend a year abroad, and suggested the
                    London School of Economics, which at the time was considered an intellectual
                    mecca. He thought it would be a useful experience to be exposed to another
                    culture and society. And that is what I did.</p>
                <p>So in the Fall of 1948, I went to London and became a graduate student at the
                    School of Economics. I had not excluded government as a career, but by this time
                    I thought I was heading for academia. The post-war Chicago period had greatly
                    inclined me towards academic pursuits. I think I was considering an academic
                    career, although undoubtedly government remained a fall back position. One of my
                    former Chicago professors, Leonard White, a professor of public administration,
                    had once suggested my name to a friend of his who was responsible for staffing
                    the Marshall Plan missions overseas. My dissertation concerned “The Permanent
                    Structure of the Conservative Party”. I had decided the Conservative Party had a
                    much longer period of gestation than the Labor Party and therefore had a much
                    more stable, formal Party apparatus, as distinguished from the Parliamentary
                    party delegation. My mentors thought this an interesting subject. So I started
                    doing research on how the Conservative party had evolved into its modern
                    form.</p>
                <p>During the year, we had a weekly graduate student tea, which various speakers
                    addressed. One of our classmates was the daughter of a Mr. “Skinny” Holmgren, an
                    official of the Marshall Plan. He had just been transferred from Greece to
                    London where he was part of the Marshall Plan team. His daughter had asked him
                    to come to give a talk at the tea. I met Holmgren there; we chatted and he
                    kindly invited my wife and myself to join him for dinner. He talked to me about
                    the extraordinary initiative that the U.S. was taking in Greece. He gave me a
                    real sense of what was going on and what needed to be done. I mentioned that I
                    spoke Greek. He said that the Marshall Plan Mission in Athens could really use
                    someone like me. He wanted to know if I would be interested. I said: “Of
                    course!”. He said he would communicate with some of his friends in the mission
                    in Athens and suggested that during the next break at the School of Economics, I
                    go to Athens to talk to them. And that is what I did. I went by train through
                    France and Italy and flew from Rome to Athens. I was received very warmly.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The head of the mission was John Nuveen, a Chicago financier and founder of the
                    family of municipal bonds funds that now bear his name. He was then on the Board
                    of the University of Chicago. The fact that I was a graduate of that institution
                    undoubtedly endeared me to him. The other members of the staff whom I met were
                    also very encouraging and decided that I should be assigned to the Civil
                    Government Division which was engaged in assisting to reorganize the Greek
                    government. The Marshall Plan mission had only been opened for a relatively
                    short time, although the Truman Doctrine had been enunciated while I was still
                    at the University of Chicago. U.S. involvement in Greece and Turkey came about,
                    partially at least, because the British had come to the conclusion after the war
                    that they could not maintain responsibility or even a major presence in Greece.
                    They in fact turned the eastern Mediterranean over to the United States.</p>
                <p>Soon after British withdrawal, there had been established an American Mission for
                    Aid to Greece (AMAG). That was later incorporated into the Marshall Plan, which
                    was announced in 1948. When I visited Athens in late 1949, the mission was
                    perhaps a year old. One of the sections of the mission, called the “Civil
                    Government Division” was staffed with public administration experts. The section
                    then had five professionals and I became the sixth member and, of course, the
                    most junior. This staff was involved in helping the newly formed Greek
                    government, which was just rising out of the civil war, to reform and streamline
                    itself. This kind of assistance was brand new to Americans; we had never been
                    called upon before to provide technical assistance, particularly in the field of
                    public administration. One of the professionals was helping the Greeks establish
                    a civil service commission, including employment criteria, promotion schemes,
                    etc. His name was Ford Luikhart, who had been a member of the U.S. Civil Service
                    Commission. (Manny DeAngelis, whom you know, was elsewhere in the mission as a
                    member of the administrative staff). Russ Drake, John Walker, John Russell were
                    the others in my Division. These were all people who had acquired extensive
                    managerial and administrative experience in the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>We also had Greek employees, some of whom were professionals. I had an assistant
                    who helped me as translator when my Greek did not convey the full sense of my
                    remarks. The “Civil Government” Division was fairly well established when I
                    reported for duty. It added one more American employee later when we needed an
                    expert on local government. That was Professor Harold Alderfer from Penn State
                    University. Our big effort was to decentralize the government. Historically, it
                    had been highly centralized based on the French model. The Greeks used the
                    French system of regional prefects or governors (”Nomarchs” in Greek) appointed
                    by Athens. We wanted to give the Nomarchs greater independence from the center.
                    To show you the extent of that centralization, I well remember the story that,
                    before we got involved in Greek administration, a local school could not even
                    replace a window without permission from the Ministry of Education. Greek
                    centralization was ridiculous. So we put great stress on decentralization and
                    Alderfer was instrumental in developing a new code for local government.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The “Civil Government” Division helped the existing Greek government to develop a
                    new organizational scheme. We helped to determine the number of new ministries,
                    their functions, and activities and so on, but in looking back, while our
                    efforts were useful in discrete areas such as the reorganization of the civil
                    service, including a new commission and new laws and regulations and the
                    codification of local government, there were no fundamental shifts. It was not
                    the sort of “starting from scratch” that we brought about in Japan, partly
                    because in Greece we did not have a military government as MacArthur did. Many
                    of us felt that the U. S. government, given the Marshall Plan's enormous
                    resources and the U.S. influence it generated, could have done much more to
                    shape and mold reform. We did not take full advantage of our extraordinary
                    influence and when we did apply pressure, the Greeks were very skillful at
                    evading and modifying our suggestions and recommendations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder whether you could expand a little on the Greek
                        attitude towards the Civil Government Division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: For one thing, change is difficult. We were proposing ideas that would
                    shake up existing practices and hierarchies—the norms with which the civil
                    servants were familiar. What the Marshall Plan group found was a government that
                    had emerged from a difficult war and a severe occupation—first by the Italians
                    and then the Germans. There had been great food shortages causing many deaths.
                    Immediately after the departure of the Germans, a major communist onslaught took
                    place in an effort to take over the government. That was forestalled by the
                    British through Winston Churchill's strong actions and views. By the time we
                    replaced the British, the attempted take-over of the government had been
                    stymied, but the communists took to the northern mountains from where they
                    conducted a raging civil war for several years.</p>
                <p>During the AMAG period and into the first year of the Marshall Plan that replaced
                    it, there was a war going on which called for a significant U.S. input. We gave
                    considerable military assistance and supplied many advisors. General Van Fleet
                    who later became well known in Korea, was the head of the U.S. military mission.
                    He was highly influential in shaping the tactics and the training of the Greek
                    army for fighting the communists in the mountains.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>By the time I arrived, the Greek government was just emerging victorious from the
                    civil war. It had pretty much abated and was rapidly coming to an end in October
                    1949 when I joined the Mission. We were able to carry on with very modest
                    constraints although small pockets of resistance still remained in the north.
                    The Greek government that was elected faced deep-seated rivalries between the
                    old Republican and the Monarchist factions. In the late 1940s, Greece was still
                    a monarchy. The conservative pro-monarchy faction of the Greek political
                    spectrum was in control. The principal modus operandi of the government was to
                    control everything from the center; all decisions were made in Athens and the
                    civil service was controlled through the ministries. One of our principal
                    objectives was to break this central stranglehold which, as I said, was based on
                    the French model. The resistance that developed to our concepts came essentially
                    from people who didn't want their perks, their control and their power and
                    influence upset by these Americans who had ideas that didn't fit into “the Greek
                    reality”.</p>
                <p>We were not, as was the case later in some of our public administration programs,
                    located in the ministries. We had an office in downtown Athens in the Tamion
                    Building. We occupied three or four floors in this building. The Embassy was two
                    or three blocks away. At that time, the Ambassador was in many ways eclipsed by
                    the Marshall Plan Mission Director. After John Nuveen left, Paul Porter came
                    from the regional office in Paris. That office was headed by Governor Averell
                    Harriman and Porter—a very distinguished economist—was one of his right hand
                    men. Porter brought as his deputy Leland Barrows who later joined the Foreign
                    Service and became Ambassador to the Cameroon. When Leland succeeded Porter as
                    Director I left the “Civil Government” Division and moved to the front office to
                    become Barrows' special assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that job, let me pursue the question of
                        the atmosphere in Athens in those days. Was it a chaotic situation? Was the
                        infrastructure—communications, transportation, etc.—adequate for a
                        decentralized government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The situation on the ground was extremely difficult. The wars had left
                    the country in a shambles. There were very few first class roads; the
                    communications system was mediocre at best; the power supply was very erratic.
                    The Greek countryside was in terrible disarray; many villages had been bombed,
                    particularly in the north. There was severe damage. That made a relief and
                    reconstruction effort very urgent. It had to be mounted just to provide minimal
                    shelter and to get food into the country. Much of that work was done by the
                    Marshall Plan. We imported vast quantities of wheat, flour, and other food
                    stuffs.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But in some ways, these rather chaotic conditions in effect gave further impetus
                    to the notion of decentralization. Greece had Nomarchs who knew well their
                    provinces and their problems. Given any kind of sustenance and resources, a
                    Nomarch could apply remedies effectively to the problem areas. To a certain
                    extent, although it went against the grain, we were successful in strengthening
                    the hands of the Nomarchs and perhaps as important as decentralization, was the
                    grudgingly accepted principle that the Nomarch would be chosen on merit. They
                    needed to be people of proven ability to resolve these very difficult problems;
                    they were not to be chosen because of their political connections as had been
                    true in the past. In the past, they were appointed by the government; they were
                    friends of the Prime Minister or some Minister. That happened, unfortunately,
                    even during the Marshall Plan days, but we insisted and I think successfully
                    managed to increase greatly the number that were appointed for their abilities.
                    The jobs were of some status, position, and importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the “Civil Government” Division push
                        decentralization so hard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: It made for greater efficiencies and vastly improved the flow of
                    resources to those who needed them. When you are confronted with a situation in
                    which the local people can deal with their own problems with greater efficiency
                    and understanding than a bureaucrat at a desk far away, it is obviously more
                    efficient and effective to give the authority to the local officials who know
                    the problems first-hand. The people in Athens rarely left their offices. I was
                    in Greece for a little less than four years, but by my third year, I had
                    traveled all over Greece and knew more about the conditions of Greek villages
                    than the officials in the Ministry of Interior in Athens, who rarely, as I said,
                    left their offices. In part they were over-burdened by paper work; in part they
                    were inclined to give orders from their desks. Our support of decentralization
                    was a practical approach. We strongly believed in local government and in the
                    ability of people to order their own affairs with greater efficiency and equity,
                    to that extent we supported decentralization on philosophical grounds. But
                    essentially our support came for practical reasons.</p>
                <p>Russell Drake headed our Division. He had had extensive experience as a senior
                    member of the “Public Administration Service”, a non-profit consulting firm that
                    was based on the campus of the University of Chicago, although not formally
                    affiliated with the University. It was part of the “Public Administration
                    Clearing House” that had been established under the auspices of the
                    University.</p>
                <p>My two years with the Civil Government Division were busy and exciting. Shortly
                    after I arrived, we had a major postal strike in Greece. The Athens central
                    office was filled to the ceiling with packages; it was absolutely chaotic since
                    the workers were on strike for several weeks. The strike was economically
                    driven; the workers were hurting. The government had been inept in dealing with
                    its finances, partly because of the lack of resources and partly because it kept
                    running the printing presses, causing serious inflation that, at the time,
                    created unrest and hardships for the workers.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I should add at this point that later one of our great successes in Greece was to
                    bring about a stabilization program, which brought inflation down to reasonable
                    levels and made the Greek drachma a stable currency.</p>
                <p>I was asked to provide assistance to the Post Office in its efforts to reorganize
                    itself. I was barely out of graduate school and I was supposed to help
                    reorganize a whole country's postal system. I established a very close
                    relationship with the Director General of the Post Office, Mr. John Frangakis, a
                    man from Crete. He and I were able to get some counterpart funds which went for
                    new equipment and for rebuilding some of the post offices that had been
                    destroyed in the war. We worked out new systems for mail distribution that made
                    some sense. We traveled around Greece together. It was a very rewarding
                    experience. In the end it was the Post Office that reformed itself; I
                    contributed a few ideas, but Frangakis and his staff really did the job. We
                    managed to buy some needed equipment and that which was already available was
                    used more effectively. Some of Athens' post offices were enlarged; new branch
                    offices were built in addition to those that were repaired. My experience in
                    reorganizing the Greek Post Office was a good illustration of the extent of the
                    influence of the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>I was given a similar assignment with the Patent Office. I did some research on
                    this subject and canvassed ideas from my colleagues who were familiar with new
                    methods of sorting data. These were the days before the computer. So we devised
                    some methods to identify and catalogue a vast amount of data. The Greeks had
                    many books full of pasted-in pictures of patents; there was no categorization.
                    The patents were glued in as they came to the Office, one after the other with
                    no intelligible sequence. I developed a system for them that helped find data
                    when needed and established a basis for comparison. This job took a few
                    months.</p>
                <p>I also became involved in setting up a program for self-help construction for
                    villages. The General Secretary of the Ministry of Interior and I would jointly
                    allocate millions of Greek drachmas from counterpart funds to villages that were
                    willing to provide volunteer construction labor. We would provide the cement,
                    the pipes for water mains, etc. for small infrastructure projects. The work, as
                    I indicated, was done by volunteer construction workers. At a fraction of the
                    costs of building a school or a bridge or a culvert through the usual
                    contractual ways, villagers would get together with local artisans and builders
                    and would build whatever structure the village wanted. The Marshall Plan,
                    through the Greek government, would supply the material required. The
                    participation in this program was the most satisfying experience of my Greek
                    assignment. For a few million drachmas—or the equivalent of one or two million
                    dollars—we were able to fund a vast array of construction projects in village
                    after village in Greece. My role was to help devise a system which would
                    identify the village and the project and would get the material to the right
                    place in a timely way. I did a lot of follow-up work. I traveled widely looking
                    at how the projects were developing. I still have pictures of some of the
                    bridges, culverts, schools, clinics, recreation centers that were built under
                    this program. It was very, very successful and a very gratifying effort.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been the forefather of the many projects
                        that AID implemented years later in the Third World.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I know it was tried in some African countries but there the population
                    had only a limited tradition of volunteer labor. Greece was different, in part
                    because it had a tradition of self-help and in part because of great need; there
                    the program was successful. The local Nomarchs were extremely helpful. By that
                    time, partly because of U.S. pressure, the Nomarchs were independent
                    decision-makers, first among equals vis a vis other ministry representatives in
                    the field and were very helpful in identifying their needs. I came to know them
                    all personally. It was a very successful and rewarding experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Civil Government Division of which you were a member
                        was rather small. Did all Ministries have advice from that Division?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: No, because it was so small. We had a Finance Division which dealt with
                    financial policy issues and allocation of funds. It dealt with the Ministry of
                    Finance, but it was not concerned with the management of the Ministry. Our
                    Finance Division concentrated on policy issues.</p>
                <p>Given the limited number of staffers in the Civil Government Division, we
                    concentrated on local government, the civil service and the whole
                    decentralization effort. We did get involved in some activities, such as the
                    ones I described earlier, which were in effect supporting decentralization. They
                    required a local decision whether by an official or a council or a Nomarch with
                    the central ministries playing only a coordinating role, which was their
                    appropriate function. The impact of the Civil Government Division on the Greek
                    government in general was not large; it did not try to reorganize the whole
                    government, but it certainly had an impact on the Greek approach to governing
                    the whole country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1951, you became the special assistant to the
                        Marshall Plan Mission Director. How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I was able to speak and read Greek and that was the reason I got the job.
                    The Mission Director's daily staff meeting was preceded by a quick briefing on
                    the contents of the daily Greek press. It was a volatile press and highly
                    influential. We were always interested in what the press was saying, both the
                    pro-government press and the opposition's. The press had a considerable
                    influence on the way the Greek people viewed the Marshall Plan program. The
                    press lacked those journalistic ethics that one considers appropriate for the
                    modern Western press. Nevertheless, it was a very important factor in shaping
                    public opinion.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The officer who had the job before me was Foreign Service officer on loan to the
                    Marshall Plan. His name was Dan Brewster. He spoke Greek fluently and read it
                    easily. He was the Director's special assistant. When Dan was transferred, I was
                    asked by Barrows, who had by that time become Director, to assume the role. In
                    addition to the morning press review, the job required a whole range of
                    relationships linking the Director to his staff. I would follow-up on various
                    assignments made by the Director. I was also given some special assignments from
                    time to time on which I worked independently. For example, I did a comparative
                    study on a particular investment proposal for a power supply system to ascertain
                    if it made any sense. So the job entailed a variety of tasks. My perspective
                    from the front office, it gave me insights into the workings of the entire large
                    organization. I was privy to all the meetings that Barrows had with the Greek
                    government. I went with the Director to all the meetings and, although there
                    were always official translators present, I was able to pick up nuances and side
                    talks that were missed in the translation. I was also the note taker. It was an
                    extraordinarily good experience.</p>
                <p>The central theme during my last two years in Athens was “stabilization” of the
                    Greek economy. We recruited as head of our finance office a brilliant economist,
                    Ed Tenenbaum, who had helped General Clay in achieving the “German miracle”—the
                    revival of the German economy. He was one of Clay's right-hand men. We became
                    very good friends. In Germany, the centerpiece of the economic revival was a
                    currency reform—the actual elimination of the existing mark and its replacement
                    by a new mark. Ed was intent on doing the same thing in Greece. We had inflated
                    drachmas. He wanted to introduce a new drachma with a new exchange rate.</p>
                <p>This issue raised serious Embassy-Mission tensions. The Greek government was wary
                    of currency reform. It thought it was too radical; it thought it wouldn't work;
                    or if it did work, it would cause great pain and suffering. But Leland Barrows
                    and Ed Tenenbaum and I sought to persuade the Greeks that currency reform, while
                    radical and painful at first, would in the long run be, by far, the most
                    beneficial policy they could pursue. The Economic Counselor, Harry Turkel, wore
                    two hats: he was in charge of the Embassy's Economic Section and he was also
                    economic advisor to the Marshall Plan Mission Director. That organizational
                    scheme was later attempted in a number of posts with aid missions. Harry had two
                    offices: one in the Embassy and one in our building. Charles Yost was the DCM at
                    the time. Jack Peurifoy was the Ambassador, but he was not as involved in
                    economic issues as much as Yost. Yost, Turkel and Norm Anschutz, the Political
                    Counselor, were all opposed to currency reform; they supported a straight
                    orthodox devaluation of the drachma. The debate raged for months.</p>
                <p>On the Greek government side, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Supply,
                    both influential members of the Cabinet, were leaning towards currency reform.
                    The strongest proponent of devaluation was the Minister of Coordination, who was
                    very close to the Prime Minister, General Alexander Papagos, an eminent Greek
                    soldier who tuned out to be quite a successful Prime Minister. So the Greek
                    government was as split as the American.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>A lot of papers were written. I remember well one session that Barrows,
                    Tenenbaum, and I held with the Ministers of Supply and Coordination. There were
                    just the five of us. Barrows led the discussion. He made the case with
                    extraordinary lucidity and clarity. Many of the issues were technical and
                    complicated. I thought it was a masterful presentation, complemented by
                    Tenenbaum who would add examples and refinements. For me, it was a remarkable
                    economics seminar. It was a superb defense of the advantages of currency reform
                    and it further reinforced my own predilections. In the end, we lost. The
                    Minister of Coordination and the Embassy won the argument and the idea of
                    currency reform was dropped. But devaluation did take place and was successful.
                    The value of the currency dropped from 30,000 drachmas to a dollar to 3:1. It
                    worked. There were, of course, large outcries at the beginning. I must say that
                    there were no leaks at all. I was one of the few who knew when it would happen.
                    Barrows and Tenenbaum and a few Embassy officers knew. A few Greek government
                    officials knew. It would have been disastrous if anyone had really known the
                    decision in advance. A lot of people would have defeated the intent by hedging
                    and rushing to buy goods. There were no press stories beyond the usual
                    speculations about financial policy. That was amazing because Greek society was
                    very porous and the press corps active.</p>
                <p>The devaluation policy worked. The Greek drachma stopped being a laughing stock;
                    it became a relatively hard currency. Production was enhanced; inflation
                    dropped. How much more successful currency reform would have been, I have no way
                    of knowing. For the first ten years, it was clear that devaluation and
                    concurrent policies such as keeping the printing presses working at a minimum,
                    and others that a prudent government undertakes to keep its financial house in
                    order, was very beneficial. In more recent times, the drachma has been
                    re-evaluated to 30:1 or 35:1; the Geek government is fighting some of the same
                    problems that we faced in the early 1950s—inflation, deep indebtedness,
                    etc—although perhaps to a lesser degree. They now have the EEC to bail them out
                    as the Marshall Plan did forty years ago.</p>
                <p>There was another problem with the Embassy and that concerned the size of the
                    annual assistance programs. The Embassy invariably advocated larger assistance
                    levels. Curiously enough, during my whole career, it was always the USAID
                    mission that proposed a smaller, more modest allocation of resources to the host
                    government. The embassies, particularly in Athens, always wanted to increase the
                    assistance programs; they always felt that politically they could not “live”
                    with lower levels and I should note that the Greek programs ran into the
                    billions. This question of resource levels was a continual debate particularly
                    after stabilization became successful. Ed Tenenbaum would argue that assistance
                    should be cut in half; Charles Yost would say that it was just not possible. I
                    saw this pattern over and over again in later assignments with the embassy and
                    the aid mission taking opposite sides. I saw it later in Africa, in Ceylon and
                    elsewhere. The U.S. aid levels were a major issue in Greece.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The early 1950s were extraordinary days, during which, even as a young officer, I
                    was exposed to major policy decisions and saw an Embassy-Mission relationship
                    evolve. In those days, the ground-rules for such were fairly murky. Even though
                    murky, the formal relationship was that the Marshall Plan Director was nominally
                    under the general guidance of the Ambassador, but in fact, his chain of command
                    went back to Harriman in Paris and then Paul Hoffman and his successors in
                    Washington and to President Truman and later Eisenhower. That gave the Marshall
                    Plan missions a very strong and independent organizational underpinning. The
                    Director wielded sizeable resources; wherever he went, he was a man of enormous
                    influence and importance. In some respects, he eclipsed the Ambassador, who
                    didn't have millions to give out. But Peurifoy and Barrows got along very well
                    as did Porter and the Ambassador. Although there were some jealousies and
                    rivalries, the relationship did not work too badly. At times, tensions were high
                    between the staffs, but in general we managed to get along amicably.</p>
                <p>The Greek government, receiving differing advice from two parts of the U.S.
                    government, took advantage of the situation. It followed the point of view which
                    it felt was most advantageous to it. For the Greek government, a divided U.S.
                    representation was very useful. It should mentioned that there were also
                    differences between the Embassy and the Mission in how tough we should be in
                    insisting on certain reforms. I remember a famous Porter letter to the Prime
                    Minister in which he outlined the Greek government deficiencies in a number of
                    financial/economic activities. The letter implied that unless corrective
                    measures were undertaken, the assistance levels might well be lowered. I don't
                    think that Porter cleared the letter with the Ambassador, although he may have
                    discussed it with him, probably in very general terms. When the letter, which
                    could be seen as a slap in the face of the Prime Minister, was leaked to the
                    press and published, the Ambassador was less than happy. Yet, given the relative
                    independence at the time of the Mission Director, there was nothing that the
                    Ambassador could do; he could not hem Porter in. But on the whole the Ambassador
                    and the Directors were sensible men and got along tolerably well.</p>
                <p>They did work closely together. I remember a speech that Ambassador Peurifoy gave
                    which was written by the AID Mission staff. He delivered it to the Propeller
                    Club, a group of American businessmen in Greece. The speech castigated Greek
                    government economic policy and used a phrase—:”leopards can not change their
                    spots” which, when translated into Greek, sounded very harsh. He was saying that
                    “leopards” in the government were going to continue down the wrong path. The
                    Greek press, of course, immediately picked up the phrase and it became a slogan
                    for the opposition.</p>
                <p>I also witnessed creative administrative efforts, such as a Joint Administrative
                    Service (JAS), which supported both Embassy and the aid Mission. It was one
                    administrative support organization, headed by Tom Estes. This became a model
                    for later similar efforts in other posts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have discussed two arms of the U.S. government. I would
                        like to ask you about a third one: the military. How did the Mission relate
                        with the U.S. military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Both the military and the intelligence staffs were major U.S. players in
                    Athens. The military were extremely important during the first year of the
                    Marshall Plan because the civil war was still ongoing. As I said, by the time I
                    got to Greece, it had begun to peter out, but then the U.S. military was
                    instrumental in rearming and reequipping the Greek army. The Embassy devised
                    another management innovation: meetings of what is now called the Country Team.
                    The Ambassador, the DCM, the Mission Director, the head of MAAG, the CIA Station
                    Chief, and some of the Embassy's section chiefs would meet periodically. I
                    attended only one such meeting, although I don't remember why. Those meetings
                    were very useful for coordination among the major U.S. agencies. The CIA played
                    a very important role in Greece; it not only established its own sources, but
                    helped the Greeks develop their intelligence capability. The aid Mission had no
                    problems with either the military or the intelligence staffs.</p>
                <p>I should note the Washington scene before we end the Greek experience. The
                    stabilization program was fully supported by the Marshall Plan headquarters in
                    Washington. There were two extraordinarily bright men on that headquarter's
                    Greek desk. The State Department's Greek desk was fairly passive in those days.
                    It didn't contribute much to the policy debate. It was the Marshall Plan's
                    officials, Victor Sulum and his assistant Frank Mann, who were the key
                    architects in Washington. This key policy would have foundered without their
                    steadfast support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1953, you became a program budget coordination officer
                        in the program Budget Office in Washington. What were your responsibilities?
                        What insights did you gain about the nature of our assistance program and
                        the manner in which the assistance agency was then organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Having spent almost four years in Greece, I decided that I should return
                    to the US and seek permanent employment with other than a temporary agency. I
                    still had some notions of pursuing an academic career and even resuming my
                    pursuit of the Ph.D. I resigned my position in Athens and returned home to
                    Chicago via a few days of consultation in Washington.</p>
                <p>By this time, a number of my former colleagues from the Athens mission were in
                    positions at headquarters. Two were particularly helpful: Helene Granby, who had
                    been in the Greek Mission program office, and Manlio DeAngelis. Ms. Granby was
                    in charge of the Program Office of the Far Eastern Bureau and offered me a job
                    in her office. Manny, whom I knew better, was the Deputy Chief of the Program
                    Budget Office of what had become the Foreign Operations Administration headed by
                    Governor Harold Stassen. He also offered me a position in his office.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>After weighing the pros and cons of both assignments, I opted for the Program
                    Budget Office. Manny made a strong and persuasive argument that this was a key
                    office, highly influential in the ultimate decisions on how the resource pie
                    would be sliced. Also, it had very close ties with the Bureau of the Budget and
                    senior staff of the agency. Thus, it was deeply involved in policy decisions
                    because it was astride the budget process.</p>
                <p>The Granby job was also an interesting one in that it would have put me inside a
                    geographic bureau and given me an economic brief to conduct. Ms. Granby,
                    however, as I knew from our days in Athens, had a predilection for very long
                    hours on the job. She was known to have spent some nights sleeping on the couch
                    in her office in the pursuit of her tasks. A workaholic par excellence. With one
                    small child and another on the way, and with all the chores attendant on moving
                    my family from Chicago and settling in Washington, I confess to a reluctance to
                    get ensnared in a Granby-like schedule.</p>
                <p>As things turned out, the endless hours I spent on the FOA budget far exceeded
                    anything I would have encountered in the Far East program office. Our small
                    office of six budget analysts undertook the enormous task of reorganizing and
                    reconciling the vastly different methods of budgeting followed by the agencies
                    that FOA had inherited as the central US aid agency. There were the European
                    programs left from the Marshall Plan conducted by the Mutual Security Agency.
                    Latin American programs were handled by the Institute of Inter-American affairs.
                    In addition, a scattering of programs, mostly in the Middle East and Far East,
                    were run by the “Point Four” agency—the Technical Cooperation
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>While placing these various appropriation accounts into a new FOA set-up, we had
                    ongoing programs to fund with both dollars and local currency allocated between
                    program and administrative categories. Each step of the funding process had to
                    be cleared internally with the central program coordination office headed by
                    Jack Ohly (an administrator of extraordinary brilliance) and the regional
                    bureaus. Externally, we had to go through a tedious apportionment and
                    re-apportionment drill with the Bureau of the Budget. Elaborate justifications
                    had to be prepared for the BoB analysts as to why we needed this amount of money
                    now. This required frequent analysis of funds in the pipeline to attest that the
                    need was urgent.</p>
                <p>For someone whose fiscal savvy and numerate ability was not of the highest order,
                    I found myself floundering to find my footing and to understand the intricacies
                    of the complex task entrusted to me. My geographic area of concern was Europe,
                    where the programs were on the wane, and Africa, with modest new beginning.
                    Thanks to my most competent and patient supervisor, Arthur McGlaughlin, and to
                    the coaching and advice of Mary Jane “Mike” Wichser, now Mrs. Donner, the clouds
                    of confusion in due course lifted.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>But the hours were endless. Rarely would I reach home before midnight. Every
                    weekend was spent on the job and holidays as well. On our first Easter in
                    Washington I spent the entire day and part of the night at the office. I recall
                    Mike Wichser helping me until 3:00 a.m. one morning as we poured over a large
                    spread sheet of numbers to find a missing $ 0.1 ($100,000) so as to reconcile an
                    account. It should be noted that this occurred before the days of the computer,
                    word processor and calculator. Our only equipment was an adding machine.</p>
                <p>In the end the job got done well, thanks to the devoted work of a very talented
                    staff, but the long hours did not abate much. This was indeed a key office
                    although only on the periphery of the policy process. Jack Ohly and his staff
                    made the basic decisions and we executed them by managing the tedious paper
                    trail. So, it was with great joy that I acceded to an offer by Robert Biren, one
                    of Stassen's boys from Minnesota, to join his Organization and Methods
                    division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1955. What were the general responsibilities
                        in the O&amp;M Office and yours in that Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: This was an extraordinary office. Both Biren and his deputy, Herb Rees,
                    were men of great creativity and intelligence. They brought a verve and an
                    excitement to our tasks that were in sharp contrast to the plodding decorum of
                    the Budget Office.</p>
                <p>The functions it conducted were split into three parts. One was in charge of the
                    scrutiny and vetting of all organizational units that comprised the agency.
                    Analysts were given a particular swath of offices to monitor. My job was to
                    follow the four geographical bureaus and I had four analysts under me to do this
                    job. We also controlled the personnel slots each bureau was assigned. This gave
                    us considerable power as we increased or decreased a staffing pattern based on
                    management audits. The other two parts of the office were responsible for office
                    systems and methods and for writing and revision of manual orders that were the
                    legal basis for the way the headquarters conducted its business.</p>
                <p>Biren and Rees had recruited an able bunch of young men and one woman. The
                    influence this office wielded over the way the agency operated was palpable.
                    While there were occasional frictions and disagreements, it was a remarkably
                    congenial and personable group of considerable competence.</p>
                <p>There were times when members of my staff went overseas. Tom Stern went to close
                    the missions in Holland and Denmark; Eli Bergman was sent to Libya to help in
                    opening a mission there. He was also sent to Afghanistan on the same trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that O&amp;M was an influential office in the
                        new Foreign Operations Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KONTOS: It was very influential because the agency itself needed streamlining;
                    separate offices had to be merged. Just as in the case of disparate budget
                    accounts, there were organizational alignments that had to be rationalized. Also
                    the O&amp;M leadership undertook a training program. We developed a mock mission
                    “war game”, during which for the first time, people could play different roles
                    and see situations from different perspectives. This was a novel approach which
                    I do not believe had ever been used before. It was an artificial situation, but
                    the problems that the trainees had to solve were real. We would put new agency
                    recruits through this training program using a fictitious country name and data;
                    we provided them with real life problems; we gave them programs for this
                    “mission” to work out. Herb Rees, then the deputy to Bob Biren, was in charge of
                    this training program. It was a very useful and creative initiative. O&amp;M, in
                    addition to playing its normal organizational role in helping to improve the
                    efficiency of the extent agency, also became involved in this important training
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1956, you were transferred to the new position of
                        Executive Director for the Africa- Europe Bureau, which was a new entity.
                        What were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This was an extremely busy period of my career because the European Missions were
                    being phased out and new African Missions established. It seemed to me that it
                    was an almost mindless gesture on the part of the US government that as soon as
                    an African country achieved independence it became the host to a new aid
                    mission. My job was to staff those missions—to find first rate people to head
                    them and good people to manage the new programs. It was an enormously busy time.
                    We had to quickly put in place new missions in North Africa—Tunisia, Libya,
                    Morocco. We established missions in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria (even though the
                    latter two were still under British rule and our missions there were “liaison
                    offices”). All this required a lot of travel; I spent many weeks overseas,
                    particularly in North Africa. During this period of travel, I spent a few days
                    in Khartoum where a new aid mission was being organized. Little did I dream that
                    about 20 years later I would arrive there as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Then there were the annual meetings of mission directors which we had to organize
                    and set the agenda. There were new country desks in Washington to staff as new
                    missions were established. Fortunately, there were several good people who had
                    left the European Marshall Plan programs and were now available to run the new
                    programs. That was a great boon because they were on the whole a very competent
                    group. The veterans of European assistance programs had experience and talent
                    and could be readily deployed to develop and support new assistance programs in
                    other parts of the world. Since the European specialists had been part of the
                    same Bureau that was handling African programs their transition to new
                    Africa/Europe Bureau was a simple process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you joined the Foreign Operations Agency (FOA) it was
                        a new organization trying to establish itself. When you became the Executive
                        Director of the new Bureau, had the Agency pretty much finished its shake
                        down period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I think it had, although it should be said, that even though the Agency
                    had settled down and there had been some coherence in the way the new Bureau was
                    administered, there was great anxiety because we were in the midst of the
                    McCarthy period. A number of our personnel files were reviewed by security and
                    one or two of our employees became targets. Thus for an extended period we had
                    to deal with the new emphasis on security issues raised by Governor Stassen and
                    his staff. But I don't recall anyone in the Africa/Europe Bureau having been
                    fired for not measuring up to the new criteria. That was the only continuing
                    instability. By 1956, the Agency was reasonably well run.</p>
                <p>I might just add that I found it curious that, during this period, that the State
                    Department role was not very prominent. When I traveled to the field, I would
                    meet with the Ambassador and his staff, but as I look back on it, in Washington
                    there was little interchange with State on African programs. It is true, of
                    course, that the Bureau of African Affairs in State was at the time also in its
                    formative stages, going through the usual growing pains of becoming an
                    independent bureau. Governor “Soapy” Williams, when he became Assistant
                    Secretary, gave further impetus to the U.S. knee jerk reaction to establish new
                    aid missions whenever a new African country was born. But I, although by this
                    time a relatively senior official in the Africa/Europe Bureau, had relatively
                    little contact with the State Department. Q: Then in 1959, you returned overseas
                    and were assigned to Sri Lanka (Ceylon then) as the Deputy Director of the AID
                    Mission. How did that come about?</p>
                <p>KONTOS: I had for some time wanted to go back overseas. I always felt that most
                    of the joys and the challenges in our agency were overseas. So I welcomed an
                    overseas assignment. Since I knew what vacancies would be occurring in the
                    African Bureau, I considered filling one of them. There were two possibilities:
                    one was Salisbury (Rhodesia) as a liaison officer with the British colonial
                    government or, as an alternative, a similar job in Nairobi (Kenya), where the
                    British were already phasing out. Nairobi would have been more substantive since
                    we had already initiated several projects with the approval and cooperation of
                    the British government. Though Nairobi itself with its salubrious climate and
                    setting was attractive, I would have been by myself in a colony (though in the
                    process of becoming independent) and where the British would allow only a
                    marginal US role. Then came the opportunity to go to South Asia to become the
                    deputy director in an already established mission with an established hierarchy
                    and programs.</p>
                <p>Jim Grant had been the Director of the AID Mission in Ceylon. His successor was
                    John Roach who was the mission's Legal Advisor when I was in Athens. I knew him
                    fairly well when he asked me to join him as his deputy. I opted to accept that
                    offer rather than Nairobi.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I arrived in Colombo in early 1959; John Roach was already there. We had a small
                    mission which was facing a difficult environment in which to operate. The
                    government had moved sharply to the left and was seeking to achieve a socialist
                    approach. It had nationalized a number of key industries and services and it was
                    engaged in a highly dubious government-dominated economic program. It also was
                    racist; it gave full support to one linguistic, religious and cultural group,
                    the majority Buddhist Singhalese to the detriment of the Hindu Tamils who were a
                    large and very important minority. There was a resurgence of latent animosity
                    that had always existed between these two groups and that, in the past, had been
                    suppressed by the British. In fact, the British had favored the Tamils in part
                    because, as a minority, were perhaps better motivated. They tended to be better
                    educated, were better civil servants, and the British thought that them
                    smarter.</p>
                <p>The British approach meant that when Ceylon reached independence, the senior
                    civil service included a high proportion of Tamils. English remained the
                    language of education and of governmental affairs. The regime of S.W.R.D.
                    Bandaranaike, after a fair election, had supplanted the regime of what he called
                    the “Black Englishmen”—the United National Party, which had been the first
                    ruling party after independence. Bandaranaike headed a party that was nativist,
                    Buddhist, socialist, and in power when I arrived in Ceylon. For every step
                    forward that the aid Mission took in trying to deal affirmatively with the
                    problems of underdevelopment, the government would take two backwards. It was a
                    very discouraging atmosphere for an aid mission to operate in.</p>
                <p>I therefore argued that we should reduce our program. It was a situation in which
                    we were making little, if any progress. This view got me involved in one of the
                    major confrontations of my career. I was espousing a point of view that was
                    unpopular both in Colombo and in Washington. In this case, which is an exception
                    to the general rule I mentioned earlier that embassies tended to support larger
                    aid programs, there was an Ambassador, Bernard Gufler, who agreed with me and
                    supported my point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I must say that the British had left Ceylon in remarkably good shape. They had
                    created three of the major foreign exchange earning industries: rubber, coconut,
                    and tea. They had taken barren hills and developed productive tea and rubber
                    plantations and coconut groves. They left Ceylon an excellent road system, a
                    good civil service, a quite adequate educational system, and, on the whole, an
                    exchequer that was in reasonably good order. The Ceylonese took these good
                    legacies and turned them into a series of economic declines, by their
                    spectacularly inept socialist orthodoxy which skewed badly their approach to
                    economic development. Ceylonese politics spawned an extraordinary phenomenon,
                    i.e., the largest Trotskyist Party in the world and a number of Marxist and
                    socialist smaller parties. Therefore, Ceylon was generally oriented in its
                    governmental policies in a socialist direction; they assumed that the State was
                    omniscient and knew better how an economy should be conducted than the private
                    sector. Bandaranaike threatened to nationalize the tea estates as soon as he
                    took power and nationalized the rubber plantations. It was enough for the threat
                    of nationalization to exist. The estates and plantations were primarily financed
                    and managed by foreigners who reduced their investments in the maintenance and
                    expansion of these natural resources since the future looked fairly bleak for
                    private enterprise. There ensued an almost immediate decline in the production
                    of the three major export commodities. This was accompanied by a growing
                    anti-Tamil agitation including a declaration of Singhalese as the national
                    language to be used by government officials exclusively. This governmental
                    policy of reducing Tamil influence and power, of course, increased the tensions
                    between the two Ceylonese ethnic groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what the aid Mission was to do about the
                        declining economic conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Our Mission was small. We had a few development loans, but we did not see
                    ourselves as a factor in influencing government policy. I thought that was a
                    mistake since we were contributing, although modestly, to the development of the
                    country. Our assistance should have permitted us to express our views on
                    government economic policy. I personally made some attempts with the Ministry of
                    Finance and the Central Bank staffs to discuss the negative effects of the
                    government's policies. Those policies were clearly detrimental to sound
                    development. But these negative policies were not viewed as a central concern of
                    the Mission, much to my dismay.</p>
                <p>Our technical assistance was provided primarily to the agricultural sector. We
                    tried to foster some small business enterprises. We had a very successful health
                    program, including the continuation of a good malaria eradication program that
                    WHO had initiated. We provided some useful engineering assistance. We had
                    nothing to do with the three major export crops.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The development loans were modest and directed toward infrastructure, e.g. power
                    and roads. I should mention that other countries had programs in Ceylon as well:
                    British, Canadians, Japanese, Scandinavian (Norway primarily). The Colombo Plan
                    had its headquarters in Ceylon. That program covered all of Southeast Asia,
                    including Ceylon. There was a pretty good informal exchange among the donors.
                    The principal avenue for coordination was the Colombo Plan, whose chairman was
                    responsible for making sure that the donors were all in sync.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me return to the political issue. What was our
                        relationship with Ceylon in 1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: It was cordial. They viewed us as a friendly country. They were inclined
                    to give the Soviets, who had a large Embassy there, the benefit of the doubt.
                    The home-grown Marxists and Socialists were not particularly friendly towards us
                    and they did represent a fairly sizeable element within the government. Q: You
                    mentioned your relationship with the Ambassador. How did that develop and what
                    was the role of the Mission Director?</p>
                <p>KONTOS: The Director saw his role as an implementor of the existing program and
                    did not offer any initiatives of his own. He tended to be a passive leader. He
                    and the Ambassador, while maintaining cordial relationships on the surface, had
                    in fact some personality conflicts; they did not really get along very well. The
                    Ambassador was a stickler for correct English and precision in the use of the
                    language. The Director was a lawyer who felt that his English was adequate for
                    communications to Washington. This resulted in some silly difficulties over the
                    use of words and syntax. The Ambassador seemed to prefer my style: being brief
                    and to the point. On a couple of occasions he commended me as a teacher does
                    when grading a paper.</p>
                <p>The relationship with the Embassy was good on the whole. The Economic Counselor
                    was very cordial and helpful; the DCM was helpful, as was the Political
                    Counselor. We had no problems with the Embassy, at least initially. Later, as it
                    became clear to me and ultimately to the Ambassador, that our assistance was not
                    being used in an optimal way, tension did rise somewhat. The aid program was not
                    effective either in quantitative or qualitative ways. The Mission Director
                    wanted to expand the loan program and increase our involvement in agricultural
                    development and other efforts. I thought that such a move would be
                    counter-productive. I thought we should be in fact contracting and drafted
                    cables to that effect. The Director modified or rejected many of these drafts,
                    but in the Country Team meetings that I would often attend because the Director
                    was frequently absent due to health problems, I would set forth my point of
                    view, which would, on the whole, be supported by the Ambassador. That became a
                    bit awkward when messages were drafted and sometimes sent, based on Country Team
                    discussions, that the Director, upon return to his office, found incompatible
                    with his own views. I don't want to leave the impression that we had a large
                    policy gulf between us, but the Director was more inclined to maintain the
                    program and perhaps even enlarge it somewhat than I was. In the end, the
                    Director had to leave for health reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I stayed on for another six months or so with the new director, Jim Baird, who
                    had just transferred from Indonesia, which had a much larger program. The new
                    Director was a strong proponent of a much larger program in Ceylon. He wanted a
                    bigger, better, and shinier assistance program. He thought that our efforts had
                    been much too modest. I had been the Acting Director for an extended period. It
                    was clear from my early contacts with the new Director that my more
                    conservative, modest program goals were completely contrary to his views. Hence
                    there was a difference of views at the outset. I was shortly to be transferred
                    to my great relief. His views prevailed within the aid mission, but the
                    Ambassador was not happy with the proposed new directions. This gave rise to a
                    period of hiatus during which program goals were not articulated; no specific
                    new proposals were sent to Washington because of the local policy disagreements
                    although it must have been clear to Washington from the messages that were sent
                    in fact what each side had in mind. The Ceylonese government was of course
                    pressing for higher aid levels. They wanted more assistance because we
                    essentially fed the government apparatus. For example, one major project, which
                    John Roach had pushed, was to support a government-run factory for the
                    manufacture of small agricultural tools which would be designed to meet the
                    particular requirements of Ceylonese agriculture. He assigned a full-time
                    American agriculture advisor to the factory. We ended up with a big government
                    corporation having a relatively large overhead, with expensive production
                    facilities not driven by profit requirements and, therefore, not concerned with
                    efficiency. So we ended up supporting a white elephant—perhaps a baby white
                    elephant—run by the government. It is not surprising that the government was
                    delighted by our largesse.</p>
                <p>Our technical assistance program in general was very generous. The debate on the
                    nature and extent of our assistance program to Ceylon concerned how flexible a
                    concept could we make of our technical assistance program. The first Mission
                    Director, Jim Grant—a very creative bureaucrat, had worked out a plan that while
                    maintaining the fiction of a technical assistance program in fact spilled over
                    into a project development program. For example, under the guise of a
                    “demonstration”, he initiated the building of a highway. By stretching the
                    meaning of the phrase “technical assistance” he would in fact build a road which
                    was in essence a developmental project. We brought in bull-dozers and
                    construction supervisors and material to build a road that was far removed from
                    Colombo. We built this road to American interstate highway specifications to
                    serve as a model to Ceylon's road engineers. It ended up as a multi-million
                    dollar project, but all under the heading of technical assistance. That was just
                    one illustration of Jim's bureaucratic ingenuity. The road itself was far too
                    expensive to be at all relevant to Ceylon's needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>When I returned to Washington after the end of my tour, I made a strong pitch at
                    all levels that we were really wasting our resources in Ceylon and should be
                    cutting back, not expanding. If we wanted to have any impact, I suggested that
                    we concentrate in a few areas such as agriculture and particularly rice
                    cultivation. But I found no sympathy in AID-Washington for a reduced assistance
                    program even though the Ceylon government was embarked on reducing the private
                    sector through confiscation and other actions. No one wanted to reduce the
                    program; there was no sympathy for my view of the situation. State showed some
                    support, but it was not strong enough to bring about any policy change. It was
                    clearly seen as an AID issue. Most of the concerns in the Near East and South
                    Asia Bureau (NESA) of AID at that time had to do with India and Pakistan; Ceylon
                    did not loom large on the agenda.</p>
                <p>Looking back on my Ceylon experience, the professional rewards may not have been
                    great because our assistance efforts were obviously not making much of a dent,
                    but personally and culturally the tour there was very congenial. The rich and
                    fascinating ancient Buddhist and Hindu cultures from the 2d to the 12th Century
                    were of great interest. We found the Ceylonese to be extremely warm and
                    friendly; they were easy to know well, they were very social and out-going. We
                    still have many friends there with whom we correspond regularly. We led a good
                    and interesting two years in Colombo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had an opportunity while serving in Ceylon to watch
                        two Bandaranaikes as Prime Ministers. What were your impressions of
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was a scion of one the most distinguished
                    families in Ceylon. From an old line Buddhist family, the Bandaranaikes were
                    extremely well treated by the British. His father had been knighted by the
                    British government. The initials stand for Simon West Ridgeway Dias. He was
                    brought up in the Church of England; he went to Oxford and returned to Ceylon as
                    a “proper black Englishman,” as his opposition party called people like himself.
                    When he returned as a young man, he sensed that the UNP, the party that came to
                    power after British withdrawal, could be unseated if one could appeal to
                    Singhalese emotions. In fact, his party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, did start
                    a blatant anti-Tamil campaign—anti-Hindu, racial. In a short period of time,
                    that platform evoked an enormous emotional reaction that in the year before we
                    arrived in Ceylon (1958), resulted in a major Singhalese uprising led by some
                    local hoods. A real blood bath took place. Tamils were taken off buses and
                    killed. It was correctly called the “Massacre of 1958.” The root spark for this
                    mob action was Bandaranaike's pandering to Singhalese emotions. It was a
                    terribly bloody affair. S.W.R.D. took off his coat and tie, put on native dress
                    and sandals and went around inflaming the Singhalese population, which, until
                    that time, had been living peacefully side by side with their Tamil neighbors
                    for more than a century under British rule.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Late in 1958, an election was held and Bandaranaike's Freedom Party won. They
                    held a good Parliamentary majority. It should be noted that from the late 1950s
                    to today Ceylon has had a functioning parliamentary system with voting counted
                    more or less accurately. That is quite remarkable given the vagaries of
                    political life in that country. When S.W.R.D. became Prime Minister, he began to
                    dismantle many of the private sector institutions that the British had
                    established and left behind. He nationalized, for example, the port of Colombo
                    which had been a flourishing enterprise. He kicked the British out of
                    Trincomalee, a great harbor, where they had a naval base; it became a ghost
                    town. The Freedom Party did a lot of foolish things, including, as I mentioned
                    earlier, threatening to nationalize the tea estates, although that was did not
                    happen while I was there.</p>
                <p>In September 1959, the Prime Minister was assassinated by a possibly deranged
                    Buddhist monk who thought that Bandaranaike was not sufficiently orthodox in his
                    religious views. No one is sure even today what the motivation was or whether
                    the monk was fronting for a cabal that wanted S.W.R.D. dead. There was an
                    interim government and then Mrs. Bandaranaike, his wife, won a by-election in a
                    constituency dominated by the family. After becoming a member of Parliament, she
                    was chosen by the Freedom Party to be head of the Party and, therefore, Prime
                    Minister. She continued her husband's policies in perhaps an even more dogmatic
                    and rigid fashion. She brought into the government as Minister of Finance Felix
                    Bandaranaike, a nephew of hers. He had been educated in British schools and was
                    a flaming socialist—perhaps even Marxist. He was also a flaming opportunist and
                    the two Bandaranaikes managed to accelerate the decline of the Ceylonese
                    economy.</p>
                <p>When I left Ceylon, the country was really on the skids. Years later, when I was
                    AID Mission Director in Pakistan, the officer who was the labor expert in the
                    Greek Mission when I was there, Alan Strachan, became Director of the Colombo
                    Plan. His daughter, Heather, whom we knew as a little girl, later married Tom
                    Foley, now the Speaker of the House. The marriage took place in Colombo and we
                    were invited to come to the wedding. Unfortunately, we arrived in Colombo the
                    day after the wedding because Ceylon Airways had over-booked and we were delayed
                    for a day in Bombay. In any case, the word got around that we had arrived in
                    Colombo and our friends all got together at a great party at the AID Mission
                    Director's home. This was in 1968. We of course wandered around Colombo while we
                    were there. It was depressing. There had been no new building since we had
                    served there eight years earlier. The lack of maintenance was noticeable. We saw
                    a city in decline, falling apart. The people were still as happy and as friendly
                    and as ebullient as ever but very distressed by what was happening to their
                    economy which was in a real free-fall.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Eventually, the Bandaranaikes were thrown out; the UNP came back to govern. Under
                    the leadership of a new Prime Minister, the economy began to be freed up; the
                    port was returned to private hands. Now Sri Lanka is flourishing again
                    economically, although the deep-seated Tamil-Singhalese animosities have not
                    abated. In fact, a civil war is still on-going in Sri Lanka and I attribute that
                    tension to a legacy of the policies, words and acts of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. He
                    has much to answer for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Marxists and the Trotskyites get their
                        philosophical base and how did they use it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The Trotskyites learned their catechism in Madison, Wisconsin. The head
                    of that party had been a student at the University of Wisconsin. He apparently
                    became involved with the resident campus Trotskyites, and returned to Ceylon
                    after absorbing an American political science education. In my days, he was the
                    Minister of Agriculture. He was very much the agricultural czar. So our
                    technical assistance program was in fact supporting this Trotskyite and our
                    projects in keeping with his philosophy. We, of course, were doing what we
                    thought would be helpful to Ceylon, like the government factory for small
                    agricultural tools, but in fact we were following his views which were rooted in
                    Trotsky's philosophy. The Minister was extremely bright, well read; when he
                    wasn't talking politics, he was quite congenial and a good conversationalist.
                    But his basic approach was certainly founded on Trotsky's views. He was for
                    nationalization, although I am not sure that he would ever have gone as far as
                    collectivization. Trotsky would probably not have devastated Russian agriculture
                    as much as Stalin did.</p>
                <p>I have often thought about the imposition of Russian philosophy on the Ceylonese
                    culture. It happened that Trotskyism was congenial to them. It may be that the
                    sense of hierarchy represented by that philosophy, which sought to stimulate a
                    contented and productive peasantry ruled by an elite, was in harmony with
                    Ceylonese aspirations and view of the “good life”. There must have been
                    something in the Ceylonese character that made Trotskyism acceptable because
                    that philosophy found a fruitful ground for those views. It must be said that
                    the more orthodox Marxist philosophy did not grow deep roots; the Ceylonese
                    learned from their experiences and saw where a Marxist path would lead them.
                    Even when they played around with Marxism, they did accept aid from capitalist
                    countries, although it had to be essentially on their terms. In looking back on
                    that period, I am amazed by how generous, if not foolhardy, we were in providing
                    aid. We certainly were far short of rigorous: I am appalled when I think of what
                    projects and programs we supported with American resources, even under a strong
                    Republican administration of President Eisenhower. I think Stassen was still in
                    charge of the assistance program in 1961 when I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment was as Deputy Director of the AID
                        Mission in Nigeria. That began in 1961. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KONTOS: When I returned to Washington, it was at the end of the of the Eisenhower
                    administration and the beginning of the Kennedy era. The Kennedys must have
                    developed fairly detailed plans of what they would do once they were in charge.
                    They had decided that the American assistance program would be managed by a new
                    entity called “The Agency for International Development” (AID), replacing the
                    Foreign Operations Administration. The Development Loan Fund was going to be
                    merged into the new institution. Many of the DLF people, like Ed Hutchinson, Art
                    McLaughlin and John Ulinski were transferred to AID. I was here in Washington
                    during this transition. The new Assistant Administrator for Administration who
                    was responsible for setting up the new agency asked me to work with him. I may
                    have come by that assignment through Bill Parks. So for six months I worked in
                    the establishment of AID doing various management studies, etc.</p>
                <p>In 1961, Nigeria gained its independence. So what had been the small office of an
                    aid representative became a full grown AID Mission. The Agency sent Joel
                    Bernstein out as Mission Director. I had known Joel from the Africa-Europe
                    Bureau days where he had been the Program Officer. He asked me to join him as
                    his Deputy. I accepted and when I finished my temporary assignment, we—my wife
                    and my two children—went off to Lagos. We arrived in the summer of 1961 for a
                    three year tour.</p>
                <p>That assignment was an extraordinary experience because Nigeria was a newly
                    independent country, the largest country in Africa with lots of energy and
                    talent. It had a pretty good civil service on the whole, reflecting the British
                    legacy. A number of Britishers were still in key civil service positions. Joel
                    had developed an ambitious and large assistance program. The Mission was
                    first-class, staffed with very competent people. Haven North was the Program
                    Officer. Sam Thornburg was the Administrative Officer. The economists working
                    for Haven were excellent. The education people were first class as were the
                    agriculture experts. The team in Lagos was relatively small, but we had branches
                    in the three main provincial capitals: Enugu in the Southeast, Zaria in the
                    North and Ibadan in the West.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Joe Palmer, who had arrived in Lagos before independence, became the first U.S.
                    Ambassador and was there for most of my tenure. The assistance program focused
                    on agriculture, education, and to some extent on infrastructure development. It
                    was primarily a program of technical assistance; we had some minor development
                    loans, but they weren't that important. The program was large, with sizeable
                    contracts awarded to Michigan State University, for example, which was brought
                    in to work at Nsukka in Eastern Nigeria, where the University of Nigeria was
                    established. When I arrived in Nigeria, Nsukka was an open field. By the time I
                    left, a thriving University had been built by the Michigan State people with
                    U.S. aid funds. We also helped the University of Lagos as well as the University
                    of Northern Nigeria in Zaria. So we really mounted a major educational
                    assistance effort. One of our American staff was an eccentric Pole who helped
                    the Nigerians revise the Nigerian primary and secondary school curricula. I
                    should note that our efforts were supported by the first Governor-General,
                    Nnamdi Azikiwe (”Zik”), who himself was a product of the American educational
                    system, having graduated from Lincoln College. He became a close friend of Dr.
                    John Hannah, then Chancellor of Michigan State and later Administrator of AID.
                    Whenever Hannah visited Nigeria, the Governor General would put him up in his
                    quarters. He was treated like a royal personage. We had some difficult problems
                    dealing with Michigan State because of this personal relationship between the
                    President of Michigan State and the Governor General. Hannah also had a close
                    personal relationship with President Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>We had another large contract with Arthur D. Little that was very ambitious and
                    perhaps one of our least successful endeavors. We tried through this contract to
                    provide assistance to the small business community of Nigeria; to encourage its
                    growth and development. We tried to improve entrepreneurial competence. Each of
                    the three provinces had Arthur D. Little representatives trying to develop a
                    small business ethos and competence. We had to confront an issue that to this
                    day baffles me: how do you convey entrepreneurial skills to different cultures?
                    In Nigeria, we tried it within a Muslim culture in the North, in a Christian and
                    Animist culture in the East, and, a third mixture in the West. In retrospect,
                    even the concept is mind-boggling, not to mention its implementation. the head
                    of the Mission's section—the Industrial Development Division—responsible for
                    this project was a great activist, Chick Terrell. He was a strong proponent of
                    Arthur D. Little and we spent millions of dollars on this project with little to
                    show for our efforts.</p>
                <p>We had other University contracts. One was with the University of Maryland to
                    develop new teaching techniques through the use of radio and TV. On the
                    education front, we started in a much different direction than that the British
                    had taken. We urged and supported the American concept of land grant colleges.
                    The institution in Eastern Nigeria that Michigan State built was based on its
                    own experiences as a land grant college.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Most of the economic development ideas for Nigeria stemmed from the Mission, in
                    particular from Joel Bernstein. He had a new one every day. The Nigerians were
                    trying to staff a new government. They were trying to find all the competent
                    people they could from a meager supply. They were riven by the divisions that
                    ultimately ended up in a civil war (North-South, East-West). At the center,
                    there was a Governor General, representing the British Crown, and a Prime
                    Minister, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. He was the head of a Cabinet government. Then
                    there were three regional governors with considerable powers. The one in the
                    North, who had the Muslim title of “Sardanna”, was both secular and theological,
                    head of that region, the largest in Nigeria in both land size and population.
                    The governors were appointed by the center, but based on their own considerable
                    political strengths in their own regions. Only in the West, was there
                    competition for political power which created some difficulties. The others were
                    clearly leaders of their regions who would have been selected under any
                    circumstances by the Prime Minister. In theory, these regional governors were
                    autonomous, but in fact they relied heavily on the resources that the center
                    doled out to them. When the oil began to flow in Eastern Nigeria, there was a
                    lot of discussion about the “East having to share its oil revenues for the
                    benefit of the other regions”. There was always a debate over how much of the
                    revenues should be returned to the Eastern province, the usual dilemma when one
                    part of a country produces greater resources than the others.</p>
                <p>While I was there, the underlying concern of all our endeavors was always whether
                    the Nigerian federation would last. The general feeling of all of us, including
                    the Ambassador, was that there was an even chance that it would succeed. We
                    thought there were enough rational people who would see the benefit of
                    continuing the federation and that the government could maintain an appropriate
                    balance among the regions with enough autonomy given to keep the regions
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p>But there were always strains, in addition to the division of oil revenues that I
                    have already mentioned and which became more exacerbated later. One was the
                    census. Population size would determine the distribution of resources. The first
                    census was taken and everybody found it unacceptable. No one would agree that
                    the numbers were anywhere near right. Another one was taken which was also
                    rejected. So the government continued to distribute resources in accordance with
                    the last census taken by the British, which I think was in 1932. Since my days,
                    censuses have been taken, but every time I see some numbers, which now seem to
                    reach close to 140 million people, I have a high degree of skepticism. I don't
                    believe that there are that many Nigerians; I would guess that the more accurate
                    figure is 70-80 million. There is no question that Nigeria is the most populous
                    country in Africa. When we were there, the cash crops—cocoa, bananas,
                    coconuts—were foreign exchange earners. The Nigerians were generally food
                    self-sufficient. When the oil bonanza came in, they blew the opportunity badly.
                    Tribal divisions brought about a civil war, but the country remained intact, as
                    have, incidentally, the boundaries for all African countries which were drawn in
                    Berlin in 1885 and have remained fixed ever since. It is amazing that they are
                    all still intact, given the arbitrary nature of their origins and the lack of
                    any relationship to the situation on the ground, such as tribal groupings.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were Joel Bernstein's relations with the
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Excellent. They saw eye-to-eye on all major issues. The Mission-Embassy
                    relationships were very good as well. The only problem we ever had with other
                    agencies occurred with the Peace Corps which came while I was there. Sargent
                    Shriver, the Director of the Peace Corps, made it clear from the outset that his
                    group would work independently. He was almost rude to the Ambassador. He made
                    eminently clear that he wanted no relationships with the Embassy or any other
                    existing U.S. agency. He sent an advance team that was arrogant—stupidly so—and
                    set the tone for relationships thereafter. But I should say that the Peace Corps
                    directors who came to Lagos, including Bill Saltonstall (whom Shriver had
                    persuaded to leave Exeter) were a very sensible and affable people. Saltonstall
                    took Shriver's bureaucratic nonsense with large grains of salt and was not
                    concerned about the alleged “taint” that any Peace Corps-Embassy relationship
                    was supposed to engender. While I was in Lagos, there was a “postcard” incident
                    which involved a Peace Corps volunteer. The first P.C. contingent to arrive in
                    Nigeria was sent to the University of Ibadan for further training and briefing.
                    While there, it appears that one of the volunteers, Margery Mitchelmore, wrote a
                    postcard to her parents about the quaint habits of Nigerians. She described how
                    the marketplace was strewn with trash and how the Nigerian urinated in the
                    streets. This postcard fell out of her purse and one of the undergraduate
                    students picked it up. The Peace Corps was almost thrown out because of the
                    ensuing uproar. The students were up in arms, the press played it up big and the
                    government was upset. Mitchelmore had to be rapidly spirited to DCM Jerry
                    Greene's residence in an unmarked car. He had to keep her in his house, under
                    wraps, until we could quietly get her out of the country. The uproar over the
                    postcard was enormous. Americans were described as arrogant and insensitive with
                    a feeling of superiority, but it was an isolated incident of anti-Americanism
                    that subsided relatively quickly. In the final analysis, the Peace Corps was a
                    considerable success.</p>

                <p>In general, Americans were welcomed in Nigeria. We were open-handed in our
                    assistance. We poured a lot of money into that country. We had a large program
                    there. With the exception perhaps of our efforts in trying to develop
                    entrepreneurs in the provinces, I think the program was well formulated. We had
                    good people, on the whole, to run it; there were some exceptions, but
                    fortunately they were rare. As in the case of Greece, we had a number of field
                    offices. In each of the three capitals, we had a senior AID representative in
                    charge. This was a useful technique. That man was not a line officer, but rather
                    a coordinator, observer, and liaison with the local government which was headed
                    by a prime minister who had a cabinet of ministers. Nigeria was, in fact, three
                    countries, federated through a super-structure in Lagos. We had to work on a
                    very decentralized basis. Whenever our regional people came to Lagos, we would
                    talk to them and then send them over to the Embassy. They often participated in
                    the Ambassador's staff meetings when they gave briefings of the conditions in
                    the country as observed at first hand. Curiously enough, we never formalized the
                    structure and did not tie these provincial representatives more closely to the
                    Embassy. The Embassy may have missed a bet; on the other hand, I am not sure
                    that AID would have encouraged closer integration. We tended to take a “holier
                    than thou” attitude, as the Peace Corps did, and did not allow our people to do
                    any political reporting. But certainly there was plenty of oral exchange. As I
                    said we had an excellent relationship with the Embassy. George Dolgin was the
                    Economic Counselor; he was a fine fellow. In many ways, our country team efforts
                    in Nigeria were a model.</p>
                <p>After the first two years, I returned to the United States on home leave/return
                    travel orders. But before I could return to Nigeria, I had a meeting with the
                    AID Administrator, David Bell, who requested that I take on a new assignment as
                    Director of Personnel. This was in 1963. I told Bell that we were in the midst
                    of developing a large program for Nigeria, that we were all working very hard to
                    make it a success and that I was very reluctant to leave Joel Bernstein at this
                    time. I thought it was a very bad time for me to be transferred. Furthermore, I
                    said that I knew nothing about personnel and that therefore if given my
                    preferences, I would rather return to Nigeria. But Bell insisted that he wanted
                    someone like me with field experience to head up the agency's personnel program.
                    He asked me to consider the proposal, which I did. Several days later, I sent
                    him a hand-written note in which I essentially took the same position, namely
                    that I felt I was committed to return to Lagos for another tour. I thanked him
                    for his confidence in me and expressed the hope that my decision would not
                    jeopardize my future in the organization. I left the note with Bell's secretary
                    and never heard another word.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I returned to Lagos believing that I might have blotted my career forever.
                    Sometime early in 1964, I received instructions to report to the National War
                    College in August, although that assignment would cut my tour in Lagos by one
                    year. So we left Lagos and my family and I went to Denver, Colorado for a
                    vacation. While there, I received a call from Bill Hall, then the Assistant
                    Administrator of AID for Administration. He said that he would be in Minneapolis
                    and asked that I fly out to meet him, which I did. So I left Joan and the two
                    sons in a wretched motel in Denver—the kids were at the scrapping age in a
                    constant battle and she had her hands full. But I went to meet Hall who said in
                    effect that he wanted to work out a deal with me. In exchange for a year at the
                    National War College, he wanted me to take on the Personnel Director's position
                    in 1965. The War College was seen as a reward for a good job in Nigeria and a
                    reward for taking the Personnel job. I agreed. Hall then said that I would have
                    to be approved by the White House and that required some interviews there with
                    Ken O'Donnell and Ralph Dungan. So I went back to Denver, picked up my family
                    and went to Washington to meet with Ralph Dungan.</p>
                <p>I had a good meeting with Dungan. He asked me where I wanted to be ten years
                    hence. I said that although I was in AID officer, my goal was to become an
                    ambassador, although I recognized all the bureaucratic hurdles that a non-State
                    Department official would have to face. Dungan wasn't at all fazed; he merely
                    said that time would tell. Ralph approved my appointment as Director of
                    Personnel and I went on to the War College.</p>
                <p>In retrospect it is obvious that Bell and Hall had never really taken my first
                    refusal to accept the Personnel position as final. I think the assignment to the
                    War College was just part of a career development process which they had decided
                    would lead eventually to my appointment as Director of Personnel. Wade Lathram,
                    who was at the time the Director of Personnel, was behind the plot. He wanted to
                    be sure that he had an agreed-upon successor so that he could leave Personnel in
                    1965. So for the first time in my career, I knew a year in advance what the
                    future held.</p>
                <p>As is the case in all executive training assignments, about half way through the
                    period, all the participants began to discuss their onward assignments. I was
                    one of the few, if not the only one, who could say that I already had my
                    assignment; that made AID look like the most efficient organization in the U.S.
                    government!</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Let me talk a little about the National War College experience, which I found to
                    be extraordinary. It was very rewarding, but might have been even more so had
                    the atmosphere been less permissive. Unlike most military organizations, the War
                    College seminar was loosely run. Very little was demanded of the students. You
                    did have to fulfill certain minimum requirements, but the requirement to do some
                    independent research was done rather haphazardly. Since I had personnel on my
                    mind, I decided to write a paper on the lack of talent at middle management
                    levels in most foreign government bureaucracies that I had observed. I had found
                    that problem in a good number of the ministries I had worked with, particularly
                    those dealing with technical and scientific issues. It occurred to me that
                    recruitment from the outside might well be one of the ways for these
                    organizations to improve their middle management skills. This could be done on
                    straight salary arrangements, with the funding perhaps coming from a donor
                    government. This scheme would have brought into these ministries, civil servants
                    recruited from outside the country—U.S. or Europe, for example—paid by the
                    employing government although the compensation might have to be somewhat higher
                    than comparable positions for local staff in order to permit the European or
                    American to live at a level more consistent with Western standards. I did some
                    research on the subject and found that in some incipient ways this practice had
                    already been in effect for some Norwegians, Swedes and the British, who had
                    their own citizens scattered throughout the world. I wrote a paper on this
                    subject, suggesting that such a program become part of the US assistance
                    program. I proposed, that instead of sending high priced technical advisors, the
                    donors just make money available for the direct employment of some skilled
                    middle managers. I thought this would be particularly useful institution where
                    the American advisor had no local counterpart because of the advanced nature of
                    the skills required. The paper was well received and it got good marks.</p>
                <p>Many of my colleagues worked perfunctorily on their research papers. The rigorous
                    pursuit of subject matter was not one of the course requirements and therefore
                    the research was spotty. But the year gave me some great opportunities. All the
                    officers assigned to the War College were sent there on the assumption that they
                    would subsequently rise to higher positions in their military services. About a
                    third of the class was civilians, mostly Foreign Service officers. There were
                    two AID staffers-Jim Howe and myself. There were two from CIA, and someone from
                    Commerce.</p>
                <p>It was a splendid year and a most welcomed respite after the long tiring days I
                    had spent in Nigeria. The change of pace was much appreciated. An added bonus
                    was our trip overseas. We were encouraged to select a part of the world which
                    was unfamiliar to us. I picked Latin America. The College put an Air Force
                    tanker plane at our disposal—not too comfortable, but very convenient. We
                    traveled to Panama, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. We spent most
                    of our time in the capitals of these countries. We stopped for three or four
                    days in each country. We saw the Presidents, the Prime Ministers and other
                    senior officials; we were briefed by the American country team members. It was
                    an impressive operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In Brazil, Lincoln Gordon was the Ambassador, Stuart Van Dyke was the AID
                    Director, Sam Lewis was one of the Ambassador's assistants and Dick Walters was
                    the military attach�. That was a first class mission. That trip afforded me my
                    first opportunity to get a feel for Latin America. We wrote a collective paper
                    which was really quite good. It discussed the politics and economics of the
                    countries visited, the role of the military in each, the relationships with the
                    US, the prognosis for the future, etc. Then one or two of us made a presentation
                    to the whole class on behalf of our group.</p>
                <p>Every War College Commandant at his opening speech to a new class invariably
                    requests each one in the audience to look to the person on his right and then to
                    the one on to his left. The Commandant then makes the comment that each student
                    may one day be in a position where he will depend on his neighbor for a vital
                    service. In my case, it did happen; that was when I was put in charge of the
                    Jordan Task Force. The general whom the Air Force assigned as a liaison with
                    State was in fact the officer who sat on my right at the Commandant's address.
                    By the time we met again, he had become a Lieutenant General. He and I
                    coordinated plans for the deployment of American troops from Germany to bases
                    near the Middle East to prevent the movement of Syrian armor into Jordan. The
                    Syrians were seeking to assist the Palestinians who were then trying to
                    overthrow King Hussein. So that was one War College encounter that paid off. My
                    friendships with two former ambassadors, Chris Van Hollen and Talcott Seelye go
                    back to War College days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any case, that was the last time you were able to get
                        back home by 6 o'clock because in 1965 you became Director of Personnel of
                        the Agency for International Development. We already know how you became so
                        blessed. Tell us a little about the job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: You are so right about getting home by 6 p.m. The War College was a great
                    experience because I had a chance to see my wife and sons in the evenings and on
                    weekends. Also the military were interested in nourishing both mind and body. So
                    in addition to the intellectual challenges, we participated in intramural
                    sports—softball, tennis. Our great rivals were the Industrial College of the
                    Armed Services teams who shared the same campus. We had a little World Series in
                    softball each year. The War College has an active alumni association, so that I
                    am periodically invited to meetings and get a chance to keep up to date.</p>
                <p>One of the major lessons I learned during the year was to be more tolerant and
                    understanding of the “military mind”. There are a lot of very able, sensitive,
                    cultured people in our services. There are, of course, some duds and some
                    limited officers, but as a group they earned my respect for their dedication and
                    hard work. There are a lot of myths in the civilian world about our uniformed
                    brethren.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you have previously mentioned, in 1965, you became
                        Director of Personnel of the Agency for International Development. In what
                        shape did you find that Office when you took it over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: By this time, the Office had been headed by a string of relatively short
                    termers. On the whole, these were people of some competence, but who hadn't
                    stayed long enough to leave their marks. The personnel process had been
                    disproportionately influenced by the regional bureaus which at the time, within
                    the AID structure, were more like independent fiefdoms. It was a great challenge
                    to the Personnel Director to try to reclaim the personnel function from the
                    Regional Offices. With the full blessing of David Bell, then AID Administrator,
                    and Bill Hall, my immediate boss, a State Department official whom Bell had
                    recruited to head AID's administrative efforts, I started to try to bring back
                    the personnel function into the Office of Personnel.</p>
                <p>First of all, I brought in some new talent. I employed a new chief of training
                    because I felt that area needed considerable improvement. His name was Warren
                    Ziegler. He had been in charge of the Peace Corps in the Eastern region of
                    Nigeria. He became a superb training director. I hired a new head of
                    recruitment, a function which had plagued the Agency for many years because it
                    had been done on a catch-as-catch-can basis. The Vietnam war was heating up
                    which increased the demands for AID personnel there as well as in the whole of
                    Asia. In general, one of my objectives was to increase the number of young
                    officers in the Agency. In fact, as I reflect on my stewardship of Personnel,
                    one of the programs that I am proudest of was in junior officer recruitment,
                    which brought young people from university and colleges campuses to the Agency.
                    We recruited about fifty of that caliber each year under this program called JOT
                    (Junior Officer Training).</p>
                <p>I also established a planning office which was headed by Jim Silverman, a
                    brilliant and somewhat quirky official, with lots of new ideas, many of them
                    sound. He was very creative and helpful shaping the future direction of the
                    Office of Personnel. I also emphasized the audio-visual aspects of training and
                    recruited a new man to spearhead this effort. He developed tapes, recordings,
                    etc. for the use of our training classrooms.</p>
                <p>The struggle with the regional bureaus was one of the highlights of my tenure. I
                    set up periodic meetings with each of the regional assistant administrators and
                    their executive officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>We also established a special office for recruiting executives to fill senior
                    positions in AID. We began a program which would permit us to consider how we
                    could meet the career needs of our personnel while at the same time meeting the
                    agency's needs. We tried to make some “advanced placements”, i.e. we “slotted”
                    personnel six to twelve months before they would actually be available for
                    reassignment. My days in Personnel were exciting; they required long hours. On
                    the whole, I found the experience quite satisfactory, although I did not stay as
                    long as I thought desirable. By the end of the second year, just as many of
                    these new projects were beginning to show some promise, I was asked by Bell and
                    Hall to become the AID Mission Director in Pakistan which at the time was one of
                    our largest programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that stage of your career, let me ask
                        you a couple of questions about Personnel. Many have said that one of the
                        genesis of AID's personnel problems was that it has always been viewed as a
                        “temporary” agency—one that is supposed to fade away at any moment. Did you
                        find that view to be an impediment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: It was not a critical problem. Indeed I did not find it an impediment at
                    all in our recruitment efforts, even when we were talking “careers” as we did
                    with the young officers that we brought in. The notion of “temporary agency” did
                    have a psychological effect because we were well aware that the Agency existed
                    from year to year at the sufferance of the Congress. But in fact the “temporary”
                    aspect of the agency's legal existence was not really a great problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the serious complicating factors in managing
                        personnel in an agency such as AID is the need for a great variety of
                        personnel. In addition to the central core of managers, administrators and
                        planners, that agency needed a large number of specialists. How did you meet
                        that problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>KONTOS: Recruitment had be very selective and careful. As this phenomenon became
                    more accentuated in later years, AID would increasingly use contractors. For
                    example, when I was in Nigeria we had a series of University contractors, many
                    of which consisted of 20-25 people each. So in part the problem of specialists
                    was ameliorated by the use of contract personnel. For employees who would become
                    members of the Agency, we tried to be very careful that they not only had
                    technical skills, but also were sufficiently flexible, tolerant, and resilient
                    to live in foreign and sometimes strange environments. But by the time I became
                    Director of Personnel, the Agency already had a cadre of technical people who
                    were careerists in their field of specialization. The appointment of each one of
                    these specialists required at least the approval of the head of the functional
                    office for whom the individual would work. We managed to work out a relationship
                    with these functional bureaus that worked quite well. That functional approval
                    was used for lawyers and economists as well people in agriculture, public
                    health, education, etc. The head of the Planning and Program Coordination Office
                    (PPC) was Gus Ranis who was very active in helping us to recruit economists and
                    ultimately to place them in appropriate vacancies. It was a collegial activity,
                    but I think it is fair to say that during my tenure in Personnel an increased
                    number of decisions on personnel assignments was made in the Personnel Office
                    than ever before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about relationships with other government
                        agencies? First, do you have any recollections about State Department and
                        its involvement in the AID personnel process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes. We had good relationships with State's personnel people. Ambassador
                    Joe Palmer, with whom I had worked previously in Nigeria, was then the Director
                    General. I served on one of his boards. I was able to recruit some Foreign
                    Service officers for service in AID. I felt then, and I still do, that such
                    interchanges between agencies, particularly State, AID and USIA, was a goal to
                    be sought and beneficial to all concerned.</p>
                <p>There was no pressure to bring our personnel operation under the jurisdiction of
                    State nor was there much discussion of a unified Foreign Service Act. We did
                    talk a little about the possibility of some day having a unified personnel
                    system in which the AID Foreign Service would be managed the same way as State's
                    Foreign Service. That occurred in part many years after my service as Director
                    of Personnel.</p>
                <p>The Peace Corps was no problem. On the contrary, many of our recruits were former
                    Peace Corps volunteers. One of them was a young woman who was recruited under
                    the Junior Officer Training Program and assigned to Pakistan about the same time
                    as I went as Mission Director. She is now the AID Mission Director in
                    Bangladesh; she has had a very good career in AID after being a Peace Corps
                    volunteer.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>While we are discussing relationships with other agencies, I should mention that
                    the White House would send us candidates from time to time for possible jobs in
                    AID. That was always a little bit ticklish because they usually came with the
                    support of their political party. In many cases, I had to fend off these
                    candidates because many of them were mediocre. I would usually interview them
                    myself and then I would also make sure that some senior agency officials would
                    see them. I don't recall any case when our negative judgment was over-ruled by
                    the White House, but these cases always presented a problem to the
                    bureaucracy.We also had a fair amount of pressure from Congressional sources.
                    From time to time, we would receive calls about certain constituents who were
                    looking for employment or about constituents who didn't feel that they had
                    received appropriate assignments. I think all of these matters were disposed of
                    in reasonably amicable fashion. My boss, Bill Hall, was very assiduous in this
                    regard. He didn't want any Congressman or any member of his or her staff
                    offended; we would lean over backwards to accommodate Congressional requests; I
                    think we managed to satisfy all inquiries without compromising on the caliber of
                    personnel that we were interested in maintaining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1967, you were assigned to Pakistan as Mission
                        Director. That was a large mission. What did you find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I found a mission that was regrouping after the second Indo-Pakistani
                    war. Three years earlier, the Pakistanis had their noses bloodied by the
                    Indians. The war period obviously affected the work of the Mission, but by the
                    time I arrived, its effects had pretty will dissipated and the Mission was
                    functioning normally again. The majority of the Mission itself was in Karachi,
                    although the government under the leadership of Ayub Khan had decided to move
                    the capital of Pakistan north to Islamabad. AID had a small office in Lahore in
                    the Punjab, which is closer to Islamabad. Before my arrival, the decision had
                    been made to move the Karachi staff to Lahore as a half-way house to Islamabad.
                    So we established temporary quarters in Lahore pending the renovation of an
                    appropriate building in Islamabad. So for a year, we worked out of Lahore, with
                    a small liaison office in Islamabad where the Embassy had moved. During this
                    first year, I spent a lot of time on an airplane shuttling back and forth
                    between Lahore and Islamabad. In those days, East Pakistan was still a part of
                    greater Pakistan, separated by India, requiring considerable plane travel to
                    that area. I did a lot of traveling that first year and a lot even in the
                    second.</p>
                <p>The year we spent in Lahore was very advantageous. Lahore had been the
                    traditional capital of Islamic India, when it was still part of the British
                    empire. The Pakistan establishment lived in Lahore. So while we were there, we
                    had excellent entre into the elite of Pakistan society. When we left Karachi, we
                    left a small office there, giving us a continuing access to the financial and
                    commercial sector of Pakistan society. Our new offices in Islamabad were very
                    close to the Chancery; that helped us to become more closely associated with the
                    Embassy and being in the capital, with the Pakistan government. So we developed
                    and maintained relationships with all the important segments of Pakistan
                    society.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The Ambassador was Benjamin Oehlert, Jr. who had been the CEO of Minute Maid, a
                    subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company and a friend of President Johnson's. He had
                    also been a lawyer. He had no understanding of foreign affairs, but had the wit
                    to recognize his deficiency and basically allowed his staff fairly free reign.
                    He was very good at ceremonial occasions; he traveled around the country. He saw
                    his role primarily as chairman of the board with the operations being conducted
                    by his staff. His DCM was Dave Schneider, a career officer, who was very good
                    with considerable experience and knowledge of the area.</p>
                <p>This was, however, a situation in which the Ambassador's wife played a
                    disproportionate role in the way the embassy was organized. The wife of the
                    economic counselor—a very ambitious woman—became very close to Mrs. Oehlert. To
                    put it bluntly, that woman wanted her husband to have a higher status in the
                    embassy. She told many stories to Mrs. Oehlert, which contributed to an unusual
                    and unprecedented change in staffing. The DCM was reassigned to Washington with
                    the economic counselor being appointed as DCM. These shifts had no effect on the
                    AID Mission, but I know the story well because I was consulted by all parties. I
                    told the Ambassador that he was making a serious mistake, to no avail. The
                    Consul General in Dacca was also removed on some frivolous decision by the
                    Ambassador. These actions created some havoc among the career people and were
                    the only legacy left by the Oehlerts.</p>
                <p>In fact, since none of this foolishness affected our operations, I was pleased to
                    have an Ambassador who gave us a free hand. In light of the size of our
                    assistance programs, my access to the President and his senior Cabinet officers
                    was excellent. Most of the Pakistanis who worked on the Planning Commission, the
                    Ministry of Finance, and some of the other ministries were very good and our
                    relationships were first class. Many of them are still playing important roles
                    in the Pakistani government today. Needless to say, all of them spoke excellent
                    English. Many had been trained in Pakistan in English schools; some were trained
                    in England and some in the United States (a number had graduated from Yale,
                    Princeton, Harvard and Berkeley). The older officials had been members of the
                    Indian Civil Service, which was a very distinguished group indeed. Pakistani
                    officials were a very capable group—articulate, knowledgeable, and well versed
                    in the bureaucratic quarters which required us to be on our toes at all
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal objectives of the assistance
                        program in Pakistan in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>KONTOS: One of the principal ones was to increase the food supply. During this
                    period, the so-called “green revolution” became the major innovation in South
                    Asia. The dwarf varieties of wheat and rice were being introduced on a
                    considerable scale into Pakistani agriculture. They had a great success. These
                    new varieties of wheat and rice seeds were a major breakthrough in agriculture
                    production. The two centers where the experimental work was done were Mexico
                    City and Los Banos in the Philippines. To foster the spread of these new grain
                    crops throughout Pakistan, we needed appropriate transport, fertilizer and other
                    necessary inputs. The AID Mission played an important role in minimizing the
                    government's control over fertilizer trade. We fought valiantly, and with some
                    success, with the government to free fertilizer from import duties, to develop a
                    loan program for Pakistani fertilizer plants, and to improve the distribution
                    flow by eliminating governmental controls and middle-men. The farmers accepted
                    the new seeds but with the usual concern about how they would grow in a
                    Pakistani environment. In general, the demonstration projects which clearly
                    indicated the strength and virility of the new seeds in Pakistan's climatic
                    conditions were sufficient to convince the farmers to use them. We brought these
                    new seeds at very reasonable costs, so that in fact the farmers obtained them at
                    subsidized costs. The government and the Mission worked very closely to support
                    the “green revolution”, including procurement of the seeds, water allocations
                    (the Punjab was heavily irrigated), and distribution of fertilizer. In promoting
                    what was an agricultural development project, we were very active at the same
                    time in fostering a freer market and an open economy. That was another major
                    objective of our program.</p>
                <p>We of course had other projects as well to achieve that goal. For example, we
                    helped set up a stock exchange in Karachi. We tried to sponsor some new banking
                    regulations which were more sensible than the existing ones. We were also
                    interested in the growth of Pakistani industry, which began to flourish while I
                    was there.</p>
                <p>Our public health program was largely focused on family planning. It was a major
                    aspect of our mission. In education, we had some modest projects, but it was not
                    as important as it was in Nigeria, where it was a central theme of our program.
                    We had a modest project in public administration. But our emphasis was really in
                    the creation of a free market. We had advisors to various financial
                    institutions, such as the stock exchange. In addition to our own economists,
                    there was a group of economists from Harvard, which at one time had been headed
                    by Dave Bell. They were working with the Pakistani Planning Commission and were
                    influential on such matters as a new investment code and the optimum use of
                    outside assistance. The AID Mission, along with its Pakistani counterparts and
                    other groups like Harvard, was deeply involved in the planning and execution of
                    an economic development program for the whole country. It was a heady
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Pakistan had a history of central control of its economy. The hand of the
                    government was found in many areas; the private sector flourished in certain
                    niche areas, light manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, equipment for hospitals,
                    and sports equipment. Wherever the heavy hand of government could be loosened,
                    there was a private sector response that was really heartening.</p>
                <p>We also had a major import program. For example, the government of Pakistan was
                    modernizing its rail system and we provided loans which permitted the
                    procurement of GM locomotives. We played an important role in the design,
                    construction and equipping of a large hydro-electric power system. So there were
                    a lot of activities in which we were involved. The aid level ranged between $250
                    to $275 million and the staff consisted of 162 U.S. direct hire and a sizeable
                    number of contract personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any efforts made to have our assistance meet
                        certain political goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The U.S. of course wanted to achieve amicable relations between India and
                    Pakistan and we tried to maintain a reasonably balanced military assistance
                    program to both countries. But, as I recall, our relationships with India became
                    much more strained and as we continued our considerably military assistance
                    program to Pakistan, the Indians shifted to procurement of Soviet military
                    hardware. Then the Pakistanis tended to look to us to maintain a balance of
                    forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can an assistance program influence such political matters
                        as an India-Pakistan relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes, in a variety of ways. We kept in close touch with our colleagues in
                    New Delhi. There were frequent visits back and forth. We encouraged discussions
                    between Indian and Pakistani officials that were of mutual interest to both
                    sides. The kind of military assistance that the U.S. provided was instrumental
                    in maintaining a military balance and stability between the two countries. It
                    was a delicate problem and we had to move with great caution. We never,
                    unfortunately, reached the stage when we could have joint U.S.-India-Pakistan
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about the internal politics of Pakistan
                        at this time and the impact they may have had on the nature of our
                        assistance programs or what impact our programs may have had on Pakistani
                        politics.</hi>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>KONTOS: One of the major issues of the day was the maintenance of the unity of
                    the country. There were signs even then of growing disenchantment in that part
                    of Pakistan now known as Bangladesh. We therefore took great care to make sure
                    that assistance efforts were proportionately distributed between East and West
                    Pakistan. I made frequent visits to East Pakistan—Dacca and other parts. There
                    were other tribal areas which were restive and we tried to make sure that our
                    assistance reinforced those elements that were in favor of a unified Pakistan.
                    We tried to make sure that the new country of Pakistan, formed out of a
                    partition of India, would succeed as one country.</p>
                <p>Pakistan was an important country to our global policies. The British had fought
                    for Afghanistan's independence to prevent further encroachment of the Russian
                    bear into Southeast Asia and access to the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. We
                    were not about to let that change. It is not difficult to judge that the size of
                    our assistance program was in large measure dictated by our political
                    objectives. The Pakistani needs were obvious. The size of the previous year's
                    program played an important role; it would have been difficult to deviate one
                    way or another from that. Indeed, when aid levels were below the previous year's
                    levels, many a government saw that as a sign of American displeasure or lack of
                    concern or interest for its well being. A number of factors went into setting
                    levels of assistance for Pakistan: the previous years' levels, the fact that it
                    was a country of 75-80 million people, located in a strategic place, and a
                    country that had used its assistance very usefully. In addition, I think we had
                    very persuasive arguments to support the levels of assistance that we requested.
                    I must admit that looking back on it, I can not say that the country allocation
                    was made in any coherent or rational or logical fashion. It was more a hit or
                    miss happenstance. I refer to the whole assistance levels determination process.
                    The setting of levels is a very arcane and esoteric business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a Peace Corps program in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: We did not, although we tried to start one from time to time. But the
                    Peace Corps was viewed in some quarters as the advance guard of American
                    intelligence and was suspect. So the Pakistanis were really never interested. We
                    did have a number of private volunteer agencies—e.g the Asia
                    Foundation—represented in Pakistan which, although small, were very
                    effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>That tour was one of my great experiences overseas. I look back on it with great
                    affection and even some nostalgia. I left before I think I should have. I was
                    there only two years; I think I should have been allowed another two years.
                    There were a variety reasons for my reassignment. For one, the deputy
                    administrator of the NESA Bureau wanted my job. Secondly, I had not established
                    the best of relationships with the head of the Bureau who had been my
                    predecessor in Pakistan. Everything that I did which deviated from what he had
                    done previously was seen as “not well thought through” or ill-advised. So I had
                    the classic problem of my predecessor being my boss which created a certain
                    amount of tension. The ostensible reason for my return was to establish a new
                    program evaluation system for AID. This was a management innovation strongly
                    backed by John Hannah, then the AID Administrator, and he was very interested in
                    getting it started. Until then AID did not have a formal evaluation process.
                    Hannah and others felt that this was a great deficiency and wanted it put in
                    place in a hurry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Hannah perceive the evaluation process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I was the first director of this new evaluation office. But Joel
                    Bernstein, my ex-boss from Nigeria, had already made an effort to get such a
                    system underway. In a reorganization of the Agency, Joel had been made the chief
                    of a new Technical Assistance Bureau and had recommended me to Dr. Hannah as his
                    successor in his old job. By the time I arrived in Washington, the new Office
                    and the process were just in their infancy. The objective of the process was to
                    learn from our extensive assistance experience around the world (We had programs
                    in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa. We had had experiences in
                    Europe). But nowhere was there a clearinghouse which could be the Agency's
                    memory from which lessons could be learned and mistakes avoided. Another
                    objective was to find projects that were not meeting their objectives so that
                    they could be terminated before more resources were wasted. When you begin with
                    an organization that has no capacity to review its on-going activities or to
                    learn from its past experiences, there was a formidable argument for an
                    evaluation process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an assumption that lessons learned in one
                        country might be applicable to projects in an other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>KONTOS: Absolutely. That view was prevalent. For example, we frequently had
                    people in an agriculture project run into problems that were quite similar to
                    those encountered by our technical people in another country. The remedies that
                    might have been developed in the second country certainly could have been
                    applicable to the first. This was true certainly at the micro-level, i.e. the
                    project level, when problems might have arisen with the indigenous bureaucracy
                    or the local farmer, but I think it may well be true for larger issues. While in
                    the evaluation job, we undertook surveys of key issues such as land reform—its
                    successes and failures. We explored the circumstances where it worked well and
                    where it had failed; we looked at the long term economic advantages of land
                    reform. So we garnered experiences that were relevant from one country to
                    another and which, if heeded, could have obviated a lot of differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does your view suggest that the cultural barriers to
                        economic development that many people perceive may not be as insurmountable
                        as they believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The cultural barriers do exist, but when you undertake activities that
                    require innovations, new ideas, new approaches in an environment of
                    traditionalism, our experiences have shown that, given palpable and clear
                    incentives, people do respond despite their cultural inheritances. It is usually
                    the same incentive: cash. It is remarkable the way farmers in a variety of
                    cultures respond to prices. Given a fair price for their products, they will
                    increase their production many fold. If, as many governments have done, they are
                    paid low and inadequate prices, production falls. There is a clear record of
                    that phenomenon in all kinds of farming situations.</p>
                <p>It is true that any economic development program runs into cultural barriers of
                    one sort or another. In Pakistan, for example, we encountered the firm popular
                    belief that government had all the answers. Tight government control was
                    therefore viewed as beneficial in the long run, which I consider a false
                    premise. Also, since we operated in an Islamic society, the role of women had to
                    be considered carefully. In many ways Islamic tendencies created inhibitions for
                    the use of women in a variety of fields. Pakistan had a high degree of
                    illiteracy; even today it approximates 75 or 80%. That makes economic
                    development difficult; people can not read simple instructions and follow them.
                    We also had regional tensions—Punjabis, Sindhis, Pathans, Baluchis—creating
                    internal problems. We faced difficult relationships between the Muslims who had
                    come from India and those who had lived in the area that became Pakistan for
                    many generations.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I never encountered in any of my assignments cultural barriers that could not be
                    overcome. Of course, I worked, with the exception of Greece and Lebanon,
                    essentially in countries that had been former British colonies: Ceylon, Nigeria,
                    Pakistan, and the Sudan. In each case, English was the second language so that
                    discourse with the government and the local elites was easy. These countries had
                    a legacy of relatively decent civil services, of reasonably good road systems,
                    of law and order that was more or less effective; these countries were born with
                    some fairly positive influences even though they all possessed different
                    cultures and histories.</p>
                <p>To go back to the evaluation process, I should describe how we established the
                    procedure. We first set some bench marks for evaluation purposes. We had to
                    begin the process of being able, in a fairly direct and fairly workable way, to
                    assess the successes and failures of ongoing projects. Once that was done, then
                    conclusions could be reached on the reasons for success. We had to establish a
                    formula and that took most of a year to devise. We developed a matrix which
                    enabled us to evaluate various assumptions that spawned and maintained the
                    project. Sometimes we found them wanting; the project may have been floundering
                    because the original assumptions has been faulty. We had the assistance of a
                    very talented contractor called “Practical Concept Inc”; we used them as our
                    stalking horse. The matrix for program evaluation that we developed is still
                    AID's basic tool today for project evaluation. We tested the matrix in a number
                    of field trips and conferences attended by the contractor and myself and some of
                    my staff. We met each week with representatives of the regional bureaus and
                    other interested parties. Out of the year's effort, we were able to develop a
                    working tool which was ultimately accepted and became a permanent part of the
                    AID program evaluation process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that once the evaluation process was well in
                        being it had an impact on the development of new projects? Were mission
                        directors sufficiently aware of the new evaluation process to take advantage
                        of its findings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I think they were. One of the immediate by-products was to help the
                    missions to develop objectives that were much more realistic and achievable. We
                    tried to build into the matrix a method to identify inputs necessary for a
                    project's success and to weight the quantitative outputs. The more we focused on
                    that, the more people became sensitive to the necessity of realistic project
                    planning that had well defined, achievable goals. Planners focused much more on
                    goals that were quantifiable. Project development became more realistic and
                    sharper because of the evaluation process.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The transfer of “lessons learned” from one mission to another was going to be the
                    function of a clearinghouse—a center for project documentation that we had
                    established to accompany the program evaluation process. We planned to place
                    these evaluations in a library from which they could be retrieved and
                    disseminated throughout the agency. That part of the program went much more
                    slowly than I hoped. However, it is still alive today and is a central feature
                    of AID. I happened to be in Rosslyn last year and saw the new impressive
                    facility that the agency has established which stemmed from the same idea that
                    was spawned twenty years ago; namely a depository for program and project
                    evaluations available for dissemination throughout the agency. Essentially, what
                    AID uses now is what we developed in that first year, including the matrix.</p>
                <p>There was a great deal of resistance to the notion of a program evaluation
                    process from the bureaucracy. In part, that came from the fact that it was a new
                    endeavor and it was not understood. It infringed on bureaucratic fiefdoms—on the
                    baronies of the bureaus. I reported, nominally at least, directly to the
                    Administrator, Dr. Hannah, and that was seen as a threat. The missions were
                    resentful because they saw the process as just more paperwork. It took a long
                    time before we persuaded them that the process could be useful to them but, in
                    the end, they recognized its utility and it is now an accepted practice. But it
                    was a long uphill process. One of the techniques that I used to overcome
                    bureaucratic resistance was that weekly meeting with the bureaus that I
                    mentioned earlier. I asked each bureau to identify a senior official as the
                    “program evaluation” officer. He would attend these meetings in that capacity.
                    One or two of the bureaus who took the initiative seriously assigned competent
                    officers full-time to this function; others worked on it only part time. The
                    weekly session was very important in establishing alliances with people who
                    would then keep their bureaus informed and would become proponents of our
                    efforts inside the regional bureaus. These were the key elements in Washington
                    because they were the links to the field and were the first recipients of the
                    raw information which had to be reviewed by their evaluation officers.</p>
                <p>Some of the evaluations were used by other agencies. We established close
                    relationships with the U.N. and the World Bank. One of my staff consulted with
                    the UNDP and the World Bank in their attempts to set up an evaluation program.
                    In some ways, we pioneered this effort among aid donor agencies. These
                    international agencies benefitted from our experiences.</p>
                <p>I should note that never during my time were these evaluations ever used by
                    Congress or any other part of the U.S. government as a justification to
                    terminate a project or program. Even the agency's auditors did not use them to
                    discharge their responsibilities. Of course, these were days before Inspector
                    Generals had been conceived. It did have some effect on the programming process
                    and technical assistance projects underwent a tougher scrutiny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you completed your assignment as chief of the
                        Program Evaluation process, were you able to draw any general conclusions
                        about the U.S. foreign assistance efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>KONTOS: On the whole, I drew negative conclusions. There was a lot of misdirected
                    energy. There was an unabashed sort of self-confidence on the part of the
                    architects of many of the aid projects and programs. They felt they knew how to
                    develop projects that were germane and relevant to the needs of the host
                    country. In fact, the results of many activities were shown to be illusory or
                    lacking realism. There were a number of failures stemming often—frequently with
                    projects in Africa—from an assumption that a particular project would have a
                    local counterpart who would work side-by-side with Americans. The counterparts
                    would learn on the job through their association with the Americans, learning
                    the techniques and the management methods required to make the project a
                    success. The premise further assumed that at the end of a finite period—be it
                    two, four, or six years—the Americans would phase out and the counterpart would
                    assume responsibility for the project. We ran into this fundamental
                    misperception over and over again. In fact, for many projects, no counterparts
                    were available or there may have been one or two when a dozen were required or,
                    if one or two were trained, their government would shift them around leaving the
                    project in the hands of neophytes at best or no one at worst. The plans that
                    assumed local government counterparts frequently failed because they were not
                    available. The project would be initiated, a building would be found for the
                    project, equipment brought in, only to find eventually that no one in the host
                    government could administer the project or use the equipment. It was a question
                    of reality; many of the American project sponsors did not have enough.</p>
                <p>There were also errors in concept because there were American advisors who
                    thought that a new American innovation could be grafted on to the local
                    bureaucratic structure or on to a foreign economy. The concept that the
                    assistance projects could become self-sustaining and would grow was in many
                    instances just plain wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a very interesting point. Are you suggesting that
                        in general it is much more difficult to transfer technical know-how than we
                        thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>KONTOS: Absolutely. In retrospect, I would say that our assistance program was
                    based on certain hypotheses and assumptions that were fallacious. Despite the
                    efforts of project and program evaluators to judge our successes and failures
                    and to disseminate these findings to the practitioners as widely as possible, we
                    continue to operate even today without having absorbed the lessons of the past,
                    which for the most part have been negative. We have had a lot of failures in the
                    technical assistance area. In the case of infrastructure development, we have
                    had a better record. We have built roads although they may not have been
                    maintained as well as we might have liked; we have built dams, hydroelectric
                    power stations, we build irrigation canals. In some cases, those have been well
                    done. The “white elephants” that we hear about are usually in countries which,
                    not necessarily with U.S. money but with international or private bank funds,
                    have established airlines or uneconomic industries that are capital intensive
                    and had no chance of success from the outset. Particularly in Africa, when
                    countries became independent, they all felt that unless they had a steel mill or
                    an airline, they would not be perceived as a sovereign nation. Fortunately, the
                    U.S. did not become involved in those ill-advised efforts. Our infrastructure
                    loans on the whole went to reasonably successful projects. It is in the
                    technical assistance area that we have fallen down.</p>
                <p>Technical assistance is an exceedingly complicated business and the more I think
                    about it, the more I find that our past approaches were based on fallacious
                    premises. The idea of sending American technicians with American equipment to
                    establish American-style laboratories or schools or research facilities has not
                    been successful for a number of reasons. In the first place, the appropriate
                    level of local technical skills required to man those installations was lacking
                    and could not be developed in the short run; secondly, the whole array of
                    maintenance, spare parts, and supply, which was assumed to be forever available
                    was frequently absent—for “the lack of a nail the battle was lost” syndrome. The
                    notorious lack of understanding about the importance of maintenance that one
                    encounters in the Third World was the death knell of a lot of projects.
                    Furthermore, we made compacts with American trained foreigners who could have
                    managed these projects well in an American environment. In the absence of spare
                    parts or a maintenance culture, which I mentioned earlier, they could not carry
                    on. Sometimes the problems faced were even larger: lack of transport, roads, and
                    other facilities, all of which are essential to project success, although not
                    necessarily part of the project, were available to them in the U.S. but not at
                    home. The project therefore lacked sustenance from the local environment.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Having said all that, I must add that I am not entirely pessimistic about these
                    countries acquiring and using modern technology well, but it will not happen
                    through our efforts to export western technology to them through the technical
                    assistance process. The Third World will progress first of all by developing
                    free markets and a private sector that can, by itself, sustain new initiatives
                    and that will be able to garner the resources necessary to build and manage an
                    agricultural research station or a modern education system or other laboratory
                    research capacities. This will happen in a natural accretion to the openness of
                    society and a flourishing private sector. We have, in a way, reinforced the role
                    of government by helping bureaucratic establishments use technical assistance as
                    further enhancement of their power, which in the end has proven to be an
                    artificial support of an existing local situation. I think that the development
                    process that will occur, as it did with the Far East countries we call “tigers”,
                    will be the result of a flourishing private sector. Also, to a certain extent,
                    the process will be assisted by a government and a bureaucracy that have a sense
                    of concern for the welfare of its people, i.e. a democratic process. I have been
                    struck by my overseas experience with technical assistance how frequently the
                    Americans seemed much more concerned with the welfare of the population than the
                    bureaucrats sitting in their offices in the capital city. It was frequently the
                    Americans who were out in the field trying to understand what the farmers really
                    wanted and what they needed; it was also too frequent that these Americans were
                    unable to persuade or pry the bureaucrats from behind their desks to see the
                    real world. There was almost a sense of arrogance or overweening superiority
                    when these functionaries had to deal with their own people. The Americans had a
                    certain compassion, a certain sense of the needs of the general population
                    whereas the bureaucratic cadre in the capital were indifferent. That may sound
                    like a grand generalization, but I certainly reached it from my own
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know where we are today in our technical assistance
                        concepts? Has AID pretty much abandoned technical assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KONTOS: I don't really know. I do know that the trend that AID started in my days
                    of using contractors has certainly increased. The reasons for this switch from
                    direct hire to contractors is very complicated. One of the initial motivations
                    to move in that direction was that the Bureau of the Budget imposed a very tight
                    employment ceiling on the agency. To use the contract route was one way to avoid
                    the ceiling; that was certainly one of the original reasons for moving to an
                    increasing use of contractual personnel. We also had recruitment problems, but
                    contracting out the tasks was not much help. Universities, by and large, did not
                    use their own faculty for these contracts; they went out into the same markets
                    to recruit that the assistance agencies were using, unless there happened to be
                    a faculty member the University wanted to get rid of for a period of time.
                    Essentially, what would happen is that the University contractor would enter the
                    same recruitment market as did the agency. In addition, we were subject to
                    pressures from land grant colleges, which had an association headquarters in
                    Washington, and was a powerful lobby. Dr. Hannah came from one of the stellar
                    land grant colleges: Michigan State University. Furthermore, the agency came to
                    the conclusion that the direct employment of technical personnel was not a good
                    idea and that the contractual route was a far preferred managerial technique.
                    This meant that the permanent staff consisted largely of program planners,
                    managers, and administrative people—the core of the agency. The employment of
                    technical personnel was left largely to contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me return to the program evaluation process. By the
                        time you left it in 1972, did you feel that you were beginning to make an
                        impact? KONTOS: I don't think that our findings were yet making an impact. I
                        think there was finally a grudging realization that we couldn't use all the
                        resources that had been given us without establishing some bench-mark to
                        judge success and failure or without having some kind of post-project
                        evaluation. That much people came to accept. The large struggle was to
                        develop a simple, manageable, and yet revealing instrument that would allow
                        managers to move with some degree of insight. But in my time, program
                        evaluation did little to shape projects, except, as I mentioned earlier, to
                        make them a little more realistic in their design.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I should add that in the middle of my tenure as Director for Program Evaluation,
                    I was asked by the Department of State to take on an emergency assignment. The
                    Nigerian war was just coming to an end. State had decided that in order to deal
                    with the special problems resulting from the post civil war confusion, it would
                    establish a new office for Nigerian affairs, which would encompass the
                    political, economic, consular, relief, and assistance functions, all under one
                    director. This was unprecedented because never had all the Washington
                    responsibilities for these activities been put under the direction of one
                    official. They asked Dr. Hannah and Rudd Poats, who was the Deputy Administrator
                    at the time, for my services. With a certain reluctance, they agreed to let me
                    go to work for David Newsom, who was the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    African Affairs. The assignment was to be temporary until the post civil war
                    phase in Nigeria had ended and the situation in the country had stabilized. The
                    assumption was that it would be a one-two year assignment, at most.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I was given the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary. My principal deputy was a
                    Foreign Service officer; the other deputy was an AID officer. The Office of
                    Nigerian Affairs was staffed by eight or ten people, two or three of whom worked
                    on relief matters. It was an interesting experience. I had served in Nigeria and
                    had maintained some currency on the issues. I visited the country on a couple of
                    occasions while directing this Office. Bill Trueheart was the Ambassador and
                    Mike Adler was the AID Mission director. Joe Palmer, who was then Director
                    General, but had been Ambassador to Nigeria, served as an advisor to Newsom. It
                    was a most successful effort. Nigeria had become a major American domestic
                    political issue between those who supported the rebels and the those who
                    supported the regime in power during the civil war. The Department was at odds
                    with the NSC and the White House because we wanted to support the government in
                    Lagos without being antagonistic to the rebels in Biafra. We felt that the
                    legitimate government was in Lagos; we were accredited to that government. But
                    there were a lot of people, including, I was told, Mrs. Nixon who were extremely
                    partial to the Biafra cause. Mrs. Nixon became involved because she had become
                    concerned about human rights violations against the Biafrans.</p>
                <p>The Biafrans were for the most part Ibos, who were probably one of the most
                    sophisticated tribe on the continent of Africa. They were the most widely
                    traveled and therefore had the widest range of contacts in the West. With the
                    help of their friends in Switzerland, France and Germany, the Ibos mounted a
                    very successful public relations campaign, which showed starving Biafrans and
                    other examples of the evil intentions of the government in Lagos. There were
                    poignant posters in London, Paris, and other major European capitals showing a
                    starving Biafra baby. The Nigerian government was accused of impeding the
                    delivery of food stuffs, handled by private relief and governmental agencies, to
                    Biafra. To an extent this was true since Lagos felt that the relief supplies
                    included war materiel, which would be used against them. Lagos also considered
                    food as a military weapon and engendered great internal debate whether it should
                    be permitted to be delivered at all. France almost openly was supporting Biafra
                    as was the Catholic Church whose constituency was primarily in Biafra. That made
                    Nigeria an extremely volatile political situation and created great controversy
                    here in the United States. I remember that the NSC staff man handling Nigeria
                    was Roger Morris, a young FSO on detail to Henry Kissinger's staff. Roger was
                    probably in his late twenties or early thirties. On at least one occasion,
                    Palmer, a very senior and experienced diplomat, was harshly berated by Morris
                    because we favored Lagos too much and were not sufficiently pro-Biafra.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The basic reason for the establishment of the unique Office for Nigerian Affairs
                    was this bitter political struggle that was raging in the United States. We
                    started essentially as a program of humanitarian relief. There was great anxiety
                    about the possibility of a major famine in Biafra. That might have happened if
                    the Nigerian government had decided to be punitive toward the rebels, but in
                    fact, Lagos was extremely helpful and assisted in expediting the delivery of
                    foodstuffs. The alarm about massive starvation was premature; it did not happen,
                    although we were constantly under pressure to reassure all concerned that there
                    was no famine. A number of non-governmental agencies sent out a continual stream
                    of observers, who would return with dire stories of whole villages and regions
                    outside the distribution system, blaming the U.S. government for failing to
                    deliver supplies to these areas. That pressure was a very important factor in
                    the beginning. Later on, we spent much time seeking to calm the Nigerians who
                    were always suspicious of what they felt was a less than fully supportive
                    position because the State Department clearly was at odds with the NSC on this
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Nigeria was sui generis; it was not part of the Cold War. We wanted to make sure
                    that Nigeria, the largest and most populous country in Africa, would stay
                    united. Had the Biafrans succeeded in the civil war, it might have become a
                    model for other African minorities or irredentists who aspired to be
                    self-governing. There was concern that if Nigeria broke up, it might be the
                    beginning of a series of such events throughout Africa. Therefore, we wanted
                    Nigeria to remain united. Biafra was fighting for independence from the rule of
                    the Yorubas and the Muslims of the North. The NSC, on the other hand, was
                    motivated by sentimental and humanitarian reasons. Both the President and Mrs.
                    Nixon were somehow sympathetic to the Biafra cause. I don't think it was
                    question of realpolitik in this case as much as the President's sentimental
                    inclinations.</p>
                <p>The Biafrans, had they achieved independence, would have controlled most of
                    Nigeria's oil reserves. That suggests that there might have been some ulterior
                    motive behind Biafra's supporters like the French besides the religious one. The
                    issue was debated in the United Nations, but that was not a major factor during
                    my tenure as Office Director, which lasted about eighteen months. The debate was
                    mostly about the adequacy of the relief efforts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your eighteen months tour as Director of Nigerian
                        Affairs, what happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I returned to AID to my old job as Director of the Program Evaluation
                    Office. I had a good deputy, so that by the time I returned, the process had
                    evolved well. I, of course, had kept in contact with him while working on
                    Nigerian affairs and was therefore not out of touch. The deputy and the staff
                    had done a superb job and the first year's cycle of evaluations had been
                    completed quite adequately. I stayed on as Director until 1972.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I had visited Paris in the Fall of 1971 for a conference. While there, I met with
                    Stuart Van Dyke who was the U.S. Representative to the Development Assistance
                    Committee (DAC) at the time. While I was sitting in his office, he received a
                    call from someone in Washington wondering where I might be reached. So Stuart
                    handed me the phone; the person at the other end was a senior AID official
                    wanting to know if I would be agreeable to having the State Department put my
                    name on a list for a senior UN position. In response to my question, the job was
                    the Deputy Commissioner for the United Nations Relief Works Administration
                    (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees, which was headquartered in Beirut. I told the
                    caller that I would be back in Washington in two days, and I would be glad to
                    discuss the matter at that time. But Washington had to know right away; so I
                    said that it was OK to put my name on the list, but that I needed a lot more
                    information before I could really agree.</p>
                <p>That was the first time I had heard about UNRWA. I found out later that the UNRWA
                    Liaison officer in New York, a Dutch national, had worked with Bill Hall at Lake
                    Success when the UN was being founded under Trygve Lie—they had first worked in
                    London then at Lake Success on setting up the UN. Jan Van Wyck, the UNRWA
                    official, knew Bill Hall and had called him when the decision had been reached
                    that an American should fill the Deputy position. A Britisher held the
                    Commissioner General's job. Before this time, it had been the American that held
                    the top job and the Briton the deputy position. Hall was then the State
                    Department's Director General. UNRWA described the qualifications it was looking
                    for and Bill Hall mentioned my name. Van Wyck checked it out with Beirut and got
                    the green light to interview me. Bill then had one of his deputies call me in
                    Paris, so that by the time the call was made, UNRWA already knew something about
                    me. Soon after I returned to Washington, I was sent to New York to meet the new
                    UNRWA Commissioner General, Sir John Rennie, who had been the deputy. He was a
                    rather quiet Scotsman with long experience in the Colonial Office. He had been
                    Governor of Mauritius and then appointed to be the deputy in UNRWA. We hit it
                    off quite well; I heard later that other Americans were interviewed, but
                    apparently Rennie thought my background and my State Department support put me
                    at the head of the list. I agreed to take the job; I would be seconded to UNRWA
                    from the Foreign Service. The American who preceded me, but as Commissioner
                    General, had been an Under Secretary at the U.N. and was therefore part of the
                    international civil service corps. Henry Labouisse had been the head of UNRWA
                    before he became U.S. Ambassador to Greece. I was the first career Foreign
                    Service officer to join the UNRWA leadership. I thought that if it were
                    interesting, I would continue to work for UNRWA; if it did not work out, I could
                    always return to the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>Joan and I arrived in Beirut early in 1972. We ran into a new experience. UNRWA's
                    functions were to provide education, health, and some food to Palestinians who
                    had been made refugees as result of the establishment of Israel; they lived in
                    camps. The role of the UN and this agency, which was established in 1948, was to
                    keep these people going pending some kind of political resolution of their
                    status as refugees. It is important to stress that UNRWA did not run the camps;
                    it provided services, principally education and public health, and to a
                    diminishing degree, food for those in need. As Palestinians became more
                    self-sufficient, even as camp residents, supply of food became less and less
                    important and, in the end, was provided only for the very poor and pregnant
                    women or mothers with new babies.</p>
                <p>The camps were run by the host government where the camps were located. Camps
                    were in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, on the West Bank, and in Gaza. The host
                    governments, including the Israeli military authorities for the West Bank and
                    Gaza, were responsible for security in the camps. The camps had their own
                    internal arrangements, their own leaders and their own ways of administrating
                    day-to-day camp activities. Our public health efforts included not only the
                    running of clinics, but also the management of sewer and water
                    facilities—sanitation services of all sorts. UNRWA paid the nurses, the doctors,
                    etc. UNRWA also ran the schools, whose teachers were employees of UNRWA. Harry
                    Labouisse, when Commissioner General, started a few vocational education
                    training schools and later some secondary schools that went through the junior
                    high school level were established. As the Palestinian population grew—rapidly,
                    I might add—the number of teachers had to be increased, adding to the problems
                    of an already over-burdened agency.</p>
                <p>The staff which manned UNRWA headquarters was based in Beirut and consisted of a
                    small number of international civil servants. In addition to the forty or fifty
                    international staff at the headquarters and in the local offices, we had well
                    over ten to fifteen thousand Palestinians working for us—teachers, doctors,
                    nurses, sanitation workers, administrators, etc. In each country, we had an
                    international director. We had a Swede in Damascus, a Briton in Amman, a New
                    Zealander in Jerusalem and an American in Gaza. They had international deputies,
                    but the rest of their staffs were all Palestinians. The small headquarters staff
                    in Beirut was comprised of the Commissioner General, a deputy and a small
                    secretariat; then there was an official in charge of food distribution (a Brit),
                    one in charge of education (an Afghan, who had been the deputy minister for
                    education in Kabul) and one in charge of public health (a Pakistani). The
                    General Counsel was British as was the officer in charge of public relations and
                    fund raising. There were also heads of Transport, Refugee Registration, a
                    Controller and a person in charge of Administration. These people had been
                    recruited by the Agency without reference to their nationalities. There were no
                    “quotas” although the Commissioner General did try to maintain some balance
                    between the West and the Third World. A key man in headquarters was the
                    Controller who put together the budget and handled finances. He was the linchpin
                    in the chain; he was an American and very, very good.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The Agency's existence depended on voluntary contributions from UN member
                    countries. There were no financial quotas for UNRWA from member countries. The
                    U.S., the British, other European countries and later the EEC were major
                    contributors with the U.S. providing the lion's share. The Arabs were at first
                    very reluctant to give anything to UNRWA because they considered the
                    Palestinians refugees to have been created by the establishment of Israel and
                    hence not their responsibility. They held the West accountable for the situation
                    and therefore expected the U.S. and Europe to provide the necessary resources.
                    So it was always a difficult uphill battle to keep the operation solvent. The
                    Controller had to manage the very meager resources to insure that every cent was
                    well spent. As we approached each budget year, we projected a deficit, but
                    somehow the Agency was kept alive by last minute stipends. Sir John Rennie, the
                    Commissioner General, who has become a close friend, and I worked very amiably.
                    He stayed on after my departure until he retired four years later. He was
                    extremely active in getting new sources of money. He finally convinced the Arabs
                    that they had to contribute because UNRWA gave the Palestinians the most
                    important, and perhaps their sole, opportunity for education in the Arabic
                    language; furthermore, Palestinians' well being depended on UNRWA's ability to
                    deliver services. This argument, which I thought was persuasive, finally had its
                    intended effect on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and some of the other Arab countries
                    that provided some resources, although rather modest ones. The big breakthrough
                    was with the EEC which, as an independent entity, began to provide several
                    million dollars worth of foodstuffs as starters—mostly wheat and flour, rice and
                    butter. Later on, the EEC provide cash. All was the result of John's efforts
                    with the EEC. The U.S. maintained its level of support, increasing it modestly
                    over the years. But in general, it was a very difficult problem to get enough
                    money to keep the Agency alive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1948, when UNRWA was established, what was the
                        termination target for this “temporary” agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: First of all, the resettlement and/or compensation for all Palestinian
                    refugees was its objective. It was hoped that some would return to Israel and
                    that the others would be compensated for their loss of land and houses. Some
                    political solution had to be found to accommodate these refugees. Pending that
                    day, they would be under UNRWA support system. The refugees came from all parts
                    of what had been called Palestine—under a British mandate. The UN declared a
                    partition, which was rejected by the Arabs. A war ensued and Israel was
                    successful in keeping two-thirds of Palestine. During this time, there was a
                    great exodus of refugees into neighboring counties—Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
                    The people living on the West Bank of the Jordan River became residents of
                    Jordan. Those in Gaza were under Egyptian control until 1967 when, as a
                    consequence of another war, Israel took control of East Jerusalem, the West Bank
                    and Gaza. That brought the Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza under the
                    occupation of Israeli military forces.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort made to settle the refugees in
                        permanent habitats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes, there were some attempts, but the Palestinians felt that anything
                    short of complete return to the pre-1947 situation was unacceptable. You have to
                    understand that in some cases, the Palestinians had left their homes with the
                    keys still in the door locks because they felt that they would return in 48
                    hours. So they refused any notion of permanent settlement; that was an anathema.
                    They wanted to return to their homes and to their ancestral lands. Therefore,
                    any proposals for resettlement were rejected both by the refugees and by Arab
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did a refugee camp look like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: It varied. Some were near cities, such as Amman. As Amman grew, it
                    absorbed these camps. Some camps consisted of cement block houses, crowded, with
                    narrow streets and open sewers—fetid, damp for the most part. The houses were
                    heated by charcoal and kerosene. Some had fences around them, some did not. Most
                    of them just became part of the landscape—essentially ghettos. UNRWA had
                    registered each refugee and had elaborate records on all the refugees thereby
                    keeping the resident population from using UNRWA services. There was also a
                    certain amount of internal policing by the refugees which also minimized any
                    potential fraud or abuse of UNRWA services. The schools, for example, were
                    already crowded and the refugees had no interest in letting other children use
                    those facilities. There was probably very little incentive for non-refugees to
                    attend those schools in any case because they were not that great. They were
                    certainly no better than the local schools, although the way UNRWA recruited and
                    trained teachers was in many cases better than the system used by the local
                    school administration. All teachers and public health workers were Palestinians;
                    they were highly motivated and for the most part well educated. In the annual
                    examination given to all students at certain grade levels in that part of the
                    Arab world, the kids from the UNRWA schools received higher scores than their
                    local counterparts. The UNRWA teachers were better and that showed up in these
                    standardized tests. The teachers followed the local curricula and agenda as
                    dictated by the host Ministry of Education.</p>
                <p>On the public health side, the refugees' services may have been marginally better
                    than those received by the local population. The services were rendered by
                    clinics which to a certain extent included extra programs on such matters as
                    nutrition and other preventive public health efforts. That may have made the
                    UNRWA clinics somewhat better than local facilities. But you have to remember
                    that the Palestinians did not have any hospitals and if they were seriously ill,
                    had to go to a local government hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about political issues. Did UNRWA have any
                        difficulties with local governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes, indeed. We had lots of problems. Each government presented us with
                    different problems. Lebanon, for example, insisted that its military
                    intelligence service be the representative of the government in the camps. These
                    guys tended to be rough and treated the Palestinians badly. They were arrogant
                    and difficult and in some cases even abusive. Before I got to Beirut, the
                    Commissioner General was able to negotiate the departure of these intelligence
                    soldiers from the camps, which permitted the control of the camps to be
                    exercised by the Palestinians themselves with some kind of oversight by
                    UNRWA.</p>
                <p>Each government had sovereign jurisdiction over the camps. Any violation of local
                    law or criminal activity came under the jurisdiction of the host government. So
                    we had to deal with three levels of government: the local jurisdiction, the host
                    government at a national level and the UN. And then there were informal
                    Palestinian organizations who got involved. The UN relationship was very loose.
                    The Commissioner General was nominally an appointee of the Secretary General,
                    but he received no funds from the New York Secretariat. During the latter part
                    of my tenure, however, we were able to negotiate a deal with the UN Secretariat
                    for it to pick up the salaries of the international civil servants which
                    relieved UNRWA from a significant expenditure. Up to that time, the voluntary
                    contributions had paid for those salaries. After that successful negotiation, it
                    was the UN budget that bore the salaries of the international civil
                    servants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us something of the problems that you faced, like, I
                        assume the demand for a continuing increasing level of services.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: That was certainly one of the continuing demands. It was especially true
                    for schools which were always crowded, most of them running double shifts
                    because there weren't enough facilities to accommodate all the children and, in
                    light of our budget constraints, we couldn't build more schools. So we had to
                    run two shifts—morning and afternoon. The Palestinian children were taught in
                    UNRWA schools through junior high. Then they either entered the local senior
                    high school or went to work in the local economy, although this was difficult
                    because as in the case of Lebanon, work permits were required and were hard for
                    Palestinians to obtain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your tour, was there any effort to reevaluate the
                        basic tenet that the refugees would eventually be resettled?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>KONTOS: When UNRWA was established its charter contained a call for an ultimate
                    solution to the Palestinian problem, either through resettlement or compensation
                    or combination of the two. This thesis was reinforced by a number of UN
                    resolutions that called for the same solutions. These resolutions are the
                    mandates of the world community. The Palestinian desire for a homeland and for
                    recognition of their identity is so strong that the basic tenet did not change
                    and has not to this day. In fact, these Palestinian desires may have intensified
                    in the years since I left UNRWA even though the Palestinians have spread ever
                    more widely throughout the Middle East and elsewhere. I think that they have
                    become much more realistic about their prospects of returning to their former
                    homes and resuming their former lives on their former lands. They realize that
                    there is little prospect of the realization of that dream. They recognize that
                    Israel will remain as an entity with the support of the United States; that it
                    is militarily invulnerable. Therefore they are belatedly conceding now that
                    certain facts exist and that they will have to settle for half a loaf—the West
                    bank and Gaza— in some kind of arrangement agreed to by the Israelis. As many
                    observers have noted, the Middle East has seen a series of lost opportunities.
                    Palestinian realism is a recent phenomenon, although their desire for a national
                    identity has strengthened over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on your experience, was the segregation of the
                        Palestinians into camps a good idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The camps were a necessity because the Palestinians were refugees who had
                    to be sustained. The Quakers were the first to feed these people; UNRWA took
                    over from the Quakers. The UN was faced with a dilemma: what to do with people
                    who had moved into camps outside of what is now known as the “Green Line” —the
                    dividing line of pre-1967 Israel. So the camps already existed when UNRWA was
                    established; they had been erected by the Palestinians themselves when they
                    became refugees. The camps just grew up as a consequence of the refugee
                    emigration following the 1947 partition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were efforts made to bring permanent improvement to the
                        Palestinians' lives? Did they succeed? If not, why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Efforts were made, but they couldn't be directly attributed to UNRWA's
                    programs. Certainly some were able, by getting jobs and becoming
                    self-sustaining, to enlarge their one-room concrete huts and turn them into
                    two-story houses. Some Palestinians were able to improve their standard of
                    living by participating in a growing local economy. There was some support for
                    small entrepreneurs—small shops and services—but that all came from the
                    Palestinian community itself. UNRWA's mandate was limited to providing certain
                    services: education, public health and food. We didn't have any money to expand
                    our efforts, even if we wanted to do so. We barely had sufficient funds to keep
                    the continuing programs going. Each year, as the number of students increased,
                    we had to hire more teachers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Arab states that might have contributed financial
                        resources did not see the refugees as a threat to their own stability?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: No, they did not see the refugees as a threat. Among the host
                    governments, however, one did see the Palestinians as a potential threat and
                    that was Lebanon. It was greatly concerned that this large minority of displaced
                    persons, mostly Muslims, would change the balance of power in Lebanon and add a
                    whole new disproportionate number of Muslims to the society. The Gulf States
                    certainly did not perceive any threat; they in fact saw the Palestinians as
                    people deprived of their lands and property and as fellow Arabs whose grievances
                    had to be addressed. Kuwait imported Palestinians by the thousands for jobs in
                    the government, in the professions and in the economy in general. The
                    Palestinian diaspora spread them throughout the world. Because they are
                    entrepreneurial and have an exile's motivation, they have become the best
                    educated and organized Arab group in the world. The result has been a great
                    desire for a national flag, a seat in the UN—a place in the political
                    spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in UNRWA when the 1973 war broke out. What
                        problems did that create for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I happened to be on leave when it broke out. I got word that hostilities
                    had begun during consultations in New York on my way back to Beirut. So I had to
                    return alone, leaving Joan in the U.S. We had some problems, but the war didn't
                    really affect UNRWA's operational role. It was no threat to me personally. We
                    did note however starting in late 1973, a growing militancy among the
                    Palestinians in Lebanon. Ultimately this resulted in clashes with the Lebanese
                    army. We lived in Baabda, a suburb of Beirut, which overlooked the city. During
                    the fighting between the Palestinians and the Lebanese army, we could see from
                    our balcony tracer bullets flying through the sky. There were some aerial
                    bombardments of the camps by the Lebanese, a curfew was instituted, but despite
                    that and the violence, I was able to reach the office, although only at certain
                    hours. I flew the UN flag on my car which also had a UN license plate.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The only time I got into any kind of personal difficulty was when, as I
                    approached the main route in my private car, I saw that in one of the
                    neighborhood Palestinian camp some tires had been piled up and lit, blocking the
                    main route; so I decided—foolishly—to take what I thought was a shortcut. I
                    ended up in a dead-end in a very dangerous part of town. I started to back up
                    when I saw two young guys with machine guns running towards me shouting at me in
                    Arabic, presumably asking me what I was doing there. They kept their guns
                    pointed at me. This was during a period when a number of incidents had occurred
                    with UN personnel and foreign journalists taken hostage. They would usually be
                    held for 48 hours and then released; it wasn't anything like the way it became
                    ultimately. I felt sure, when the two guys approached me, that I would be in
                    trouble for a few days. I pointed to the car's license plate and kept repeating
                    “UNRWA, UNRWA”. They finally seemed to understand and indicated to me to leave
                    there in a hurry, which I surely did. That was the closest I came to be taken
                    hostage. I think this was some indication of the good reputation that UNRWA
                    enjoyed among the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>I should add that I had a UN Laissez Passer—a red UN passport—that allowed me to
                    travel across all sorts of borders, which other Americans couldn't do. I
                    traveled frequently to Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza; I crossed into
                    Israel from Southern Lebanon; I went into the West Bank from Jordan. My
                    international status eliminated any frontier barriers; I crossed borders without
                    any difficulties. UNRWA had a daily shuttle, driven by two Swedes, going through
                    southern Lebanon to Jerusalem, to Tel Aviv to Gaza and to the West Bank and
                    returning to Beirut the next day. That was a very useful way to get around. I
                    also had an UNRWA car with an Arab-speaking driver at my disposal which helped
                    me get around. So I traveled rather widely through the Middle East, being
                    introduced for the first time to the problems of the region and its cast of
                    characters. It was an extraordinary experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That now brings us into 1974, at which time you returned
                        to Washington for an assignment to the Secretary's Policy Planning Staff.
                        How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>KONTOS: That was interesting. While I was assigned to UNRWA, I came back to
                    Washington on consultation and ran into an old colleague of mine from the
                    National War College who was then on the Policy Planning Staff. He asked me what
                    I was doing, then he said that the Staff needed someone with my background
                    because it was undergoing some reorganization and restaffing as the result of
                    Henry Kissinger's recent appointment as Secretary of State. Kissinger had
                    brought with him from the NSC Winston Lord and had made him head of the Policy
                    Planning Staff. My friend arranged that I meet with Lord that same afternoon. We
                    had about an hour's discussion; he mentioned that he had a vacancy in a position
                    which was intended to do two things: a) to track U.S. assistance programs and
                    economic development in general and b) to watch developments in the U.N. Since I
                    had a background in both areas, Lord thought I might fit in well. I told him
                    that I would be interested in being considered, but that I needed to think about
                    it. Lord said that he also needed to consult the Secretary and that he would let
                    me know. He suggested that before leaving, I also talk to Brandon Grove who was
                    at the time one of his deputies.</p>
                <p>So I returned to Beirut the following day and resumed my activities. I had
                    finished two years and had expected to remain for another year or two. In fact,
                    there was a prospect that when Rennie was to retire in a couple of years, I
                    would succeed him as Commissioner General, which would have been a substantial
                    promotion. Soon after I returned to Beirut, Rennie left for Scandinavia for one
                    of his periodical fund raising expeditions. He was in Stockholm when I received
                    a cable from the Department assigning me to the Policy Planning Staff and
                    thereby terminating my assignment to UNRWA. There was, of course, no time for me
                    to have sent Lord my considered views. I could have resigned from the Foreign
                    Service and stayed on as a full international civil servant, but I decided that,
                    although UNRWA was very interesting and that staying on for another year or two
                    might have been advantageous—particularly from the point of view of learning
                    more about the intricacies of Middle East politics—in fact, UNRWA had a very
                    limited future. It had financial difficulties with annual budgetary crises, it
                    was an organization continually under pressure because it could not do what it
                    really wanted to do or what was really needed—further easing the plight of the
                    refugees—and then there was the psychological depression that we all felt
                    stemming from dealing with the miseries of the camps day in and day out and from
                    the frustrations of trying to do more than one really could. Furthermore, Joan
                    was not very happy in Beirut; there wasn't much for her to do, although she did
                    travel with me on my trips. All of those factors led me to decide to return to
                    Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>So we came back and I went to work for Winston Lord in S/P. I spent two years
                    there. It was extremely interesting. For the first time, I was in a job at the
                    policy planning level in the Department. I attended occasional meetings with
                    Secretary Kissinger. I came to admire and respect Lord's abilities and
                    competence. We had a very good staff, many of whom became Ambassadors and other
                    senior officials: Mike Armacost, Sam Lewis, Brandon Grove, Reg Bartholomew, Don
                    Petterson, Luigi Einaudi (now our Ambassador to the OAS), etc. It was a very
                    good group of individuals working in a collegial manner. We were involved in all
                    sorts of issues, stemming in part from Winston Lord's close relationship to the
                    Secretary that made us very much part of the policy development process—to the
                    extent that Henry Kissinger allowed anyone to share that process with him. My
                    particular assignments were fairly active during the 1974-76 period.</p>
                <p>One of the more important elements of my tenure was, at the behest of the
                    Secretary, to set up joint scientific-cultural-economic-political commissions
                    and exchanges with a number of countries. Kissinger had the idea that we should
                    extend ourselves to the maximum extent possible in involving the various
                    branches of our government with those of its counterparts in another one. He
                    reached the conclusion that joint commissions should be established with a
                    number of key countries and that under the umbrella of these commissions
                    linkages between bureaucracies would be established covering a wide range of
                    activities. These commissions were initially established with India, Morocco,
                    Indonesia, Pakistan, Israel, Saudi Arabia—which as I will mention later became a
                    major enterprise. I was charged by Lord to do the initial planning to set up the
                    modalities for these commissions—who would represent whom, at what levels, who
                    would take the lead. For example, in the case of Saudi Arabia, the Department of
                    the Treasury wanted to be the lead U.S. agency. In other cases, it was State. I
                    worked with a couple of NSC staffers—Bob Oakley, Arthur Houghton (his
                    assistant)—on a series of drafts which were approved by Lord and Kissinger. We
                    set up model joint-commission compacts, which could be molded to the particular
                    circumstances of any specific relationship.</p>
                <p>The Saudi one became a major enterprise. The joint commission had offices in both
                    Riyadh and in Washington (in Treasury). It became the vehicle for U.S. agencies
                    (U.S. Corps of Engineers, Commerce, Weather Bureau, etc) rather deep involvement
                    in Saudi activities. The cost of the joint commission and all of its assistance
                    activities was borne by the Saudis. Some of the commissions were just vehicles
                    for annual or semi-annual meetings—once in Washington and once in the other
                    capital. Some were fairly pro forma and others were quite serious, but all in
                    all it was a very useful idea. I think a number of these joint commissions are
                    still extant; certainly the Saudi one is still going.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>We did not follow each of the commissions. The management of their operations was
                    left to the relevant regional bureau, although the S/P officer who followed that
                    particular region would monitor what was happening. The operations became part
                    of the normal duties of the State Department and the Foreign Offices involved.
                    Some have suggested that Kissinger, after having spawned the concept of joint
                    commissions lost interest in them. That could well be true because at the time
                    they met a specific political requirement. That was true for India, Morocco, and
                    Israel for example. Once the need was met, Kissinger probably lost interest. He
                    used them to meet specific political needs, mostly when they were first
                    established. After they had accomplished their purposes, he left the operations
                    to others although he did seem somewhat resentful that Treasury had been given
                    the chairmanship of some of the commissions. He wanted all of them to be under
                    State's flag. But he lost that battle.</p>
                <p>I had an other interesting assignment while in S/P. One Sunday, I got a call from
                    Winston. I remember vividly that I was painting some window sills when the call
                    came. He told me a serious crisis had erupted in Jordan and that the Department
                    was establishing a Task Force to deal with it. This period ultimately became
                    known as “Black September” when Palestinians in Jordan attempted to dethrone
                    King Hussein. Some civilian airplanes were blown up in the desert. Matters
                    became very tense and the Department set up a crisis center task force. Lord
                    said that my name had been suggested as chairman of the Task Force and could I
                    come to the Department immediately. So I washed the paint off my hands and face
                    and rushed down to State to head that Task Force. We spent a couple of weeks,
                    working around the clock. We drafted people from other parts of the Department
                    and other agencies. We worked in the Operations Center. We had to worry about
                    stranded Americans. We worried about the Syrians who seemed prepared to activate
                    their armored columns to support the Palestinians and that required close work
                    with the Defense Department. Our Ambassador, Dean Brown, was going back and
                    forth to the Palace in an armored car; matters became very tense in Jordan.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I had help on political matters from Talcott Seelye who was then the country
                    director for Jordan-Israel-Syria. President Nixon became very much involved in
                    this issue. I met with him once in his office—Talcott and I one Saturday morning
                    with Acting Secretary John Irwin went over to the White House. We were met by
                    General Haig who escorted us into the Oval Office. We briefed the President on
                    what was going on in Jordan. The President listened very carefully and made some
                    cogent comments. He instructed us to increase the assistance levels to Jordan by
                    several million dollars. On my return to the Department, I called Ernie Stern,
                    then the director of AID's Policy Planning and Coordination Staff, and told him
                    what the President had said. He said: “Wait a minute. It isn't that easy!”. I
                    told Ernie that if he had any problems, he could check with the White House. The
                    aid was increased immediately!. It was a very heady experience. We also briefed
                    Alexis Johnson, who was then Under Secretary for Political Affairs. After we had
                    spoken at some length about the problems of the Golan Heights, the Palestinians,
                    etc., I came away with the impression that Johnson didn't know much about the
                    area; he had asked some very elementary questions. I mentioned this to Talcott
                    who pointed out that Johnson had never served in that part of the world.
                    Nevertheless, I was struck that a man who becomes the most senior professional
                    in the Department and who presumably reads the New York Times with some care let
                    alone the policy cable traffic, seemed to know so little about such a key area
                    of the world. It seemed strange that he was still as Under Secretary, trying to
                    acquire a basic education in fact. I was astonished.</p>
                <p>The Task Force concluded when the Palestinian revolt was suppressed and when the
                    Syrians decided not to intervene, thanks also to some fast footwork on the part
                    of Henry Kissinger, including his threat to bring in U.S. paratroopers who were
                    based in Germany. You remember I mentioned that while at the War College, the
                    Commandant said at his initial welcoming speech, that we should look on each
                    side of us because one or both of the people there would be of some help to us
                    later? In fact, the guy who had been on my right during the Commandant's address
                    turned out to be the Air Force's Lieutenant General in charge of the Pentagon's
                    Task Force on the Jordanian crisis. He was working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                    at the time. It was palpably clear that he was quite relieved to know with whom
                    he was dealing in the Department. It eased the communications between the two
                    agencies considerably. We could speak to each other with ease and know that
                    whatever commitments we made on behalf of our agencies would be carried out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about your functions as the Secretary'
                        man on assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: I established close liaison with AID. I was invited to a lot of meetings
                    that heretofore had been closed to the Department of State. I am sure that the
                    fact that I still had an AID label helped considerably. I was privy to some of
                    the program decisions made and was involved in considerations of individual
                    country programs. I think I contributed something to the process because I
                    brought another perspective to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I should mention that after my Jordanian Task Force experience, which had gone
                    well, I was tapped again later for another Task Force. I became S/P's task force
                    expert. This time, I was assigned as director of the Cyprus Task Force in 1974,
                    which was a much bigger and longer one. That Task Force resulted from Makarios'
                    attempt to ease Turkey out of the island. The Greeks and Turks almost went to
                    war over that effort. The Colonels' government collapsed and was succeeded by a
                    new regime. The Turks sent a sizeable contingent of troops into Cyprus and they
                    drew a line of demarcation to separate the two communities. Many Greeks who
                    lived then on the Turkish side were forced to leave their homes, creating a
                    refugee problem. The Turks took about 40% of the land, although they were only
                    18% of the population. This was a much more intense experience that the
                    Jordanian one. The Task Force was very large. There were a large number of
                    American tourists stranded in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus who had to be evacuated.
                    We had to brief U.N. officials and representatives of the EC. I worked very
                    closely with Art Hartman, who was Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. That
                    Bureau had, just a few weeks earlier taken over responsibility for Turkey,
                    Greece and Cyprus, so that it didn't have much of an institutional memory or
                    experience in this area. Art Hartman and Jim Lowenstein, his deputy, worked
                    particularly closely with the Task Force. Phil Stoddard from INR, who was a
                    specialist on the area worked closely with us as well. He was invaluable. NEA,
                    which had been responsible for Turkey, assigned one of its officers, Peter
                    Sutherland, to the Task Force. Dick Bowers was our Executive Officer. The group
                    was large and of course we worked around the clock. We would change shifts every
                    eight hours and I would spend a lot of time trying to be with each shift for at
                    least a part of the time. The amount of cable traffic that had to be gone
                    through was unbelievable. It stood in piles and piles. It was a major task just
                    to read it, sort it, distribute it to the right places, and finally brief the
                    Secretary and the Deputy Secretary (Jack Irwin) on the contents. The Cyprus Task
                    Force lasted about six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave this part of your career, tell us a little
                        about S/P's role in the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The functions of S/P have changed from time to time depending in major
                    part on the relationship of the Director of the staff to the Secretary. Henry
                    Kissinger and Winston Lord had a very close tie, of course. So that in addition
                    to the normal functions of an S/P staff, we were also the speech writers. Lord
                    would take the lead on drafting speeches, but some of us would be involved in
                    the work depending on the subject. The S/P staff did not consider itself as the
                    “devil's advocate”. I did feel that Kissinger, not being very aware of such
                    modalities as the chain of command, often turned to his confidante, Winston
                    Lord, and asked him and S/P to do things that might normally be assigned to a
                    bureau. That is how I became director of two Task Forces. In the Jordanian case,
                    I happen to have had recent experience with Palestinians so that I did have a
                    relevant background for that job. I guess I also had the reputation as a manager
                    who could handle operational activities. When Cyprus came along, I had a track
                    record, so that when the Secretary turned to Lord, he tapped me again.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Kissinger left a legacy on the Cyprus issue that has become controversial. He was
                    accused by many people—certainly the Greeks—of having tilted towards Turkey and
                    of not having pushed the Turks sufficiently to give up if not all, much of the
                    territory they claimed and to withdraw their troops from the island. So his
                    legacy is vexed and in Greece he earned considerable demerits for his handling
                    of the Cyprus crisis. As I look back on it, however, I note that he avoided war
                    and that although the Cyprus issue remains a complex and difficult matter, we
                    continue to have the friendship and alliance of both Greece and Turkey. He
                    perhaps could have been a little tougher at some stages. He made one comment
                    that one of his principal problems was dealing with Archbishop Makarios, whom he
                    described once as “being too large a man for such a small country”. He thought
                    the Archbishop needed a much larger stage on which to perform.</p>
                <p>I don't want to suggest that the Task Force formulated policy. Kissinger did
                    that. We brought the latest information to him, Irwin and Hartman so that policy
                    could be formulated. Bill Macomber was our Ambassador in Turkey and Henry Tasca
                    was our Ambassador to Greece. I was on the phone to both continually and I was a
                    transmission belt. We assessed what was going on in the area. Lowenstein's job
                    was to brief all the European Ambassadors in Washington. Hartman used what
                    information and assessments we had to brief the Secretary. I used to brief Lord,
                    sometimes also the Secretary, but that was Art's job primarily. It was, however,
                    Kissinger who orchestrated the way we responded to the crisis. He would decide,
                    for example, that he should call the President of Brazil. So he had to have a
                    briefing paper on what he should say. He spoke frequently with the principals in
                    Ankara, Athens and Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seem to suggest that our role in the Cyprus crisis may
                        have led to the development of policies that have stood since then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes. Decisions made by Kissinger in a crisis moment have in effect become
                    permanent U.S. policies. For example, his decision not to press the Turks too
                    hard has stood the test of time, even though a number of us wished that he had
                    pushed harder for a diminution of the Turkish armed forces on Cyprus. It is
                    clear that the response to the crisis and subsequent events were orchestrated
                    and shaped by Kissinger. He handled all the levers himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>As far as my normal assignments—economic development and the UN—were concerned,
                    although they were not high on the Secretary's priority list, there was a great
                    deal of consternation and discussion in the UN on the “new economic order”.
                    Kissinger was dragged into this debate and had to be brought up to speed on
                    economic issues, which he had heretofore disdained. There was an occasion when
                    the President was going to address the UN on this “new economic order”.
                    Accusations had been made that the U.S. had somehow rigged the “old order” in a
                    way that was counter-productive and inimical to the well-being and destiny of
                    the Third World. There was a major confrontation in the U.N. which included
                    attempts by certain U.N. members to reorganize the U.N. apparatus. The U.S. was
                    on the defensive. Kissinger became involved in the damage limitation process and
                    our efforts to try to turn the situation around so that our interests would not
                    be undermined. He began an intensive study of economic issues. I would be called
                    from time to time as one or another arose. I remember once that Kissinger was
                    called upon to brief a half dozen Senators on the question of how we intended to
                    handle the challenges from these Third World critics and how we intended to deal
                    with the challenge of the “new economic order”. Tom Enders had been conducting
                    most of Henry's briefings (Economics 101). Kissinger characteristically mastered
                    the subject matter and was able to deal with the Senators with ease. Kissinger
                    always wanted verbatim notes of his meetings. Peter Rodman, who was Kissinger's
                    personal assistant, had devised a system that would capture all of Kissinger's
                    comments and keep them for posterity. I was not able to attend the meeting with
                    the Senators (both Lord and Rodman did attend), but I saw the transcript of the
                    meeting. Kissinger's performance was absolutely masterful. He had understood all
                    he had been briefed on; he had absorbed the material and was able to outline it
                    to his listeners in a clear and precise manner. It was a tour de force on
                    economic issues which showed what a quick study he was. It was a very
                    professional economic briefing.</p>
                <p>Enders, Lord, and a couple of us were involved in this whole U.N. effort, along
                    with Ambassador Moynihan. We wrote papers, drafted speeches, lobbied other
                    nations. Moynihan was in Washington for a day and I was his escort officer. I
                    took him around and had a liquid lunch with him. That was an exciting
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Cyprus Task Force had just been shut down and I had gone home for what I
                    hoped to be my first good night's sleep. I didn't get home until after midnight,
                    was planning to sleep late. At eight o'clock in the morning, the phone rang. It
                    was my office announcing that the Secretary intended to visit the Task Force
                    that morning and I should be in the office. I got dressed as fast as I have ever
                    done, ran to my car, zoomed down to the Department just as the Secretary was
                    finishing his tour. As he left, he did thank me warmly for my efforts on Cyprus.
                    I had a couple of other meetings with Kissinger during which I was the note
                    taker (Rodman couldn't be at all the meetings). Fortunately for me, Art Hartman
                    also took notes because I could not possibly have recorded the full text of what
                    was being said.</p>
                <p>I was able to leave S/P with a good record of my activities. It was a very busy
                    two years. I wrote a lot of memoranda, papers, and speeches on the issues I was
                    following.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you consider the practice of “policy by speeches” to
                        be sound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Very much so. In fact, I think this was a calculated Kissinger ploy, for
                    what it did was to ensure that in the speech clearance process all interested
                    parties came to agreement on a policy. This was particularly true on economic
                    policy, which was my beat. My drafts had to be cleared by the Treasury and
                    Commerce Departments, AID and OMB. This clearance process took a lot of work,
                    which sometime forced policy decisions that may have been submerged for a while,
                    and resolved policy conflicts because the speech had a deadline and therefore
                    drafts had to be put in final by a definite date. It sometimes even took
                    Kissinger's intervention with the Secretary of the Treasury, Bill Simon. Those
                    two were not very compatible. In a few cases, the issue in debate had to go to
                    the President. But the advantage of this process was that it forced decisions
                    and demanded a carefully articulated statement of policy which furthered
                    Kissinger's view of the role of the United States and strengthened the hand of
                    the State Department.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, the bureaucracy itself used this process to advance one of its own
                    positions or ideas. But in the Kissinger era, those opportunities were rare
                    because he was one Secretary who knew what he wanted to say and had a very clear
                    notion of his foreign policy direction. To the extent that agendas, derived from
                    bureaucratic underlings, were inserted in the speeches is another matter, but.
                    by and large, Kissinger knew what he wanted to say, had a clear view of how to
                    say it, had a sense of style and was a very tough task-master. When I started
                    drafting a speech, I had clear guidelines within which to work. In fact,
                    Kissinger would meet with Winston Lord and sketch out the points he wanted
                    covered. Lord would then brief us and, in some cases, wrote the first draft
                    himself. Peter Rodman was also an excellent wordsmith and stylist. He was the
                    principal editor of Kissinger's two memoirs and had helped on many speeches. As
                    I said earlier, there were a lot of good people in S/P who had been recruited by
                    Lord. Tom Enders who was in charge of the Economics and Business Bureau was one
                    of the brightest members of the Foreign Service. Arthur Hartman at EUR was also
                    first rate. So there was a lot of talent around Kissinger.</p>
                <p>My two years in S/P forged many friendships. Most of my colleagues of those days
                    have gone on to other pursuits. It was a heady and worthwhile experience, which
                    I would not have wished to miss. Looking back, I certainly feel that I made the
                    right decision to leave Beirut and return to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1976, you became the Special Representative of the
                        President and Director of the United States Sinai Support Mission. How did
                        that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>KONTOS: I guess it was the result of my directorship of the two Task Forces that
                    I have earlier described. Since those groups worked well, I guess I became known
                    to the Department's leadership. The Sinai job was not one that I sought; in fact
                    I don't think I ever went out to seek any job, beyond my first one.</p>
                <p>At that time, the headquarters of the Sinai Mission was on the Seventh Floor of
                    the Department of State. That is where it was established initially; much, much
                    later it moved to Rome as headquarters of the successor organization—the
                    Multilateral Force and Observers organization (MFO).</p>
                <p>Essentially, the Mission was one result of Kissinger's shuttle which took place
                    after the war of 1973. At that time, the Secretary was able to persuade the
                    Egyptians and Israelis to agree to a transition period before the Sinai was
                    turned over to Egypt. The transition period was intended as a time when both
                    sides could build confidence in the peaceful intent of the other. It enabled
                    Kissinger to lower tensions between the two foes and reduce the prospects of
                    further clashes between them.</p>
                <p>The Sinai Mission was established in the Sinai astride the traditional invasion
                    routes—the Mitla and Gidi Passes. Under the terms of the agreement signed by the
                    U.S., Egypt and Israel, the U.S. was committed to deploy a civilian
                    peace-keeping force in the Sinai that would protect the approaches to these
                    passes from either side. This was to be done by setting up observation posts,
                    electronic sensors and listening devices that would monitor any activity in the
                    passes or nearby. Moreover, as part of the agreement, both Egypt and Israel were
                    permitted a major observation point, which was to be manned by themselves. The
                    Israelis already had one; the Egyptians were permitted to build one of their
                    own. That allowed each side also to verify with its own people that no invasion
                    force was approaching the passes. The Secretary and the NSC decided that the
                    State Department would become responsible for the management of this observation
                    effort. The Department decided to employ a civilian contractor who would work
                    under the direction of the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In the Fall of 1975, Joe Sisco, then Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Frank
                    Wisner of the Secretariat and Bob Oakley of the NSC were assigned the
                    responsibility for drafting the first mission statement. In December, 1975, I
                    was asked by Winston Lord, on behalf of the Secretary, to take charge of the
                    project. The man who had been working on the project had already brought in some
                    people—one from the Pentagon, a naval contractor, a couple from the research arm
                    of the Army, a Marine Corps Colonel. When I was sworn in as Special
                    Representative of the President, a partial staff was already in place and a
                    request for proposals (RFP) had been publicized in a Commerce announcement. The
                    proposals were for the establishment of a field mission, including housing for
                    up to 200 people, observation posts at both ends of the passes, deployment of
                    electronic gear, placement of the sensors, procurement of observation gear
                    (telescopes, binoculars, night vision devices), and finally to construct a
                    facility in the Sinai. The contractor also had to man this observation operation
                    24 hours each day, The responses were coming in as I took over the job. There
                    was some urgency in making decisions because we were working on a deadline,
                    which was sometime in the following Spring. A special appropriation had been
                    made so that funds were not a problem.</p>
                <p>My first task was to review each of the proposals that were already coming in.
                    That was done meticulously and with great care. We set up a special board which
                    included people with contracting expertise from various agencies to review the
                    proposals. We established a dozen criteria that had to be met. Weights were
                    given to those proposals that best met the criteria. In the end, the successful
                    bidder was a Texas organization, headquartered outside of Dallas, called “E
                    Systems”. It, in turn, negotiated a subcontract with a Texas construction firm
                    to build the facilities—housing, offices, observation posts. The subcontractor,
                    H. B. Zachary, was headquartered in El Paso and accustomed to building with
                    pre-fabricated concrete units. They had used that process in the construction of
                    motels. These concrete units were ideal for the Sinai requirements; each had
                    living accommodations, kitchens, bedrooms. They were designed to be placed one
                    on top of the other, so that a building of almost any dimension could be put up.
                    The contractor obtained these units from an existing job and put them on a ship
                    leaving Corpus Christi, Texas to be delivered in the Sinai.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, a group, including two or three men from my office and some we
                    borrowed from the Defense Department, went out to the Sinai to survey the
                    situation. They went to both Cairo and Jerusalem and established links with
                    liaison officials of both sides. They identified a site appropriate for the
                    Sinai Field Mission. The Sinai was then still Israeli occupied up to the passes.
                    Beyond those passes, towards the Suez Canal, the land was in Egyptian hands,
                    although Egypt had no military presence there. Only nomads wandered around in
                    the area between the Suez and the passes. The only Egyptian military presence in
                    the Sinai permitted by the agreement was the personnel to man the observation
                    post. We chose the site, the perimeter of which was to be patrolled by armed
                    U.N. guards. Our personnel would be unarmed.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We are now in January 1976. “E Systems” and the construction contractor used a
                    number of airplanes—converted 747s—to ship the construction material in order to
                    build a temporary facility on the site we had selected. This temporary base was
                    to be used by the construction workers and also to serve as the beginning of our
                    operations. We established communications between Washington, Jerusalem and
                    Cairo. There was a lot of work that had to be done in a short period of time. E
                    systems was expert in loading the planes so that the material was unloaded in a
                    proper sequence. We did have a crisis when the issue arose as to how the heavy
                    concrete units would be brought into the Sinai; this required flat bed trucks.
                    The passes were obviously much closer to Egypt and we thought we would use that
                    route—from Cairo to the Canal, across the Canal and to the site. But the roads
                    on the Egyptian part of the Sinai were meager and primitive; also there were no
                    facilities in any Egyptian port for unloading these heavy units. Even if there
                    had been adequate cranes, the trucks might have had problems crossing the Suez
                    and might have blocked the Canal. So we scrapped the idea of landing them in
                    Egypt and took them to Haifa instead. The route was obviously much longer, but
                    roads were paved all the way to the Sinai site.</p>
                <p>As the ships were en route to Haifa, I got a call from my deputy in Washington. I
                    was in Cairo on one of my frequent trips during this period. He told me that the
                    construction contractor's shipping agent had said that if the ship docks in
                    Haifa, he would be in violation of the Arab embargo. That would mean that no
                    other ships of that shipping line would henceforth be permitted to dock in an
                    Arab port. So we had to get involved in finessing the Arab embargo rules. We had
                    our Ambassador approach the head-quarters of the embargo enforcement agency,
                    which was in Damascus, to see whether the Haifa docking would be a violation. We
                    were able in the end to persuade the shipping line to dock in Haifa without
                    penalty. I have a vague recollection that in order to avoid the embargo, the
                    ship had to stop in a neutral port first (Nicosia, I believe) and then it could
                    proceed to Haifa. I am not clear on the details, but some kind of legal
                    subterfuge was worked out. That was one of the many, many difficulties that we
                    overcame.</p>
                <p>I must say that I had terrific cooperation from both the Egyptians and the
                    Israelis. The Egyptians appointed a Major General to be the liaison officer and
                    the Israelis appointed an Army Intelligence Corps Colonel. They both were
                    skilled at cutting corners and through red tape. I shuttled between Cairo and
                    Jerusalem and Washington.</p>
                <p>The temporary camps were constructed. The first message was sent reporting to me
                    and to the Secretary that the Mission was in business. The living conditions
                    were far from ideal; winter in the Sinai in prefabs was not exactly a
                    picnic.</p>
                <p>We also had to establish a continual support system for the Mission. Most of the
                    fresh fruit and vegetables came from Egypt and the rest of the food stuffs from
                    Israel. E Systems was responsible for supplying all the provisions.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>After the Mission was working, its main functions were to observe events around
                    the passes and to maintain liaison with both sides to resolve any disputes that
                    arose from observations—ours as well as theirs. We had to report any trespasses
                    into the neutral zone. We had a very elaborate reporting system to both sides
                    and to Washington, so that if there were a violation of either the airspace or
                    the neutral zone by any unauthorized vehicle or person—we had occasional
                    mistaken penetrations by people who did not know where the boundaries were or
                    who may not have had appropriate authorizations—there would be an immediate
                    report made. There were a number of unauthorized penetrations, mostly by
                    uninformed people. The more difficult aspect was air violations, which we did
                    not handle as well as ground ones. We had a U.S. airplane monitor the Sinai
                    periodically, that provided air cover for events in the Sinai and provided
                    pictures to both sides from those flights. These planes had very good military
                    photographic equipment on board; we used U-2s with the agreement of both
                    parties.</p>
                <p>Our main objective was to build confidence that the U.S. was serving both sides
                    even-handedly and effectively.</p>
                <p>We had a number of sticky moments. None of the Egyptian or Israeli observers were
                    to have arms of any kind—personal weapons or otherwise. There were some attempts
                    made to bring arms into each side's observer posts. The Israelis had a very
                    sophisticated observation point filled with the latest in listening and
                    detecting equipment. The Egyptians were building a much more primitive post on
                    their side of the passes. Both sides tried from time to time to pass our posts
                    with guns, which they always said were with them inadvertently. We always
                    checked the Israeli and Egyptian observers as they went to and from their
                    observation posts. The Americans who did this checking were Foreign Service
                    officers from State and AID. We had 12-15 young FSOs who were liaison officers
                    to the two sides. The E Systems people manned the sensors and other observation
                    equipment, but dealing with each side was left to the FSOs who were stationed at
                    each observation post. The FSOs lived first in temporary and then in permanent
                    barracks along with the E Systems people. They would go to their posts every
                    eight hours where they observed what was going on in the observation posts of
                    each side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it decided that these observation post duties
                        would be performed by Foreign Service officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Because it was a ticklish matter. We needed some people who had a feel
                    for the sensitivities of the situation. The FSOs had other responsibilities.
                    From time to time, they would be assigned to our offices in both Egypt and
                    Israel. Two or three would man those offices on a rotational basis. They served
                    as our day to day liaison to both countries. We therefore needed people with
                    some good sense; in some cases, we required an officer with language skills. The
                    assignment of an FSO or an AID officer to the Sinai Mission was for one year,
                    but I think for them it was a very interesting, rewarding assignment despite
                    some of the long and tedious hours at the observation posts. They got a lot out
                    of their assignments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one evaluate the success of an enterprise like
                        the Sinai Support Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: You judge it by the fact that it had a beginning, a middle and an end. It
                    fulfilled all the agreements signed by all three parties after the Egyptians
                    withdrew from the Sinai: the US, the Israelis and the Egyptians. The deal was
                    sweetened for the Israelis—who in giving up the Sinai also had to give up two
                    airbases—by two substitute bases financed by us on their territory. That cost
                    the US several hundreds of million dollars. The Israelis withdrew from the whole
                    of Sinai by the end of 1981, except for a very small area called Taba, which had
                    been in dispute ever since the negotiations had started. It took further
                    international mediation before Taba—with its large Israeli tourist hotel-was
                    returned to the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>The whole arrangement worked out very well, thanks in major part to our presence
                    and our role as intermediary plus our financial generosity—that made it
                    worthwhile for the Israelis to give up their two airbases—including large
                    amounts of foreign assistance for the following years up to and including
                    today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in obtaining Congressional support for
                        the Sinai arrangement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The enabling legislation which authorized the funds also included a
                    requirement for semi-annual reports. So now there is a complete record of what
                    occurred throughout the life of the Sinai Mission. There were also Congressional
                    hearings. On the House side, it was Lee Hamilton's Europe-Middle East
                    subcommittee that held the hearings; on the Senate side, it varied. For a long
                    time the hearings were chaired by Senator Kassebaum of Kansas. I used to brief
                    her privately as well. Hamilton had regular hearings. I was very pleased that I
                    was able to report to him regularly that we had not spent all the funds
                    appropriated because of our efficient operation. The Congressmen were very
                    pleased to hear that.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I was the Director of the Sinai Support Mission for four years. After I left, the
                    construction work was all done, the observation routine had been well
                    established. While still Director and after things had settled down, I made it a
                    practice to visit the area periodically, making sure that I would alternate my
                    starting points between Cairo and Jerusalem. I used to talk to both sides and
                    brief them on what was going on. The trips were often just an opportunity to
                    maintain cordial relationships with both sides, but there were always problems
                    cropping up—transportation, clearances. At the height of our construction
                    program, there were probably 185 people on site; we never reached the 200 mark.
                    E Systems brought in people largely from Greenville, Texas which is where their
                    plant was located. Many of them had never been outside of Greenville when then,
                    all of a sudden, they found themselves in the Sinai with access to both Egypt
                    and Israel. To deal with culture shock, we mounted an orientation program for
                    the E Systems people, with specific emphasis on the principal executives of the
                    contractor. Initially, we put on a two day program for them. They were briefed
                    by Gordon Beyer who was on the Egypt desk, Larry Eagleburger, and others.</p>
                <p>Of course, E Systems had to recruit their own staff for the tasks in the Sinai. I
                    was amazed at how few problems their personnel created. Only a few got a little
                    tipsy, but there were no real drinking problems. One or two were sent back home
                    because they were found with some pot but, in general, there were no drug
                    problems. In the latter stages of my tour, we permitted women to work in the
                    Sinai; we had no problems with that. It was remarkable how little trouble we did
                    have. In part, that was due to the E Systems' careful selection process; they
                    picked people who were courteous, flexible and tolerant and who turned out to be
                    good representatives of America abroad, even though most had never left Texas
                    before. The supervisory staff served for two years and the others worked for
                    12-18 months.</p>
                <p>I had two deputies on my staff: one was living in the field and one was in
                    Washington. The deputy in the field was in charge of the whole operation; the E
                    Systems people reported to him. He controlled the operations; he in fact was the
                    Mayor of a small town in the Sinai. They had a fire brigade, a security force a
                    cafeteria. etc. My deputy established the ground rules for leaves, etc. He was
                    also the principal liaison with the UN which as I mentioned guarded the
                    perimeters of our observation operations. They consisted of two rotating
                    battalions: one Ghanaian and one Fijian. My deputy was also the principal
                    liaison with the Egyptians and the Israelis and in charge of our two offices in
                    Cairo and Jerusalem. My first deputy was Nick Thorne, whose wife resided in
                    Cairo; his deputy was Owen Roberts, whose wife lived in Jerusalem. The officers
                    themselves lived in the Sinai station. They may have seen their wives briefly
                    every two weeks or so.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>There was a story I might mention at this point. One of the drivers of the Sinai
                    Field Mission director was made available to me when I would visit the area. He
                    was a 19-20 year old Texan who had never left Greenville until this assignment.
                    He may have had one year at the local community college and then had joined the
                    E Systems. He was a splendid driver. But the most fascinating part of this young
                    man's experience was how rapidly he mastered basic Arabic so that he could drive
                    around Cairo. He knew all the labyrinths in Cairo of which there are many. He
                    mastered the topography of Cairo so well that he could find almost any location
                    in the fastest way possible; he knew where the traffic jams were forming and how
                    to bypass them. He acquired the same skills for Jerusalem and Tel Aviv—he
                    learned enough Hebrew to get by in Israel as well. Everybody knew him; everybody
                    greeted him warmly. Sometimes, when he needed to get directions, he would ask
                    for them in the local tongue with a Texas accent. It was an eye opener for us
                    and a wonderful experience for him.</p>
                <p>Before we leave my Sinai experience, I would like to make one more point. The
                    Sinai Support Mission was, in my view, one of the most successful cooperative
                    venture between the government and the private sector that I know about. It was
                    run by the Department of State; it handled a major contractual negotiation; it
                    oversaw the work of two splendid large Texan firms; it was a model in many ways
                    of how the U.S. government and the private sector can collaborate effectively.
                    We issued guidelines on the dos and don'ts. The relationship was very amicable
                    and constructive and in the final analysis, very productive. When people say
                    that the State Department doesn't know “how to run things”, they should look
                    back on the Sinai operations which were exceptionally well orchestrated and an
                    illustration of good efficient and effective management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we end this discussion, I would like to ask how
                        much interest did the Secretary and other senior principals show in the work
                        of the Sinai Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>KONTOS: A great deal. Initially, the whole operation was run out of Eagleburger's
                    office, when he was the Under Secretary for Management. He was personally
                    involved until the Carter administration came in and then it was to the NSC that
                    I reported regularly. The Congress, when it authorized the Sinai operation, made
                    it technically an independent agency. We had our own line item in the budget. My
                    official title was Special Representative of the President and Director of the
                    Sinai Support Mission. I reported to the Secretary of State and to the
                    President, although in the real world, it was to the President's Special
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs, first Scowcroft and then Brzezinski,
                    who followed our activities on behalf of the President. So I worked closely with
                    the NSC as well as Larry Eagleburger. Secretary Vance showed considerable
                    interest in the operation when he became Secretary of State; he was very much
                    engaged during his early days when Congress mandated a restriction on the number
                    of Americans who could be posted in the Sinai. (They were concerned for their
                    security). I remember that one day, right after lunch, I got a call from the
                    Secretary's Office that I needed to come up with a master plan which would
                    determine the number of Americans needed to be in the Sinai at any one time so
                    that he could convey this information to a Congressional committee which was in
                    the process of establishing this limit. So the two of us decided rather
                    arbitrarily what the personnel limits would be.</p>
                <p>Ben Read, who succeeded Eagleburger as Under Secretary for Management, also
                    continued to show much interest in our activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980, you finished your tour as Director of theSinai
                        Support Mission and were appointed as Ambassador to the Sudan. How did that
                        come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: As I said, in the course of my Sinai work, I had come to know the
                    Secretary and the other principals on the Seventh Floor. I suppose it was deemed
                    by them appropriate that I be given some recognition for a successful operation
                    and the ambassadorship to the Sudan came open. Dick Moose, then the Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs, asked me whether I would be interested. Then I
                    got a formal call from Ben Read to ask me the same question on behalf of the
                    Secretary. And I told both “Yes”. In fact, there was another ambassadorial
                    vacancy and I was asked which I preferred. I picked the Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Sudan when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>KONTOS: The Sudan was at that time already under the long term domination of
                    General Gaafar Nimeiri. His regime had started in 1969, following a coup he
                    engineered. He made himself President. He tried to emulate Nasser and the young
                    officers' revolution movement of Egypt. He tried to follow Egypt's model
                    politically, and associated himself with the Soviet Union. In the immediate
                    aftermath of his coup, there was an extended honeymoon with the Soviets, which
                    included a large, in the several thousands, Soviet advisory presence, both in
                    the economic and in the military fields. Remnants of that era still continue
                    today. For example, in the outskirts of Khartoum, there is a large hospital
                    built by the Soviets; there are still Soviet built roads and other
                    manifestations of a close, cordial and important relationship between the Sudan
                    and the Soviet Union. The Sudanese communists with overweening ambition decided
                    that Nimeiri was too great an obstacle to their long term objectives and
                    attempted to remove him through a coup in 1972. The coup was aborted in a few
                    days and thanks to some fast footwork, he was able to escape their clutches,
                    although he had been incarcerated by them for a couple of days. Nimeiri escaped
                    and mounted a counter-attack with some loyal troops. When he returned to power,
                    he proceeded to eliminate the presence of both Soviets and local communists. He
                    executed a number of the ring leaders; the Sudan's relationship with the Soviet
                    Union became cold and distant and ultimately the whole Soviet aid effort and its
                    special programs were ended. The U.S. at the time had been in something of a
                    limbo; we had an Embassy and an Ambassador, but relationships were very
                    strained. It was also during this period that Palestinian terrorists took over
                    the Saudi residence during a farewell party being given for our departing
                    Ambassador, Cleo Noel. He and his DCM were imprisoned in the Saudi residence;
                    valiant attempts were made to negotiate their release—Bill Macomber was
                    despatched to Khartoum to free Noel, but a sand storm delayed his arrival. In
                    the confusion and in the absence of good communications, the terrorist
                    apparently felt that they had been double-crossed or not given the necessary
                    assurances and proceeded to assassinate Cleo and his DCM. The relationships
                    between the U.S. and the Sudan were already rocky; this episode turned them sour
                    even through the terrorists were captured and incarcerated. Later they were
                    transferred to a jail in Cairo, where they still languish, as far as I know.
                    After Nasser's death in 1970, the Soviet influence waned considerably in Egypt
                    and Sadat threw them out soon after taking office.</p>
                <p>By the time I arrived in 1980, U.S. relationships with the Sudan were beginning
                    to warm up. I arrived during a transition from the end of Soviet influence to a
                    growing acceptance by Sudan of the U.S. That resulted in a growth in our aid
                    program, both economic and military. By the end of my three years there, the
                    Sudan had one of the largest aid programs in Africa, well over $150 million
                    including military and economic assistance.</p>
                <p>The Sudan is astride the Nile River which gives life and sustenance to Egypt. At
                    least a neutral and preferably a friendly Sudan is very much in our interests.
                    Sudan borders on seven other countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, the
                    Central African Republic, Chad and Libya. So it is surrounded by a number of
                    volatile neighbors. That Sudan can be a bastion of stability inclined favorably
                    to the West, is very much in our interest and of vital importance to Egypt.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>We also viewed Sudan as an offset to Libya. There was a growing estrangement
                    between Qadhafi and Nimeiri. In fact, during my tour, it turned into a vitriolic
                    hatred; they would call each other harsh names. This was also the period during
                    which the Libyans moved into the Chad, with elements of Libyan armed forces
                    trying to sustain rebels in Darfur, the most western province of the Sudan. That
                    certainly further inflamed the tensions between Libya and the Sudan.</p>
                <p>In the civil war in Ethiopia, the Tigreans and the other opposition groups to the
                    Mengistu regime were given sanctuary and sustenance by the Sudan. The Sudan
                    greatly helped the Mengistu opposition. Our basic objective for the Sudan was to
                    induce an Arabic speaking country to take moderate positions on Middle East
                    issues. Only Egypt, the Sudan and one other Arab country—Morocco,—publicly
                    supported the Camp David accords.</p>
                <p>We did not have any economic interests in the Sudan. An American oil
                    company—Chevron—made an intense effort to find oil and was successful. It was
                    finding more when the current civil war broke out in the Sudan in mid-83. The
                    Sudan was then well on its way to becoming a respectable oil producer—something
                    comparable by conservative estimates to Tunisia. There were indications that
                    potentially sizeable reserves might be found. There was considerable speculation
                    that the large area called the Sudd, which is a gigantic swamp through which the
                    White Nile flows, might well contain very large pools of oil. That was our major
                    economic interest. Most of the oil found by Chevron was in the south. Some of it
                    was in the border area between the north and the south and Nimeiri, in one of
                    his less felicitous moments, tried to redraft the maps by extending the north to
                    include the areas of Chevron's finds. That caused a great uproar in the south.
                    We were mindful, of course, of the fact the Sudan shares the Red Sea with Saudi
                    Arabia which made Port Sudan a marginally important strategic asset. We had
                    finally reached agreement with the government to preposition military equipment
                    in Port Sudan for use by American forces in case of any hostilities in that part
                    of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sudan is not a homogeneous country. It is divided into
                        several parts. Tell us something about the internal political issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>KONTOS: There is west Sudan—the provinces of Kordofan and Darfur—which, although
                    nominally Muslim, has very distinctive tribal identities. Then there is the
                    rather exotic tribe of the Fur who live in the southern part of Darfur. So the
                    west is a distinct regional entity. Then there is the south filled by a large
                    number of black tribes—Shilluks, Dinka, Nuer, etc—each with its own sense of
                    identity. There was a growing Christian community in the south because under
                    British colonial policies as conducted by the Anglo-Egyptian condominium,
                    proselytizing was only permitted in the south. So both the Catholics and the
                    Protestants were very active in that region, establishing missions and schools.
                    They could not function in Muslim dominated areas. This created the very
                    interesting phenomenon that 15% of the southern population, according to my own
                    guess, including almost all of the southern elite, are Christian—mostly
                    Protestant, but some Catholic as well. The balance of the population are either
                    Muslim or animists, following their own tribal deities. The southern Sudan is a
                    very rich mixture of tribes, cultures, languages, religions and unfortunately, a
                    long history of animosity internally and vis a vis the North.</p>
                <p>Our political relationships with the Sudan while I was there worked well. Nimeiri
                    was very helpful to us because he maintained a barrier against Libyan
                    expansionist goals. The French and we were trying to get Libya out of Chad and
                    he supported us in that effort. Nimeiri showed great solidarity with Egypt and
                    with Saudi Arabia. He handled the post Camp David period very well from our
                    point of view by sticking with Egypt when it became isolated in the Arab world.
                    As I mentioned earlier, the Sudan agreed to preposition equipment in Port Sudan
                    and that was very helpful. We held joint military exercises. During my tour, the
                    Sudan became increasingly a close friend to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You earlier mentioned the major assistance programs we
                        were conducting in the Sudan. What was their nature and what were we trying
                        to achieve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The Sudan has an extraordinary agricultural potential. In fact, it was
                    described by earlier economists as the potential “bread basket” of the Arab
                    world. It has hundreds of acres of untilled land. Some large agriculture areas
                    were irrigated thanks to the major efforts made by the British in building
                    canals and other appurtenances required for irrigation. We, in developing our
                    assistance programs, recognized the high costs of irrigation and the inevitable
                    productivity diminution over time and began to concentrate on the rain-fed parts
                    of the Sudan through various programs like extension work, seed development and
                    other projects designed to increase the productivity of that agriculture.</p>
                <p>The Sudan has aquifers, but we did not consider them as an economic source of
                    water, unlike Qadhafi who is constructing a huge pipeline from the aquifers in
                    the southern part of Libya to the north at a tremendous cost that will make use
                    of that water entirely uneconomical.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>While agriculture was the main focus of our assistance programs, we did look at
                    the economy as a whole and tried to persuade the Sudanese to shed some of their
                    government corporations, all which were losing money. We were successful to some
                    degree in that effort and they did privatize some of their corporations and they
                    did start moving into a market economy. This was another aspect of our
                    relationship which we considered helpful; they did move away from a rigid
                    socialist dogma propounded by their erstwhile Soviet advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have enough sufficiently trained Sudanese to work
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: We had enough; certainly not a surplus, but an adequate number to handle
                    the problems. The ministries were fairly well staffed by British trained
                    bureaucrats, although by the time I arrived, a number had left the Sudan to go
                    to the Gulf states where there were jobs that were much more remunerative. They
                    sent remittances back to their families in the Sudan. So there was a
                    considerable “brain drain” that went on while we were in the Sudan which
                    continues even today. Despite this exodus, there was an adequate cadre of
                    trained Sudanese with whom we could deal. Also the University of Khartoum, which
                    was a respectable academic institution, and a couple of other good universities
                    produced graduates who were competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to worry about the North-South split in the
                        allocation of aid resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Yes, we did. The South always wanted to have its fair share of the
                    assistance. We were sensitive to its needs. The South covered a large land mass
                    of the Sudan. We established an office in Juba, the southern capital. When I
                    arrived in the Sudan, the South, as a result of the Addis Ababa agreement that
                    ended the long civil war and which had in large measure been orchestrated by
                    Nimeiri himself, operated as a semi-autonomous region. It had its own
                    government, its own Parliament though foreign affairs, defense and finance were
                    handled by Khartoum. The South ran most of its internal affairs. The Parliament
                    was elected regularly. It was the beginning of a government by the South for the
                    South. So the Sudan was in fact a loose federation. The President of the South
                    reported to Nimeiri because Khartoum held the purse strings; the South was
                    poverty stricken with a small tax base; it could not survive without financial
                    assistance from the North. The South ran a third- rate government with very few
                    sufficiently trained people; it was just trying to establish a coherent
                    government apparatus which is very difficult to do under those conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I mentioned earlier the North-South debate over whose territory Chevron had found
                    oil. Related to that debate, was the question of the location of a prospective
                    refinery. The South wanted infrastructure and projects which would employ its
                    natives. Chevron, for good economic reasons, thought that Port Sudan should be
                    the appropriate location because it would be the tanker loading site. The South
                    wouldn't buy that rationale; it challenged the Chevron rationale because it
                    would have deprived the South of an economically rewarding project. So I had my
                    hands full trying to persuade the southern ministers that this was not a Nimeiri
                    power play with Chevron being his “front man”. I was able to diffuse to a major
                    extent the deep felt frustration of the South, but there were some tense
                    moments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to get involved in other North-South
                        disputes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The South looked for anyone of any importance to speak on their behalf to
                    Nimeiri. More and more, the government's decision making became centered in
                    Khartoum and particularly in Nimeiri. He became an all-purpose dictator.
                    Everyone knew that I had unparalleled access to him and tried to use me as an
                    advocate. Any time someone had a grievance, I would be sure to be briefed on the
                    subject in the hopes that if I had an opportunity, assuming that I saw some
                    merit in the position being put forward, I would be a spokesman for that
                    position with Nimeiri. Access to the key man was absolutely imperative in that
                    kind of a situation and I had that.</p>
                <p>As happens historically, persons with that much power tend increasingly to be cut
                    off from reality. Their staffs and entourages tend to speak only about positive
                    developments and become afraid to convey bad news or to paint a true picture of
                    a situation. The dictator is thereby protected from what is happening outside
                    the palace. And that is what was happening to Nimeiri; he was becoming
                    increasingly isolated. I saw my role as a bearer of some reality and an
                    awareness of what was happening in his own country. As Nimeiri's entourage
                    happened to be primarily Northerners, the South did not get a full hearing of
                    its problems and grievances. I must add that there were two or three ministerial
                    portfolios in the central government that were manned by southerners. They were
                    minor cabinet positions—housing and transportation—but not enough to keep
                    Nimeiri fully briefed on events and trends in the Sudan.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>For much of my tenure, one of the Vice-Presidents was Joseph Lagu—a southerner.
                    He had been the principal leader of the opposition during the civil war. After
                    the Addis Ababa agreement, Lagu became the head of the southern government and
                    made a mess of that. After a hiatus, he was made one of Sudan's two Vice
                    Presidents. The other one was a very fine professional soldier, Lieutenant
                    General Abdul Majid. As I said, I saw my role as the conveyor to Nimeiri of U.S.
                    concerns and as a reporter of the Sudanese scene of those areas where I felt he
                    lacked adequate knowledge. I particularly concentrated on southern issues
                    because Lagu, while a southerner, was also a member of a tribe that felt that
                    the Dinka majority in the South, including much of the southern leadership, was
                    playing a disproportionate role. Lagu started to agitate for a revision of the
                    Addis Ababa agreements that would divide the South into three equal provinces,
                    one of which would be governed by his own tribe and largely eliminate the single
                    Southern government. Nimeiri had earlier divided the North into three areas.
                    During the early days of my tour, there were four provinces in the North
                    administered by governors, who were well qualified persons and whom Nimeiri had
                    given a fair amount of authority. He asked for our assistance in this process by
                    reducing the power of the center of giving greater authority and
                    self-determination to the provinces. Lagu was arguing for the same scheme to be
                    applied in the South, although there it represented an extremely dangerous
                    political risk. Nimeiri was being lulled by Lagu, who kept bringing him
                    petitions for a division of the South that he had obtained from various
                    quarters. These views all reflected a minority tribal point of view, but since
                    Lagu had access to Nimeiri, the continual belaboring of the point became quite
                    influential.</p>
                <p>Nimeiri finally succumbed; he agreed to divide the South into three provinces.
                    That created a tremendous uproar because it violated the Addis Ababa agreements;
                    it destroyed the structure of a semi-autonomous Southern government and
                    contributed to the growing animosity of the southern tribal groupings. There
                    were a number of incidents of growing disenchantment with Nimeiri on the part of
                    the southerners. There was a definite difference between the first and second
                    halves of my tenure in Khartoum. When I first arrived in the Sudan, one of my
                    first visits was to Juba, the southern capital. I saw a lot of people, both
                    within and outside the government. I traveled fairly widely in the South. I
                    received the general impression that although the northerners were not trusted,
                    particularly the elite that ran the Khartoum government, the southerners did
                    trust Nimeiri, who was viewed as the author of the Addis Ababa agreements and as
                    one who understood the South and had in fact befriended it. By the end of my
                    tour, there was a growing antagonism and a deep mistrust of Nimeiri. He was
                    viewed as one who was trying to take their oil away, was skewing aid programs to
                    favor the North; he was no longer seen as one interested in the whole country,
                    but rather as a northern partisan.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Late in my tour, the military took a very key decision with Nimiery's blessings.
                    On the face of it, it seemed a very ordinary move. The military decided to
                    transfer some garrisons that were stationed in the South to the North and
                    conversely, move some of the garrisons in the North to the South. It would seem
                    quite rational that garrisons that had been located in one place for eight-ten
                    years be shifted elsewhere just to shake up the routines that had been acquired.
                    But this was in fact not an ordinary move because Southern soldiers, who had no
                    sympathy or understanding of the North, never expected to be removed from their
                    communities. So the redeployment orders were greeted with great consternation
                    and resistance by the southern battalions. In fact, a mutiny broke out, headed
                    by John Garang, who was then a Colonel, a southerner who had done very well in
                    the military. He had been sent to Iowa State where he had earned a Ph.D. in
                    agricultural economics, then was posted in Khartoum and then became commander of
                    one of the battalions in the south. It was Garang's battalion that mutinied.
                    This came as a real shock to his colleagues in the north who viewed him with
                    favor. That mutiny spread throughout the south and, in due course, a full scale
                    civil war ensued. The southern opposition was led by Colonel John Garang who
                    still, eight years later, heads the southern resistance, although I noted
                    recently that some Southern factions have split with Garang. Again tribal
                    rivalries come to the fore. Now the southern resistance movement is
                    fractured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to pursue the question of U.S. assistance in
                        a country split by tribal rivalries. What kind of special problems does that
                        situation present?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: First of all, we have to remember that getting around in the Sudan is
                    very, very difficult. There are very few roads; the internal air transportation
                    system is barely adequate, as is the rail system—the trains are very slow. So
                    getting around was a major problem. The AID mission tried at the beginning, with
                    some success, to post Americans in the hinterlands of the Sudan. It managed to
                    get a few so located, but the support costs of keeping an American family going
                    in such circumstances were quite considerable. The support logistics were
                    extraordinarily complicated. Then there was a problem of the Americans posted in
                    the South being linked to the ministries in Juba, which in turn depended on
                    ministries in Khartoum for their resources. In addition, American technical
                    advisors had to have the support and approval of local officials. It became a
                    very complicated administrative scheme with lots of actors in play.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>In these situations, the shortage of adequately trained local officials became
                    acute. Sudanese would be sent from Khartoum to Juba, but would only stay for
                    brief periods and then be replaced by others. The Americans had no continuing
                    relationships with a permanent Sudanese project manager. These difficulties led
                    me to the conclusion that local technical assistance projects in the rural areas
                    were not viable. I was more interested in moving the AID mission to a policy
                    that would concentrate on the Sudan's macro-economic issues such as increasing
                    privatization of government enterprises and increasing the U.S. commodity import
                    program that would generate local currency for some creative local programs. I
                    wanted a severe reduction in project activities, although a number that were
                    marginally useful I wanted to keep. It was an uphill battle; the AID Director
                    had an enormously difficult task in trying to reshape the program in a difficult
                    environment.</p>
                <p>As I said earlier, we were always concerned about North-South even-handedness and
                    about the West getting a fair share of the assistance program. As strong
                    provincial governors became established, each would lobby Khartoum for his
                    “fair” share of the assistance pie. They would frequently come to see me or the
                    AID Director and we had to pay constant attention to making sure that each of
                    the provinces was given a fair share by Khartoum. Of course, there were other
                    donors who undoubtedly encountered the same pressures: the World Bank, the UNDP,
                    the Scandinavians—especially Norwegians who had sponsored an enormous project in
                    the South which was to provide all of the infrastructure to a wide area—roads,
                    farming tools for that particular soil, seed, extension advice. This was to be a
                    model for development and the Norwegians had made excellent progress. As usual,
                    once the Norwegians left, as they had to because of the civil war, the whole
                    project collapsed because there wasn't anybody to maintain the required impetus
                    or even the roads and the other infrastructure. The churches—Catholics and
                    Episcopalians in particular—were very active. They built schools and provided
                    welfare support, all in the South. The Germans had a large aid program as did
                    the Italians who supported their contractors generously. Italian projects in the
                    Sudan were subsidized by their government—that was the Italian version of
                    assistance. That made for a large Italian presence in the Sudan. The British
                    were also present. A great amount of assistance was going to the Sudan.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>There was also cash support from other Arab countries. Initially, the whole
                    “Sudan bread basket” concept attracted Saudi investments, particularly from some
                    of the Royal family princes. They supported a very large project near the Blue
                    Nile that was a major effort to cultivate a massive rain-fed area. They brought
                    in Australian farm managers, farm equipment, etc. It turned out to be extremely
                    costly and the returns on the investment became more and more distant. The
                    Saudis lost heart, which is not uncharacteristic of Arab investors who were
                    always seeking a fairly quick return. In the agricultural field, particularly
                    when you are starting with virgin territory, you face a lot of problems: soil
                    development, infrastructure construction, etc. All of this takes time and the
                    Saudis became impatient. Furthermore, the “bread basket” concept was overdrawn
                    and exaggerated because the soil contained a lot of clay. The proper preparation
                    of the soil was a problem—getting the right fertilizers and seeds. The soil was
                    not good black loam that could be cultivated easily; it was difficult soil that
                    had to be worked properly before it could be made fertile.</p>
                <p>I was relatively optimistic about the Sudan's future until June, 1983 (my last
                    year in Khartoum). Nimeiri had assured me that the partition of the South into
                    three provinces would not occur. He told me that as an old politician who had
                    followed the course of events in the South closely he had come to the conclusion
                    that partition would engender too much opposition and too great a political
                    upheaval. Despite having given me those assurances, he nevertheless proceeded.
                    It had already been announced that I would be departing; so in the waning days
                    of my tenure, Nimeiri reneged on his assurances and divided the South. That in
                    effect abrogated the Addis Ababa agreement, which ironically was his main
                    achievement. We left in July.</p>
                <p>In September, Nimeiri took the most egregious and foolish action of all in a
                    desperate attempt to maintain power and to keep control; he pronounced Sharia
                    law as the new foundation of Sudanese law. That made the government the vehicle
                    for the dissemination and effectuation of Islamic law; the Sharia became the
                    base for secular law and governance. The early manifestations of this new policy
                    were ugly; Nimeiri set up religious courts which ruled with a heavy hand. There
                    were other signs that he had become a born-again Muslim. At one point, just
                    before my departure as this new thrust was just beginning, I spoke to him about
                    these trends. While noting that it was obviously an internal matter. I felt
                    constrained to point out to Nimeiri that Sudan's was more than one-third
                    non-Muslim people, which might well react violently to imposition of Islamic
                    law. I mentioned that he had, as I had predicted, already caused great unrest by
                    dividing the South into three provinces. He said: “Mr. Ambassador, every person
                    has been given by God a role to perform on earth. You have your role; I have
                    mine. God had decided that I should be the head of my nation. His word is
                    inscribed in the Koran, and I, therefore, take my guidance in helping my people
                    from it.” He viewed himself as a messenger of God. His focus was to be on the
                    south because that area in his view was populated by heathens—only a small
                    proportion, according to him, were Christians; to the rest he would give the
                    benefit of God's word.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>How much of this fundamentalism Nimeiri believed and how much was calculated
                    cynicism, I do not know. It was suggested at the time that he did have some kind
                    of mystical conversion. It also could have been that he was on some medication
                    that may have accounted for his state of mind; he had had back aches and other
                    ailments; he had not been able to sire any children and he did take medication
                    to “make him fertile.” He was the supreme and unchallenged leader of the
                    country; he may well have come to believe sincerely that he had been chosen by
                    God to invoke the Sharia and not to do so would have been a great sacrilege. I
                    think nevertheless in my last days in Khartoum, Nimeiri was becoming irrational,
                    to put it mildly. Whether it was the medication, his over-weaning sense of
                    omniscience, his born-again Islamic fervor, his isolation or whether it was the
                    influence of a newly palace installed Sufi Mullah— a mystic who had a peculiar
                    view of Islamic ways,—I don't know. In addition, his former Attorney General
                    Hassan Turabi, who was the most sophisticated politician in the Sudan,
                    extraordinarily ambitious, a firm believer in Islam and the head of the Muslim
                    Brotherhood, who had broken with Nimeiri earlier, had returned to favor and had
                    become the President's political advisor. I was in contact with him from time to
                    time. It is very difficult to exaggerate how isolated Nimeiri had become. One of
                    his principal conduits with the outside world was a Mr. “Fix It” named Dr. Baha
                    Idris. He was a Ph.D. in one of the physical sciences. He became the controller
                    of the “gate” and in order to see Nimeiri, you had to go through Baha. He was
                    very efficiently able to orchestrate the whole palace. He controlled Nimeiri's
                    schedule and was particularly helpful to us in scheduling visits by Congressmen.
                    Senators, Bud McFarlane, the NSC Advisor, Frank Carlucci, the Deputy Secretary
                    of Defense and others. We had a considerable number of American visitors. Baha
                    was also very helpful in facilitating the dialogue with the Sudanese on the
                    prepositioning of military stocks, which was a very sensitive issue that we kept
                    under wraps as much as possible. He instructed the Sudanese negotiating
                    delegation on Nimeiri's views. As the gate-keeper, he became a very powerful
                    man. Unfortunately, he was essentially a “yes” man, although he could play
                    Nimeiri as an expert violinist can his instrument. It was alleged that he was
                    Mr. 5% or 10%. My predecessor, Don Bergus, told that me that he had a reputation
                    for skimming off some amount from every major investment that was made in the
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p>I should make a point about corruption and related matters in the Sudan. Judged
                    against the practices in other Third World countries, I believe it was rather
                    modest. There was not a great deal of open corruption. The Civil Service,
                    following British traditions, tended to be reasonably efficient and honest,
                    although we knew that there were some games being played on the side all the
                    time. As I mentioned before, the principal graft-recipient was Baha. We could of
                    course never have complete proof, but for example there was a major South Korean
                    investment in which he was obviously involved. There were nefarious activities
                    which gave off strong Baha odors. But Baha was a very important figure and, I
                    must admit, made my life much easier.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I think I have earlier suggested that Nimeiri changed while I was in Khartoum. He
                    became disdainful of the people around him. He came to believe that they didn't
                    have the clarity of mind or the insights that he had; he became more and more
                    convinced that he had become an instrument of God. He had a sense of omniscience
                    and felt that no one else could make the proper decisions. He would not accept
                    any negative views, which was not much of a problem in any case because, by the
                    time Nimeiri had reached this mental state, anyone who in the past might have
                    dared to speak up had been thrown out. Abdul Magid, whom I have mentioned before
                    and who had been the first Vice-President, had at one point, when the military
                    were fed up with Nimeiri's policies, became the steward of a group of senior
                    officers which was discussing whether or not Nimeiri should be relieved of
                    office. It was Magid who persuaded them to continue to support Nimeiri; it was a
                    turning point. In retrospect, Abdul Magid may have made a mistake. It might have
                    been better to let the majority of the generals have their way. It was obvious
                    by that time that Nimeiri was entering his mystical, irrational and nonsensical
                    behavior phase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other actual or potential military plots of
                        which you were aware?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: There were a number of rumors about cabals or plots, but the one I
                    mentioned earlier was the one that came closest to execution; it probably would
                    have been successful. Our intelligence on the military was pretty good; we had a
                    good Military Attach�, we had a small Military Assistance mission. In fact, we
                    knew well what was going on; I think we were the best informed foreign mission
                    in town, and that included the Egyptians, who always viewed the Sudan as a sort
                    of a protectorate. We knew what was happening and had good intelligence on the
                    military.</p>
                <p>So it was a pity that Magid didn't throw the rascal out at the time. The growing
                    mysticism, the isolation, the perceived special relationship to God, all made
                    him more and more desperate in an effort to re-galvanize the support of the
                    Sudan's elite and the military, which he understood he was losing.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I used to see him at least once a week, frequently alone or with Dr. Baha as a
                    note taker. Occasionally, I would take the DCM. Nimeiri used me as a confidante,
                    up to a point. I had established a very comfortable relationship with him. We
                    were major assistance donors and Nimeiri had established close relationships
                    with some Washington people. He had met with President Reagan and Vice-President
                    Bush many times and with the Secretary of Defense and frequently with Bill
                    Casey. He was comfortable with them and with me. I would take it on myself to
                    raise issues that may not have been central to U.S. concerns, but were key to
                    the stability of the country. For example, I strongly opposed the division of
                    the South into three provinces, which was so obviously a mistake. I also talked
                    to him about the treatment that southerners were receiving. I wanted to help him
                    with the problems of decentralization, which he felt important; so we discussed
                    that as well. We of course talked about U.S.-Sudan issues such as the
                    prepositioning of military equipment, events in the Chad, in the OAU and in the
                    U..N. which were of interest to the U.S. Interestingly enough, I rarely saw him
                    socially. On one occasion, he came to our Fourth of July party; that was
                    unprecedented. Once we were invited to his residence, but most of my contacts
                    were during working hours.</p>
                <p>I had not been given any particular briefing on human rights issues when I became
                    Ambassador, but it was quite clear that the issue was high on President Carter's
                    agenda just by the fact that a separate Bureau had been established which
                    produced periodic cable reminders of the importance of human rights in U.S.
                    foreign policy. I did discuss the human rights issue with Nimeiri on a number of
                    occasions. He understood our position, but in those days he had not violated our
                    standards in any major way. It was later, after the invocation of the Sharia,
                    that the violations really started and brought the issue to the forefront of
                    U.S.-Sudan relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became an Ambassador after having spent most of your
                        career in the aid program. Did that create any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: No, it didn't. In fact, in retrospect, I think that all of my prior
                    experiences were ideal preparations for my ambassadorial assignment. I was in a
                    country with a large aid program; I was in a country with sizeable developmental
                    problems; I had managerial and administrative experience. The Sudan Mission was
                    sizeable with all the AID and military assistance personnel and a number of
                    contractors. I never felt that my FSO staff resented my appointment or that it
                    thought I would be unable to perform effectively; that was never an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Sudan when we flew AWACs over Libya. Did
                        that resonate in Khartoum at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>KONTOS: That was just a passing incident which went largely unnoticed, although
                    it was mounted primarily for Nimeiri's benefit to show Qadhafi that he had
                    powerful friends. But we did have a problem when Libyan planes attacked
                    Omdurman. They dropped a couple of bombs in an effort to hit the radio
                    transmitter. That stimulated the Sudanese to mount a counter-attack which never
                    amounted to much. As I mentioned earlier, Qadhafi and Nimeiri hated each other
                    and that is what probably provoked this minor skirmish.</p>
                <p>We were also very active in supporting Chadian troops that were opposing Libyan
                    incursions. We used Sudanese troops to help the Chadians because the border
                    between Darfur—the most western Sudanese province—and Chad was not well defined
                    and border crossings were frequent.</p>
                <p>Being an ambassador is one of the most rewarding positions in the U.S.
                    government. I felt very comfortable in the job. I was able to deal with a broad
                    range of activities which cut across agency lines. I enjoyed the challenge and
                    it was in many ways the highlight of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in September, 1983, you returned to Washington to
                        join the Policy Planning Council, the successor organization to the Policy
                        Planning Staff. What was your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The staff was under the direction of Steve Bosworth. I had two roles: a)
                    I was the Africa (South of the Sahara) man for the Council and b) I looked after
                    U.N. issues. Recently I came across a check list of issues that I addressed
                    during my first six months on the Council, to April 1984.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with the African Bureau, INR, IO and NEA. I wrote, co-authored
                    or revised several papers dealing with:</p>
                <p>1) The Sudan= During those six months, the political, economic and security
                    situations had deteriorated badly. I prepared a number of papers for the
                    Secretary and Larry Eagleburger, then Under Secretary for Political Affairs,
                    describing the growing insurgency and the genesis of the political crisis facing
                    the country. In addition, I was actively engaged in the preparation of papers
                    for the official visit to Washington of President Nimeiri. During his stay, I
                    spent an hour alone with the President, having a frank and useful exchange of
                    views.</p>
                <p>2) Southern Africa= This was an area of major concern. I prepared or collaborated
                    on a number of papers that centered on the stalemate in the negotiations and a
                    strategy for a breakthrough which we were close to achieving.</p>
                <p>3) The Horn of Africa= I participated in a number of reviews conducted to up-date
                    and reassess the policy set forth in NSDM 57 of September 22, 1982. This process
                    culminated in a memo of March 5, 1984 from the NSC which approved a report that
                    had emerged from the review process.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>4) Nigeria= I wrote a commentary on a take-over of the government by the military
                    and what the outlook might be for the future.</p>
                <p>5) Zaire, Kenya, Djibouti= A paper was written on varying aspects of our
                    bilateral relations with these states and emerging problems.</p>
                <p>6) Refugees= I was asked by the Refugee Bureau for my views on a proposal to
                    centralize all refugee operations in AID instead of the State Department.</p>
                <p>7) United Nations= I represented S/P in a working group whose job it was to
                    develop policy to guide the geographic bureaus' preparation of the Secretary's
                    response to a new Congressional requirement that voting records of all members
                    of the U.N. be reviewed and U.S. foreign policy be adjusted accordingly for each
                    country. Despite short notice, the report was completed within the allotted
                    time. I prepared a lengthy paper for Larry Eagleburger which proposed a serious
                    re-look at our role and participation in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.
                    This was at a time when hostile votes in the U.N. sessions were turning many in
                    Congress and the general public towards an anti-UN posture. This was also the
                    setting for our withdrawal from UNESCO, a move which I supported.</p>
                <p>8) Speeches= I prepared a whole new draft of a speech for the Secretary on
                    Africa, much of which was retained in the final version. I also contributed to
                    the preparation of the remarks that were given by the Secretary to an audience
                    of business executives who had an interest in South Africa.</p>
                <p>9) African Economic Policy Initiative= With others in S/P, I participated in a
                    series of meetings and paper writing that moved this idea from a general concept
                    to inclusion in the President's Fiscal year 1985 budget.</p>
                <p>10) I represented S/P outside the Department in conferences and meetings on
                    African issues. I gave talks, participated in panels, workshops, etc.</p>
                <p>11) Quality of Life on the West Bank and Gaza= I worked with Peter Rodman, who
                    succeeded Bosworth as head of S/P and Bill Kirby of NEA in trying to achieve
                    some measure of the mandate from the Secretary to develop ways whereby the U.S.
                    government could contribute to improving the life of Palestinians on the West
                    Bank and Gaza.</p>
                <p>12) General Activities= I arranged with outside scholars and experts to come to
                    S/P to discuss recent developments in Southern Africa, the Horn of Africa and
                    the role of the Soviet Union in Africa. I met informally with African
                    specialists in Washington at local universities, think-tanks and
                    non-governmental voluntary organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>That was a summary of my work-load of a six months period, which I think is
                    representative of what a staff such as S/P does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very interesting because it does give us a better
                        idea of the role that a Secretary's staff performs. You had an opportunity
                        to see Africa from an over-all perspective. What were your impressions of
                        U.S. interests in Africa in general and how much attention did the
                        Department's leadership devote to Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: The Seventh Floor did not see Africa as a major issue, although Chester
                    Crocker, who was the Assistant Secretary for Africa, was considered to be one of
                    the best, if not the best, of the Assistant Secretaries. Therefore his writ and
                    presence and his general advocacy of certain policy positions carried
                    considerable weight. We did have much concern with Southern Africa but Crocker
                    spent, in my view, a disproportionate amount of time on Southern African issues.
                    Those were the ones that involved the Secretary and the Under Secretary. There
                    were wars going on in Ethiopia, there were occasional uprisings in Rwanda, and I
                    think that there was probably a much more active interest in African affairs on
                    the Seventh Floor then than there is now and perhaps earlier, even though it was
                    not a high priority matter.</p>
                <p>Crocker was very good. The Secretary had confidence in him. George Shultz was his
                    great supporter and that allowed Crocker a considerable amount of flexibility,
                    although he was always meticulous in briefing the Secretary and other principals
                    on what he was trying to accomplish.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that I thought too much time was devoted to Southern Africa. I think
                    every ambassador wants his Assistant Secretary to visit his domain. In the
                    course of my three years in the Sudan, I may have had one visit from
                    Crocker—maybe two, but certainly not enough. We in the Horn of Africa felt that
                    our problems—Chad, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, etc—might have attracted a little
                    more attention. But it wasn't a serious problem. Even while I was in S/P, I
                    don't think Crocker spent enough time on other parts of Africa as he might
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will our neglect of many African problems have some
                        negative effects in the future?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>KONTOS: I don't think so. In fact, there may have been a little too much U.S.
                    activism in Africa in the past. The Africans have to sort out their own problems
                    first and decide how they want to deal with them. There should be a period of
                    neutral arms-length distancing by the U.S. which will permit this sorting out
                    process to work. The Africans are going through a major intellectual
                    reconsideration of their policies as they move away from their knee-jerk
                    anti-colonial, anti-private enterprise, anti-open market economy policies which
                    led them to disasters in the past. They need a breathing space to sort things
                    out. They will move, I believe, to more democratic forms of government. The U.S.
                    should stand by and be helpful if called upon, but it should not become active
                    in this reassessment process which the Africans need to conduct by themselves. I
                    am talking about the whole of Africa, not just that south of the Sahara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any problems with private American
                        organizations becoming involved with African democratization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: No, not at all. To the extent that they can establish a legitimate role
                    in African eyes, it is certainly a major asset. But the U.S. government should
                    play a much more modest role and reduce its involvement in such activities as
                    AID programs. That was my view as well when I was in S/P. I found that there was
                    general agreement on that point of view among my colleagues. It was more a
                    matter of degree. For example, in the case of the Sudan, as Nimeiri entered his
                    Sharia phase, I was increasingly in favor of showing our concerns by diminishing
                    our assistance levels and distancing ourselves from our close relationship with
                    him.</p>
                <p>I believe that the process of democratization in black Africa will continue. We
                    have to be patient. In fact, there is very little that outside forces can do,
                    other than being helpful in supplying advice and information when requested. To
                    be engaged actively through large AID programs at a time of reevaluation of how
                    they are going to deal with their internal problems seems to me to be misapplied
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me return to the question of human rights which you
                        have already discussed for the Sudan. Was there a problem of human rights
                        abuses in Africa in general while you were in S/P?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: As a nation, we have upheld the importance of people being treated in a
                    civilized manner consistent with a set of principles that are part of our ethos
                    and tradition and that define us as a country. I have always been very
                    supportive of a strong human rights position in our foreign policy. We should
                    never watch human rights being trampled on without taking a firm stand against
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Before closing this chapter of my career, I might just mention that while I was
                    in S/P, when Bosworth left and Peter Rodman took over, the Council returned to
                    being the Policy Planning Staff. It was during the latter part of my tour in S/P
                    that the Secretary set up an Advisory Committee on South Africa. That consisted
                    of twelve members who were supposed to evaluate, assess and recommend an optimal
                    U.S. policy towards South Africa. The idea came from Secretary Shultz, Deputy
                    Secretary John Whitehead and Chester Crocker. It may well initially have come
                    from the Bureau for African Affairs.</p>
                <p>South Africa was a hot issue, very volatile. There were marches in Washington,
                    with picketing in front of the South African embassy and police arrests. Many
                    editorials were being written. The administration was on the defensive as the
                    concept of “constructive engagement” came into serious question. There were a
                    lot of people, particularly African Americans, who felt that we were not
                    sufficiently concerned about the problem of apartheid. The Advisory Committee
                    was to consist of distinguished and influential Americans, representing various
                    walks of life and sectors. The idea was that this group would spend a year
                    thinking through the problems of South Africa and suggesting possible U.S.
                    responses in support of the voices of freedom and democracy and the elimination
                    of apartheid.</p>
                <p>In part, the reason for the Committee was to diffuse a domestic political
                    problem; in part it was to help shed some new light on ways and means of dealing
                    with an intractable problem. There was the hope that the educational process
                    that was required to bring the twelve Committee members up to speed might shed
                    some new light and that the attendant publicity might be helpful in the
                    education of that sector of the public that was interested in the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Chet Crocker believe that his policy of “constructive
                        engagement” had hit a dead end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: He felt very much on the defensive. The whole concept had been
                    over-simplified by his opponents. He was looked upon, unfairly I think, as one
                    who was trying to work out an apology for the way the South African government
                    was dealing with the issue and as one who was not as tough on that government as
                    some would have wished him to be in pushing for greater freedoms for the
                    majority black population. It was an unfair accusation, but nevertheless it was
                    current. More and more people felt that Crocker had leaned over backwards to
                    permit the minority white government to wiggle its way out of its dilemma. I
                    didn't agree with those perceptions. I felt that on the whole there may have
                    been a major role for the U.S. government to play, but that apartheid was
                    essentially a South African domestic problem that had to be solved. We could be
                    helpful and we should oppose, as we did, an apartheid system, but we could not
                    resolve the issue. All of this was swirling about when the decision was reached
                    to establish the Advisory Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>When I first came to S/P, there were the beginnings of discussions about an
                    embargo, with a major reduction of exports to South Africa and the denial of
                    imports from there. That was very much on the agenda. I was personally very much
                    opposed to the idea of embargoes and of punitive measures because I felt it
                    would harm the very people we were trying to help, namely the black working
                    class, who would be deprived of jobs. We would also drive out the American
                    investment community, which was in the forefront of the movement to bring blacks
                    into supervisory positions, to help improve education and housing and training
                    for them. The Sullivan principles, which were adopted by most American
                    corporations in South Africa, were a major influence on how the whole South
                    African corporate world began to treat its black employees. Every American
                    corporation in South Africa was putting black employees in more increasingly
                    responsible positions; they helped with housing, litigations; they pushed for
                    greater freedoms for their black employees. All of that effort would have been
                    terminated once an embargo was put in effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in S/P, was there any consideration given
                        to placing the issue on the U.N. agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: South Africa had already been expelled from the U.N. That essentially
                    eliminated any U.N. efforts to try to alleviate the problem. But outside the
                    U.N., we discussed the embargo issue with the British, the French, the Germans,
                    the Dutch, the Italians. There was a western European working group with which
                    we were in constant touch as well as the Canadians. We were able to reach a
                    certain level of coordination on such actions as demarches. As we moved, because
                    of Congressional pressure, toward a more coercive and tougher policy, a number
                    of European countries followed us. The Scandinavians were way ahead of us. They
                    had long ago agreed not to deal with the South African government and had in
                    fact agreed to support the ANC. There were ANC representatives in Stockholm.
                    Both the Council of Churches and the Scandinavians supported the ANC
                    financially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me now move to the Advisory Committee period. You were
                        its Executive Director during the 1986-87 period. The very concept of a
                        commission on a substantive issue was if not unparalleled, at least, very
                        novel for the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: Indeed it was. In effect, the Department was saying that it would welcome
                    new ideas and new approaches to this highly volatile and sensitive issue which
                    was of particular concern to the 15% of black American citizens.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The Committee consisted of twelve members. It had two co-chairman: Frank Carey,
                    the recent CEO of IBM and William Coleman, former Secretary of Transport and a
                    distinguished black lawyer. Coleman lived in Washington and Carey in New York.
                    The other members were Dr. Timothy Healy, the President of Georgetown
                    University; Owen Bieber, the head of the UAW, Vernon Jordan, the well-known
                    civil rights leader and former Executive Director of the Urban League; the
                    Reverend Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia pastor; Helene Kaplan, a distinguished
                    lawyer and chairman of the board of the Carnegie Corporation; John Dellenback, a
                    former Congressman from Oregon; Larry Eagleburger, then with Kissinger
                    Associates; Franklin Thomas, another African American and head of the Ford
                    Foundation; Roger Smith, the CEO of General Motors; and Griffin Bell, the former
                    Attorney General under President Carter. I should note that both IBM and GM had
                    investments in South Africa and by coincidence, both corporations withdrew from
                    South Africa while the Committee was in existence—these actions were already in
                    train when the Committee was formed.</p>
                <p>Once the idea of the Committee had been approved, I moved from S/P and became the
                    full time Executive Director. The Panel had already been chosen when I became
                    Executive Director. The membership was chosen by the Secretary and Deputy
                    Secretary John Whitehead with some suggestions from Crocker. As time passed,
                    however, it was Whitehead I dealt with; I really viewed him as my boss. The
                    Committee became his baby. As far as I know, the Secretary and he had no
                    problems in getting acceptances from those asked to serve. The major problem was
                    to get balance on the Committee; it had to have representation from various
                    segments of the American society: business, labor, the black community,
                    academia, women.</p>
                <p>Only a few of the members had knowledge or prior interest in South Africa. Only
                    Franklin Thomas, when he was working with the Rockefeller Foundation, had
                    participated in an in-depth study of South Africa. So he knew a considerable
                    amount. Leon Sullivan, as the author of the Sullivan principles, was
                    knowledgeable. Eagleburger had some background having been an Under Secretary of
                    State; Smith and Carey had been in South Africa while visiting their operations.
                    The rest of the Committee had no first hand knowledge.</p>
                <p>As I said, we had a year to submit a report. We had to organize sessions to bring
                    in experts to testify, we had to have papers written, we had to develop agendas
                    for the Committee's private meetings. At first we met once every two months,
                    then monthly. We had a pretty good attendance record from the membership. We met
                    on the Seventh Floor. I hired a staff, which eventually reached twelve; we were
                    located on K Street—getting space in the Department was impossible. The staff
                    was good; Kent McCormick was my deputy. The staff was primarily State
                    Department, but we had two outside experts on it as well. One was Helen Kitchen
                    from the Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) and Michael
                    Clough, a young African specialist that she had recommended. Ann Miller, my
                    Executive Secretary, came from New York.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>We began with briefings, starting with detailed analyses of the factors that had
                    brought about the current political and economic crisis. We did that primarily
                    with briefing papers. Then we had hearings. We had two sessions which were
                    public; anyone who wished to testify was welcomed. We had a large number of
                    non-governmental organizations and others who presented testimony. Then we had
                    closed hearings during which invited witnesses addressed and exchanged views
                    with the Committee. We had U.S. government officials, European experts,
                    academics, etc.; people who knew South Africa. Of course, we held Committee
                    meetings which were opened to members and staff only during which all day
                    discussions were held. I was very much involved in developing the agenda for the
                    meetings. Typically, we would meet in the morning and for another couple of
                    hours after lunch. The morning session would be devoted to the testimony of
                    various experts; lunch would be a working lunch during which and for a couple of
                    hours afterwards, we would discuss the morning's testimony. That process helped
                    the Committee to begin to focus on certain conclusions. The exchanges were very
                    intense. We kept verbatim accounts of all the meetings. The Committee had access
                    to classified information as well as to the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary.
                    Frequently, the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary attended parts of the
                    meetings. It was a very productive process, in part because the group was
                    willing to work very hard.</p>
                <p>As time passed, obviously the Committee became more familiar with the subject
                    matter and the issues. You could begin to see the members becoming advocates for
                    the positions that their constituencies favored. There was a certain amount of
                    “looking over one's shoulder” although I should hasten to add that there was a
                    surprising amount of amity and concord among the members. We had some problem
                    with the co-chairmen concept. I think in retrospect that was a mistake
                    particularly since they were in separate cities and not always available for
                    consultation. Coleman was in Washington and I did see him frequently. Carey in
                    New York was a little harder to get a hold of. The two personalities were
                    completely different. Coleman was much more reflective, thoughtful, more
                    measured; Carey had been a CEO who had become accustomed to issuing orders which
                    would be followed without question. He was somewhat abrupt and curt in his
                    handling of the group. I tried to manage it so that each co-chairman would
                    preside at alternative sessions. But Carey would often interject his views to
                    Coleman's annoyance. I found Coleman to be a very savvy fellow for whom I came
                    to have a very high regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you to reflect on the process itself. Is it a
                        good process for the determination of U.S. foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>KONTOS: It is a useful device, particularly when you have a situation in which
                    ill-founded concerns dominate a major domestic political issue. A committee is a
                    very useful device with which to educate a wider audience—certainly so far
                    twelve highly influential people and the population at large who may have had
                    access to the testimony and dialogue of the public sessions as well as the final
                    report. But I must admit that this spread of knowledge and the final report may
                    have had a marginal impact on policy development. Had the report been issued
                    earlier, it might have had greater influence. But a few weeks before the report
                    was issued, Congress passed legislation which pretty much anticipated what might
                    have been the Committee's conclusions. So that Congress in fact preempted the
                    Committee, particularly by imposing an embargo on South Africa. The
                    Congressional process just proceeded at its own pace without reference to the
                    existence and the deliberations of the Committee. So we were faced with a
                    resounding Congressional mandate that forced a major exodus of American firms
                    from South Africa. We had asked members of Congress to testify before our
                    Committee, but our chairmen or representatives were not asked to testify at
                    Congressional hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it would have made any difference if some
                        members of Congress had been members of the Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: That was considered, but I can't tell you why it came out the way it did.
                    As I said, I was not privy to the selection process. But I am not sure that
                    inclusion would have made any difference because by the time the Committee was
                    established, Congressional views had already hardened on the issue of embargo.
                    As it ultimately turned out, the Committee also agreed on the embargo, although
                    there had been a serious view on the part of a number of members who thought
                    that any punitive measures against South Africa would be counter-productive,
                    they would create unemployment, they would penalize blacks, they would create
                    greater levels of poverty and they would create a greater sense of defensiveness
                    in the government—it would circle its wagons and strike out against the outside
                    world. But as time passed, and in light of the Congressional action, the mood of
                    the Committee changed so that in the end it came out for approval of the
                    embargo, but with some caveats, such as it should also be adopted by all
                    countries particularly Japan. That proviso was added so that American industry
                    would not be disadvantaged by our own embargo. It was an effort to support
                    greater coordination among the industrialized nations.</p>
                <p>The majority of the Committee agreed to the report. Three members, however,
                    formed a minority; they objected to the recommendations for an embargo. One was
                    Eagleburger, one was John Dellenback and the third was Roger Smith. They thought
                    an embargo was wrong; they felt that the end of apartheid could be hastened, but
                    that a growing black middle class would be harmed and that American investment
                    should not cease, but rather become a model for other investors. They didn't
                    want Afrikaners rewarded because the embargo would force fire sales of assets of
                    those firms departing. In fact the embargo turned out to be a bonanza for a
                    number of South African business men.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Committee react to the Congressional
                        action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KONTOS: It felt that in a way its thunder had been stolen. It was prepared to
                    address the issue of the embargo. The Congressional action took a lot of impact
                    away from the report. I think because it was in fact preempted, the report had a
                    relative small response. The press coverage was fairly meager. During the press
                    conference at the outset of which the Secretary was to introduce the members of
                    the Committee, Don Oberdorfer of the Washington Post asked about the Reagan
                    proposal to have every senior government official take a lie detector test.
                    Shultz said “Over my dead body” and ridiculed the whole idea. That was the next
                    day's headline. The Committee got lost in that flurry of news. The report itself
                    got some coverage, but as I said, not as much as it would have had it not been
                    for the preempting Congressional action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you believe that the report had an impact on the Bureau

                <p>KONTOS: Not really because in part personalities came to the fore. For some
                    reason, which I have yet to understand, Crocker antagonized the members of the
                    Committee. They felt he was talking down to them, that he was being a bit
                    condescending, supercilious; I am not sure what it was because I didn't notice
                    any of that. Crocker, though somewhat austere in his presentations, is very
                    articulate. Somehow he was resented. After two or three occasions, I suggested
                    that Frank Wisner, Crocker's deputy, be sent to represent the Bureau. There were
                    always questions about current policy and questions about the Department's
                    reaction to testimony we had heard. So we frequently had to have someone from
                    the Bureau in attendance and that was not usually Crocker. But Carey and Coleman
                    did develop a dislike for Crocker and that created a reaction in the Bureau.
                    When the report was issued, all the Bureau was interested in was to limit damage
                    so there would not be a complete repudiation of “constructive engagement”—the
                    report had said that it was no longer a viable policy. So there was a growing
                    “we” vs “they” mentality and I found myself acting as intermediary in the last
                    stages of the Committee's life.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The effect of such a report is very subtle. There are all kinds of examples in
                    Great Britain of “Royal Commissions” and we have had reports from various Blue
                    Ribbon groups on a variety of issues. The effectiveness depends on the
                    particular chemistry existing at the time, the timing of the report and on its
                    wisdom and cogency. In general, I believe such commissions are a good idea and
                    it may be wise to establish them more frequently. They are time consuming and
                    expensive; there are staff costs, travel costs—we went to South Africa twice,
                    rentals of space and cost of witnesses. On our first trip to South Africa, we
                    all went separately; we were to meet in Johannesburg. I was asked to accompany
                    Frank Carey; he was accustomed to travel by company jet which of course we
                    didn't have. On his way to South Africa, he wanted to see Mugabe, who can be
                    difficult to deal with. It was my job to arrange this meeting. David Miller was
                    our Ambassador in Zimbabwe; I would call him almost daily. It was a Saturday
                    morning just prior to or departure when I finally heard from Miller that
                    “chances were that Mr. Mugabe would see Mr. Carey, but I can not guarantee it”.
                    So I called Carey immediately; we were to leave that afternoon. I told him what
                    Miller had told me. Carey said :”The hell with that. We are not going! Change
                    the arrangements”. So I told Ann Miller that we had to change all the
                    arrangements. She did and we boarded a Sabena flight out of New York.
                    Fortunately, traffic out of New York was being held up because otherwise I would
                    have missed the Sabena flight. We got on a plane in Brussels, heading for Zaire,
                    and I noticed that the plane was practically empty. When I asked why, I was told
                    that the Belgian government was very unhappy with Zaire because it was not
                    paying its bills on time. Hence some Sabena flights had been canceled but the
                    one which we were on was expected to go to Kinshasa and then on to Johannesburg.
                    Carey is of course in first class; I am back in steerage. Two hours after
                    departure, the captain announced that he had been denied landing or overflight
                    rights in Zaire because the government was upset by the Belgian government's
                    insistence that debts be repaid. So the captain said that he would be landing in
                    the Canary Isles instead. Carey by now is beside himself. We went up to talk to
                    the captain, who wired back to Brussels for instructions. Of course, that was
                    Sunday and no one was at Sabena's headquarters. We landed in the Canary Islands
                    at 3 a.m. Carey held me responsible for the whole mess. Of course, no one knew
                    we were arriving; there were no custom people, no busses, nothing. Finally, we
                    caught a couple of hours of sleep and took off again only to land in
                    Zimbabwe—small world. Miller took us under his wings and explained to Carey that
                    Mugabe would have seen him, but that the meeting was canceled when he decided
                    not to come. So we finally landed in Johannesburg with this furious ex-CEO on my
                    hands. It was a memorable trip.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I should mention that many such crises arose during the Committee's life, which
                    lasted for eighteen months. I always found John Whitehead extremely helpful in
                    those situation. We worked closely together and I enjoyed that relationship.
                    Occasionally, one member or another felt slighted because papers didn't reach
                    him or her on time or something else went amiss. They were all prima donnas, but
                    on the whole, we were able to handle them pretty well. I found the public
                    sessions interesting; a lot of different people testified. Some had very
                    reasoned and comprehensive positions; others were emotional and erratic. The
                    most outrageous and extreme were, of all people, the Quakers—the American
                    Friends Service Committee. They wanted the stiffest possible embargo of every
                    activity with South Africa. Bill Coleman, an African American, kept asking
                    whether that might not lead to increasing black unemployment and misery. The
                    Quakers were very firm; they said that would be a cost that must be borne by
                    them. They were prepared to jettison a whole population to satisfy their
                    particular set of biases. Coleman said to me, sotto voce, :”You know my wife and
                    I have been strong supporters of the American Friends Service Committee, but
                    after this testimony, I think we will withdraw that”.</p>
                <p>After the report was issued in the Spring of 1987, I returned to S/P until my
                    retirement in August. I had a lot of clean up work to do on the Committee's work
                    and follow-up on the implementation of the report. That was my main task for
                    those remaining few months before my retirement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That has been a most interesting career and you gave us a
                        lot of food for future historians. On behalf of the Association, I want to
                        thank you for all the time you have devoted to this oral history.</hi>
