                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 6, 1996. This is an interview with George
                        F. Jones, being done of the behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Let's start at the beginning. Can you
                        tell me when and where you were born, and a bit about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I was born on June 27, 1935, in San Angelo, Texas. My father and my
                    father's father were from Arkansas. Both of them were in state politics in
                    Arkansas; both served first in the State House and then in the State Senate in
                    Arkansas. My father was an attorney, a graduate of one of the first classes at
                    the University of Arkansas Law School. He decided at one point to run for
                    District Attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. Apparently it was a very bitter
                    campaign and he lost it. At that point he decided the heck with Arkansas.
                    [laughter] He left and moved to Texas where he met my mother who was a native
                    Texan and who was teaching school there. He ran for County Judge of Tom Green
                    County and was County Judge at the time that I was born. I spent my first five
                    years there and then began an itinerant career that I guess has never stopped,
                    maybe not until now. [laughter] He served two terms as County Judge and then
                    lost, was elected to a third term, lost again, and decided that he wanted to go
                    back to Arkansas. He tried that for a year, he tried being a farmer, that didn't
                    work out. Certainly my father was not cut out to be a farmer. We went back to
                    Texas for a few months. By then, the fall of 1942, we were in World War II and
                    the U.S. government was expanding and demanding people, so he got a job as an
                    attorney with the War Department, so we all went off to Washington, D. C. From
                    the beginning of 1943 to VJ Day [Victory over Japan] in 1945, we lived in
                    Southeast Washington. My mother worked for the Census Bureau and my father for
                    the War Department. In those days they worked on Saturdays. I remember walking
                    about three miles out to the Census Bureau in Maryland to have lunch with my
                    mother on Saturdays. For a year, fourth grade, I went to a private school in
                    downtown Washington, that required me to take a bus and then change to a trolley
                    car. I still remember vividly going down Pennsylvania Avenue on the trolley car
                    and getting off on 18th Street. Not many eight-year-olds would be permitted to
                    do either of those things in Washington or any other urban area today, but that
                    was another era.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>When the war ended, I remember my father and I were fishing off a pier somewhere
                    on the Chesapeake Bay, and my mother who was in Washington unexpectedly
                    appeared, running out to us on the pier, to say that the war was over. At that
                    point her only thought was to go back to Texas. So we went back to Texas, to
                    Austin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been about 10 years of age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right, I was 10 when we returned to Texas, and I stayed there
                    through high school. I had never expected to go to college anywhere except to
                    the University of Texas, but I saw a poster at my high school about a small
                    college in Indiana that for some reason caught my eye. It was and still is a
                    small men's college in Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the name of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Wabash College, in Crawfordsville, Indiana, population about 13,000 then
                    and it probably hasn't changed much today. The more my mother and I thought
                    about it, the more we liked the idea - but I had to have a scholarship in order
                    to be able to afford it. I got the scholarship and off I went to Wabash. I was
                    very happy with the experience, I've been sold on small liberal arts college
                    ever since. Somewhere about halfway through my time there, a friend of mine and
                    debate partner (he wasn't talking to me, I was overhearing the conversation)
                    said that he was thinking about taking the Foreign Service exam and going into
                    the Foreign Service. That was certainly the first time I ever thought about it,
                    I think it may have even been the first time I had even heard of it. Again, like
                    seeing the poster about the college, for unknown reasons, it piqued my interest,
                    it caught my attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you majoring in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Political Science. As it turned out, I don't know if he ever took the
                    exam, he certainly never went into the Foreign Service. He became a lawyer and
                    went to Wall Street. But I had always been interested in international relations
                    and foreign countries and international travel, even though I had never been
                    outside of the United States. I don't think my parents had either. I got
                    interested in the Foreign Service but I was still unsure. Before that I had been
                    thinking about journalism, I was seriously interested in that. By the time I got
                    to the point, in my senior year, of choosing a graduate school, I had to make a
                    decision. I was looking at a journalism program at Stanford or a pre-Foreign
                    Service program at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Massachusetts. I
                    figured the one I chose was going to determine what career I was going to
                    follow. I chose Fletcher and went off to Fletcher in the fall of 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did it for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Just a year. I think now you have to spend two years to get a Masters, but
                    at that time I just spent a year there. While I was there I took the Foreign
                    Service exam in December of 1955 and passed it. I took the oral exam in April of
                    1956 and was told the famous phrase that we don't tell you whether you pass or
                    fail, we ask you to continue the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to back up just a bit. While you were at Fletcher,
                        this was probably the first place that you were up against the people who
                        were really dealing with diplomatic matters. Did you gain any impression
                        there about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Actually, it was not quite the first experience, because in the summer of
                    1955, right after college, while still at Wabash I had taken what was then
                    called the Junior Management Assistant examination which was a ticket to a civil
                    service career, and had applied for some summer jobs and had gotten one at AID.
                    So I spent three months in Washington, for the first time since 1945, working
                    for AID. I had a very interesting job working in the policy planning and
                    coordination office of AID. I had some very good supervisors who took a lot of
                    pains to encourage me. Definitely I would have stayed with AID if I hadn't
                    passed the Foreign Service exam. So I had some background to go on when I went
                    to Fletcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any of the people that you came across at
                        Fletcher that impressed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think they all impressed me in one way or another. The one I didn't much
                    care for even though he was a considerable name in his field was Ruhl Bartlett
                    who taught Diplomatic History. I didn't like him as a teacher. I also didn't
                    think much of his text book either. Years later at Stanford I met Thomas Bailey
                    who is the bigger name, who was the big name in American diplomatic history, and
                    I liked his book, A Diplomatic History of the American People, much, much
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never met him, but I certainly used Bailey as my
                        textbook. When you took the Foreign Service oral exam, can you think of any
                        of the questions that you were asked, or the atmosphere when you took
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes, it's pretty vividly etched in my memory. [laughter] There were three
                    people on the oral panel, I think only one was an active duty officer, Garland
                    Richardson, who had served in Japan. There was a retired officer and someone
                    else who I think may have been civil service, on the panel. I remember being
                    asked if I smoked and being offered an ashtray, and when I said no, they looked
                    at me very sternly and asked me if I had any other vices. The nearest I came to
                    being caught up, was when I had been going on about the research that I had been
                    doing on West Africa at Fletcher and the Chairman of the panel asked me if I
                    knew what witches broom disease was. I didn't have the faintest idea of what it
                    was but I said that from the context in which we were talking, I would guess
                    that it was a disease of the cacao plant, which turned out to be right. So I got
                    some credit for being a good guesser. The last question was about Mississippi
                    and why race relations were so bad in Mississippi, how would I explain that to a
                    foreigner? I said that one reason was that it was the state in the United States
                    which had the largest percentage of blacks (I probably didn't say blacks at that
                    time) and the other was that it was the poorest state in the United States. So
                    you had the conditions for the most intense competition, economic and political
                    competition, and he seemed very satisfied with that answer and that was it. I
                    was extremely impressed with the written examination, I thought it was the
                    toughest examination I had ever taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the three and a half day one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: This was the one day exam. It was all day, and it was exhaustive and
                    exhausting. I was nervous enough, but I wasn't that impressed with the oral
                    exam. I though the oral exam could have been tougher, maybe in retrospect they
                    had already made up their minds before the oral and it was to some degree
                    proforma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enter the Foreign Service in 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe your entering class? The makeup and the
                        outlook and the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JONES: I was very lucky because it was a time when they were very anxious to
                    recruit and they were taking in substantial numbers of people. I took the oral
                    exam in April, went through the security clearance process, I graduated from
                    Fletcher in late May or early June, I went home to Texas for a month, and got a
                    phone call asking if I could be in Washington in July. So compared to people who
                    had spent years sitting on the register, I was extremely fortunate. I flew to
                    Washington - first class in those days - on July 4, and reported to the Foreign
                    Service Institute on July 5 - but my entrance-on-duty date was always July 4,
                    which I thought very appropriate. I was one week past my 21st birthday, which
                    was the minimum age for entering the Service. The class, the group we were in
                    was a mixture. There were some brand new people like myself coming in and there
                    was also a group that had apparently taken part of the training previously and
                    then gone off and done something else and now were being brought back. So there
                    was a group of older and more experienced officers who were in with us. We also
                    had an unusual experience in that we, the entire July class, were all assigned
                    to the Department, rather than being sent overseas as most entering classes are,
                    apparently due to a shortage of people in Washington. Then a group of us had an
                    even more unusual experience in that, just after the course was over, there must
                    have been 10 or 12 of us who were sent over to the Passport Office. That was a
                    period of slightly warming relations with the Soviet Union and there was a
                    prospect, somebody thought, that we might be able to get some people out of the
                    Soviet Union who had claims to American citizenship. So it was decided on a
                    crash basis that we had to look at these files and determine how many people and
                    precisely which ones had some claim to American citizenship, these people who
                    had been living in the Soviet Union for years and years. The fastest, easiest,
                    source of bodies was to pull people out of the A-100 course, and a group of us
                    were sent over there for approximately six weeks. So my very first working
                    experience with the State Department was adjudicating citizenship cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the passport office? Was this
                        Ruth Shipley's period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think it would have been, yes. I didn't get much feel for it. We were
                    together as a group and we pulled the files and then we read them and wrote up
                    our own recommendation on the basis of zero knowledge as to whether this person
                    seemed to have a claim or not, and then passed the files on to somebody who
                    actually knew what they were doing. We had very little real contact, other than
                    being shown the ropes, we had not much contact with the passport office.</p>

                <p>JONES: I went to the Bureau of Economic Affairs. At that time they had a
                    rotational program and three of us went into that program and the idea was that
                    we would move around to different offices of what was then the E Bureau. It was
                    aimed at addressing the shortage of economists in the Foreign Service. It was
                    somebody's idea that this would force feed the creation of economic officers,
                    that if we had two years of economic experience that might incline some of us to
                    stay in the economic field. In my case it failed, as I suspect it did in every
                    case, except for people who were planning to do economics anyway. [laughter] My
                    first job was working in the commodities division, under a man named Tom
                    Robinson, which was a good experience. Good supervisors, and good people to work
                    with. All of the foreign policy issues relating to commodities, and among other
                    things the PL 480 program, which gave me a lasting fascination with it for my
                    whole career. I still think it was the most ingenious idea that the U.S.
                    Congress has every come up with and unfortunately under-appreciated by the
                    Congress, which has kept cutting it back. I remember a man named Stan Nehmer who
                    was one of the U.S. government's foremost experts on cotton and cotton textiles
                    was in that office and he had me look at a draft piece of legislation that was
                    being proposed in Congress and I actually spotted something that had foreign
                    policy implications in it and that pleased him enormously. Then I went to an
                    office that dealt primarily with AID programs, sort of a liaison between the
                    State Department and AID, an almost totally civil service office. That was a
                    less happy experience, they did not really know what to do with me, or what to
                    expect from a very young officer. Then I went to the Office of the Press Advisor
                    to the Economic Bureau and I got off to a good start and then the officer who
                    was in charge—I forgot now what happened, he was transferred or he was ill, or
                    something, at any rate he disappeared, and for a period of several months I was
                    there by myself. Which is the kind of thing that only happens in the State
                    Department, I don't think there is any other part of the U.S. government where
                    if you happen to be in the right place at the right time, you are just left
                    there and nobody raises a stink about it and nobody asks if this kid has any
                    capability whatsoever to do this job. [laughter] I remember trudging down to the
                    Department on a Saturday morning after a major snowstorm, we announced a PL 480
                    agreement with Poland that morning - why on a Saturday I have no idea - and John
                    Hightower of the Associated Press actually asked me a question. He asked someone
                    where he could find someone who could give him some background on this agreement
                    and they pointed at me and he actually asked me a question. Marquis Childs
                    called up on the phone one day and wanted to know the amount the AID we were
                    giving to some country.</p>

                <p>JONES: I had a ball in that job. I was replaced in it by Harry Bergold who was
                    later our Ambassador in Nicaragua. I remember briefing him when he came in. By
                    that point I was able to tell him quite a bit about the press advisor's job. I
                    went from there into language training. I had wanted to go to Africa because as
                    I mentioned, in graduate school I had done some papers on Africa and had gotten
                    quite interested in Africa. I had asked to take French and the Department looked
                    at the fact that in college I had studied Spanish and nothing else and although
                    they had tested me and found out that I had darn little conversational Spanish,
                    they more or less concluded that I had a start at least in that language and so
                    they assigned me to Spanish. Toward the end of the training we got our
                    assignments and I was assigned to Quito, Ecuador.</p>

                <p>JONES: No. The first day that I walked into the State Department we were met at
                    the door by Max Krebs, who I guess at that time was running the A-100 course,
                    and I will always remember that he asked a series of questions to everybody who
                    came in and one of them was “Are you married?” and I said “No,” and he looked at
                    me with a very stern expression and he said “Get married, otherwise you'll go
                    overseas and you'll marry some foreigner.” Which is exactly what I did.

                </p>
                <p>JONES: From November 1958 to November 1960. That flight, a Pan American flight
                    from Texas (because I went back to visit my mother and take a few days of leave
                    before going) stopped at every capital in between, Mexico City, San Salvador,
                    Guatemala, Panama - a real milk run. I will always remember looking down and
                    thinking that I'm actually outside of the United States, the land down there is
                    foreign.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>JONES: It was very different—I was just in Ecuador last month, and the Ecuador of
                    1958 was very different from what it is today. The Embassy was very different. I
                    was stunned and rightly stunned as it turned out when I got off of the plane to
                    find almost the entire Embassy at the airport to meet me. I discovered later
                    that didn't happen at any of my other posts. There was a kind of feeling then
                    that this was a far off, isolated, backwater of the universe kind of place, and
                    that we all had to hang together. So the DCM and everybody else was out there to
                    meet me. The DCM was Ed Little, a very fine man who was later an Ambassador
                    someplace in Africa. The Ambassador was Christian Ravndal, a man very much from
                    the old school. I remember that he had everybody on the American staff to his
                    residence at Christmas and he read—I can't remember if it was St. Luke, or
                    Dickens, or what, but I remember being cautioned by the Administrative Officer
                    that the last thing that I wanted to do was to be late for that command
                    performance. I was being picked up by another officer and he was late and we
                    both got there late. Fortunately I was able to explain that it was not my fault,
                    but I remember the terror I felt at having done exactly what she had told me not
                    to do. So it was a pretty different kind of Embassy from any Embassy today. And
                    a different country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political economic situation in Ecuador at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was a conservative President, Camilo Ponce Enriquez, and it was a
                    country that had a very turbulent political history, lots of military coups and
                    overthrows. But it seemed at that point to be in a period of stability,
                    temporary as it turned out. The economy very much turned around bananas, this
                    was before oil was discovered. The large landholders were still very politically
                    powerful and the Indians, who were perhaps a quarter of the population were very
                    much out of everything, the economy, politics and everything else. Presidential
                    elections were held in 1960, and again, one of those fortuitous things happened,
                    my boss Tom Rogers, chief of the political section, came down with hepatitis and
                    was out of the office for several months and I was by myself in the political
                    office and got to do almost all of the reporting on the political campaign. It
                    was clear that the Embassy and Washington and most of the elite were hoping that
                    Galo Plaza Lasso would win, he was a large landowner, but one with a social
                    conscience. He was pro-American, somebody that we could easily deal with and get
                    along with. But his opponent was Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra, who was a populist
                    in the great Latin American tradition and it should have been obvious to me, had
                    I had any greater experience or political smarts, that if you had a free vote
                    which you did, that Velasco was going to run all over this aristocrat who
                    hobnobbed with foreign countries. Which is exactly what happened, but I failed
                    to predict it and the message that I wrote on behalf of the Embassy predicting
                    the result was absolutely wrong. I had my first run in with CIA at that point. I
                    had gone around and talked to all of the political leaders...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a position as a political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Another one of those fortuitous things, I was supposed to be in a
                    rotational program, and I had spent about nine months in the economic section,
                    and then I went to political and was supposed to rotate next into the Consular
                    Section to stamp visas. But then Tom Rogers got sick and they decided they
                    couldn't rotate me out of there and so I spent the rest of the two years in
                    political. Never got to Consular, I'm one of the few foreign service officers
                    never to have had a consular assignment in my whole career. So I went around and
                    I talked to all of the political leaders and each one said his own party was
                    going to win and that wasn't very helpful. If I were doing it today, I would do
                    it very differently, but at that point I didn't know of anything better to do, I
                    thought I would go around and talk to other people in the Embassy who had been
                    there a lot longer than I had, and had been in the Foreign Service a lot longer
                    than I had, and see what they thought. One of the people I talked to was the
                    station chief and he said that it looked pretty close, about 50 -50 and that
                    Plaza seemed to be gaining. That sort of confirmed what other people were saying
                    and so that's what I wrote. Then in a staff meeting after the election, we were
                    all sitting there stunned at Velasco's unforeseen landslide, and the station
                    chief blandly denied that he had said any such thing. [laughter] That was the
                    first, but not the last time, that I was absolutely furious at an Embassy staff
                    meeting. Ed Little had to shut me up and calm me down.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might put in for the record that one of the things in a
                        political section of an Embassy, one of the things that you try to do is
                        gain points back in Washington by saying that you called the election
                        correctly. If you don't call it correctly, your other prognostications, or
                        your record is somewhat blotted. How about the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I always thought —I guess starting from that experience, that that is
                    actually a very bad standard. The only way to tell what the likely outcome of an
                    honest election is, is if you have a good reliable polling service, and not
                    always then, as 1948 proved in the United States. Back at that time there was no
                    such thing in Ecuador, there were no polls of any kind. It's either extremely
                    easy for an Embassy because it tells Washington what the local polls are saying,
                    or else it's extremely difficult, like reading entrails — how is an Embassy
                    supposed to know how voters in a foreign country are going to vote. In Chile in
                    1988, where we had far better contacts and sources of information than we had in
                    Ecuador in 1960, polls were not permitted by the dictatorship, and we had no
                    idea how the plebiscite would go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: He was there almost the whole time. I think about a month before I left,
                    Maurice Bernbaum came in.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JONES: Ravndal was very much old school, very formal, and distant from his staff.
                    He was on Mount Olympus and the only direct human contact was with the DCM. The
                    DCM is often the bridge in an Embassy, even today, between the Ambassador and
                    the rest of the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Ecuadorian society, we're talking about in
                        the 1950's and these things have changed, (I never served in Latin America)
                        but one of the criticisms laid on, in many areas of the world is, an Embassy
                        tends to associate with the ruling class and gets absorbed in that and often
                        isn't very sensitive to what else is happening. You were the new boy on the
                        block, how did you observe the Embassy, its contacts and where it stood in
                        the society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I've always felt that accusation was unfair. The places where I was, my
                    whole career, the Embassy was doing its damnedest to have as wide a circle of
                    contacts as it possibly could. I was never told in my entire career — with one
                    single exception, there was a period when you were warned not have any contact
                    with the local communist party, there was a belief, rightly or wrongly, that if
                    the U.S. Embassy had any contact with the communist party it would lend it
                    prestige and credibility that we didn't want it to have. With that one exception
                    I never ran into any effort to limit contact with the opposition or to limit
                    contact to one level of people or whatever. I think part of the reason that gets
                    said is that people don't understand that it's the primary function of an
                    Embassy to have a relationship with the people who are in power. The thing that
                    you've got to do first, your top priority is to have frequent and close contact
                    with the government and the people who are behind the government and who may
                    influence the government. Because they are the only people who can decide things
                    the way you want them to go. But as I said, every Embassy I ever served in, also
                    tried to have contact with youth, with labor, with journalists, with every other
                    sector of society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about with the Indians? You said that they had about
                        a quarter of the population, I would think that this would have been a
                        difficult group to make contact with. For one thing were they out in the
                        forest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: In the interior of the country yes, largely. Although we also saw many
                    Indians in the streets of Quito as well. It's true, we had very little
                    relationship with the Indians. There was nobody in the Embassy who could speak
                    any of the Indian languages and in defense of that, precisely because they had
                    no role in the system, no influence on the system, it was a very low priority
                    for us. Now today, particularly in this last election that took place this year,
                    there is a block of Indian members of Congress. There was even talk of electing
                    one of them as president of the Congress, which is an extraordinary development.
                    So if I were in the Embassy in Quito today, having contact with representatives
                    of the Indian movement and knowing what they were thinking and saying would
                    certainly be a priority for the Embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find moving within the Ecuadorian society? I
                        notice that your wife is from Ecuador, so I assume that there was at least a
                        contact there. [laughter] How did you find things to be at the social level
                        for a young officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Easy to do. Ecuadorians are very friendly, open people. Latins in general
                    are, with a few exceptions. I found them extremely hospitable toward a young
                    American. You gradually learned that there were ways of doing things. One of the
                    interesting things about a foreign language is it's not just that you translate
                    a phrase into another language, but the way things are said and the way things
                    are put, reflect the whole culture and a way of looking at the world. So along
                    with learning Spanish I also learned something about the way people relate to
                    each other in a Latin culture. Like every culture it's different, it's unique,
                    and it has unique characteristics. I enjoyed it. One reason that I kept going
                    back to Latin America is that I liked the area and I liked the people. I liked
                    the fact that you could go to another Latin country and although there were
                    significant differences from one to another, it was also very familiar because
                    the cultural background was there. It wasn't like going to a totally strange
                    country, there was a large element of familiarity every time you changed
                    posts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were Americans perceived in Ecuador? We had early on,
                        but not too far away, a real dust up in Bogota, when Marshall was
                        there—Nixon came through and had a very difficult time. This was not a
                        completely tranquil time and Ecuador was not Colombia, but it is still up in
                        that area. How was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Nixon had been through Quito on that same trip, that was before I got
                    there. As I recall Quito was one of the places where it went better for him than
                    it had elsewhere. When I was in Chile years later, a couple of friends and
                    contacts of mine published a book called Chile and the United States - Una
                    Relacion Esquiva and both I and my Chilean friends spent some time debating
                    exactly what the best translation of the word Esquiva was, but we came down with
                    ambiguous as the closest to it, an ambiguous relationship. I would say that's
                    not just true of Chile, but of Latin America in general. There is a strong
                    sense, which has grown in the time that I've been familiar with it, that the
                    United States is the most important country for Latin America. It didn't used to
                    be.</p>

                <p>JONES: I remember when Douglas Dillon came down after Velasco Ibarra was elected
                    President, I was asked to go to their lunch and sit behind them and be available
                    as an interpreter. It turned out that they didn't need an interpreter because
                    they could both speak in French. For any Latin American of Velasco Ibarra's
                    generation, knowing French was the natural and expected thing to do. The whole
                    cultural outlook and sense of affinity was toward Europe. And a lot of the
                    economic relationship, certainly before World War II, was overwhelmingly with
                    Europe. It only changed with the destruction of the European economy during the
                    war. That has gradually faded, the overwhelming choice of language, of place to
                    study, now for Latin Americans is the United States. The overwhelming number one
                    trade partner is the United States. For a lot of Latins in the nearer countries,
                    those with a lot of money or even not so much, THE place to shop is Miami. Q: At
                    the time we're talking about it was still in the transitional period?</p>
                <p>JONES: Oh yes, still in a transitional state. But think even then there was an
                    awareness that the United States was a very important country for Ecuador and
                    good relations with the United States were important. But they didn't like a lot
                    of things about us. As I've been suggesting, a lot of the relationship was
                    unavoidable, was essential, they had to trade with the United States because the
                    economy of Europe was destroyed and the United States is closer. Anything you
                    have to do that you don't have any choice about, you tend not to be very happy
                    about. There was a lot of unhappiness with the lack of choice in the
                    relationship with the United States. Of course this was particularly felt on the
                    left. There were people on the right who were unhappy about it too, for somewhat
                    different reasons. The left didn't like the United States policy, its economy,
                    and saw correctly that U.S. influence was exporting our political system, our
                    economy, and that with every day that passed they would have less choice about
                    being carbon copies of the United States, as they saw it. So there was certainly
                    resentment. I felt very little of that in a personal sense. I think that's maybe
                    one thing that I liked about Latin America, obviously there are some exceptions,
                    but with most Latins, they can be violently opposed to your policies and make a
                    furious speech about the United States and then sit down and have a very
                    courteous conversation with you. The tradition of manners that you must have in
                    dealing with another person, and that you can have a warm and friendly
                    relationship even with an opponent, is dominant. It always has been I think.</p>

                        keep the two from squabbling with each other, we acted as a guarantor and it
                        has come back to haunt us again and again. Did that come up at all while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>JONES: I spent a good chunk of my career working on border disputes. Because
                    Latin America is full of them. Ecuador/Peru, Venezuela/Guyana (twice from both
                    sides of the border) and Guatemala/Belize. That's a good illustration of the
                    ambiguity. There certainly were lots of Ecuadorians—every Ecuadorian bitterly
                    resents the loss of land to Peru. Peru was the aggressor, there is absolutely no
                    historical question about that, and it got to keep the fruits of its aggression.
                    The treaty of Rio de Janeiro ratified its gains and a lot of pressure was put on
                    the Ecuadorian government to sign the treaty because we were just getting
                    involved in World War II and we didn't want problems on our southern front.
                    Informed Ecuadorians were aware of that and resented the U.S. role but at the
                    same time they also knew that if anything was ever going to be done about it, if
                    there was ever to be any modification of the treaty, any rectification of the
                    wrongs, they would have to have the United States on board in order to do it. It
                    really wasn't possible for them to be antagonistic to the United States over the
                    border issue because what they had to be was persuasive. The open hostility was
                    mainly toward Peru and in the fifty years since there have been repeated border
                    incidents between Ecuador and Peru and the United States as one of the guarantor
                    countries of the Rio Treaty has had to become involved in every single one of
                    them.</p>

                <p>JONES: I don't think so, not that I recall during the period that I was there.
                    The main events of that period were the border situation which was perpetually
                    threatening to heat up, and the lead-up to the elections in 1960. There was
                    supposed to have been an Inter- American conference of the OAS in Quito in 1960
                    which got called off. I can't remember now why it was called off—maybe due to
                    the border problem, it seems to me that Peru was threatening not to attend if it
                    was held in Quito. They built a new building to host the conference which never
                    occurred.</p>

                    the Department considered it and considered your future spouse and decided

                <p>JONES: Yes, we took a Grace Line ship back to the United States. My one and only
                    shipboard travel at the U.S. government's expense. The Grace Line was still
                    operating what were largely banana boats from the west coast of South America,
                    to the States. They had room on them for a few passengers, about a dozen. We
                    took a ship from Guayaquil to New York. It was a fun experience, even in spite
                    of getting seasick, and my wife was pregnant at the time, so that didn't make it
                    any easier on her. The food was great. Going through the Panama Canal was

                    wife that if she married me, that was what I was going to try to do. The
                    assignment came through and I was told that if I wanted to go to Africa, the
                    only opening was as General Services Officer in Accra, Ghana. This of course was
                    back before the days of open assignments and so I had to take the Department's
                    word for it that this was the only opening. So it was either take what they
                    offered or give up on Africa. So off we went to Ghana, in February 1961.</p>

                <p>JONES: Until February 1963, two years. Ghana was an interesting country, I'm glad
                    I went there. The general services work was certainly different. If nothing
                    else, it gave me sympathy for Administrative Officers and GSO's that I would not
                    otherwise have had. The impatience of people with administrative support and
                    their concept of the level of support to which they are entitled were a
                    revelation to me. [laughter] It was not the work I would have chosen, and I
                    certainly wouldn't have chosen to have done it again, but it was survivable for
                    two years. It really was a learning experience.</p>

                <p>JONES: When I first got there it was a career officer named Russell, I think. But
                    he was not there for very long before we got a political appointee. Kennedy was
                    coming in as President and named a democrat named Mahoney as Ambassador, he was
                    from Arizona or New Mexico. The thing that most impacted on me as GSO, was that
                    we were informed that he was coming with seven children. He was a young man,
                    couldn't have been more than in his forties. The little residence that we had in
                    Accra was in no way equipped to house a family of nine. So a major project for
                    General Services was renovations and expansion. I don't know exactly what we
                    did, but somehow additional space was added to the house. I will say this, the
                    Ambassador was a very nice guy, and very interested in making the very best of
                    impressions. He never complained, we never had any difficulty in dealing with
                    the Ambassador. We had a lot more difficulty with the people lower down the food
                    chain, than we did with him.</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes. I'll never forget, once the Ambassador very solemnly in a staff
                    meeting said that he understood that there were some members of the American
                    community—one of Nkrumah's title's of which he was most fond, was “Osaygefo”,
                    which I was told meant roughly the redeemer, and the Ambassador announced that
                    he understood that there were some people and some younger members of the
                    American community who had been heard referring to him as “old soggy shoes,” and
                    he wanted people to know that we had diplomatic relations with the government
                    Ghana and this was improper conduct. [laughter]</p>

                        of the leader in Africa that people were looking at. What was your
                        impression—was the Embassy sort of starry-eyed about Nkrumah did you think?
                        What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: At that time they were not starry-eyed about him, I've forgotten exactly
                    the period his administration was, but already they were worried about him. It
                    was already clear that he was taking Ghana in directions that we were unhappy
                    about, both politically and economically. He was moving in the direction of a
                    one-man dictatorship, and slowly squeezing the capitalist side of the economy
                    until it expired. But these trends had not fully developed yet, it was more a
                    constant concern than it was a feeling that the war had already been lost. As
                    you said, this was kind of at the peak of the Kennedy administration's approach,
                    that we want to be on the side of the developing countries. Chester Bowles and
                    John Galbraith were sent out to India and the whole object was to have the very
                    best relations with the developing countries, not to nit-pick at them. One of my
                    interesting experiences was the arrival of the very first Peace Corps
                    volunteers, anywhere in the world, to Ghana. I was there at the airport when
                    they came in. My role was to get their baggage off of the plane [laughter] and
                    get it to the Embassy. Nevertheless I was there at that interesting moment.</p>

                    than it is today. Whether they are using a different selection process today or
                    whether the younger generation has matured, but there seems to be a greater
                    awareness now of the fact that they can't raise waves in the local society or
                    they'll soon be back on the plane headed home.</p>

                        ability to compete jobs, etc. What was your impression of how the system
                        worked in Ghana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Our most familiar experience was being victims of extortion by landlords.
                    My major preoccupation was with housing, finding housing for people. It made me
                    a life-long enemy of government-provided housing. My experience has always been
                    that it is easier and works much better if you let people go out and lease their
                    own quarters. Then they can put up with the consequences of their own decisions.
                    Ghana was a totally government-owned and government-leased post, which meant
                    that me, the poor GSO, was responsible for finding everyone their ideal dream
                    house. And if it wasn't available on the local market or available within the
                    guidelines set down by the Department for what we could pay, then it was
                    personally my fault. I needed to look a little harder or work a little harder.
                    Certainly the landlords—they knew it was a tight housing market and that
                    European style and American style housing was hard to find, and we paid enormous
                    rents (it seemed to me at that time) for housing that was not all that good. I
                    don't think we ever had any problem with running into fraud or corruption.</p>

                    hepatitis. I fascinated my doctor in Austin, he hadn't seen many cases and he
                    was just enchanted with the chance to treat a case. [laughter] In the summer of
                    1963, I went to Caracas, Venezuela as Political Officer. There were actually,
                    counting the labor attach�, four regular officers in the political section and
                    then there was a rotating intern, and I was the junior of the four regular

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: When I first got there it was Allan Stewart who spent most of his life as
                    a journalist. He was not exactly a political appointee, I think he had laterally
                    entered the Foreign Service in some way, but by profession he was really a
                    newsman. He was a terrific guy and got along very well with Romulo Betancourt
                    who was then the President. I think I was under Stewart for a year and then he
                    was replaced by Maurice Bernbaum who I had served under briefly in Ecuador.
                    Bernbaum was a 100% career professional diplomat. He was very good at his job.
                    It was a very interesting period because the Perez Jimenez dictatorship had been
                    overthrown at the beginning of 1958, and Betancourt had been elected in December
                    1958, so it was just coming to the end of his administration and then Raul Leoni
                    was elected in December 1963. Betancourt was one of the great political leaders
                    of Latin America, and someone who deserves a lot of credit for both leading the
                    opposition to the dictatorship and for helping lead his country back to
                    democracy afterwards. He served two terms as President and founded the Accion
                    Democratica party, which is now somewhat tattered, but was then one of the
                    bright, shining lights among the political parties of Latin America, a moderate
                    social democratic party which gave some real hope of change in Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a political officer, how did you get out and
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>JONES: I always found it extremely easy to make friends and contacts in Latin
                    America. It was more of a problem finding time to see and talk to all of the
                    people that you wanted to see and talk to. There was no problem with access,
                    there was a problem with time. The language certainly helped, I think being an
                    American diplomat also helped. Doors tended to be open to someone representing
                    the United States, because of who and what the United States is. I had a lot of
                    fun being a political officer in Venezuela. The politics were interesting, it
                    was a hopeful era, and there was a feeling that we were witnessing the settling
                    of the bases of democracy, which we were. It didn't turn out to be 100%
                    successful, but I guess it never does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that the Embassy and you
                        concentrated on in the normal relationship between Venezuela and the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, certainly from the perspective of Washington, the overwhelmingly
                    important issue was the communist threat. There was a guerrilla movement out in
                    the mountains and this was the period when interest and focus on guerrilla
                    movements was at its height. The question of whether it was possible, after
                    China and Malaysia, to defeat a guerrilla movement and if so, how, was of
                    tremendous interest to foreign policy professionals and scholars and soldiers
                    and observers. The guerrilla struggle was mostly out in the remote interior, but
                    there was also some urban terrorism that was taking place. The only time I ever
                    got shot at in my life was when the Embassy was shot at one day. I was in the
                    Embassy but fortunately not in my own office and when the sniper fire began we
                    were discouraged from going back to our offices, but after it was all over and
                    we did go back, I found a bullet hole in the wall, not too far from where my
                    head would have been had I been sitting at my desk. So I was happy I wasn't.
                    This was also the time when the Cubans landed some people and some arms on the
                    coast of Venezuela, and the boat was found and this was the primary piece of
                    evidence in expelling Cuba from the OAS, for the attempt it was making to
                    subvert Venezuelan democracy. It was an interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you as a political officer, and the people you talked
                        to, find that the Venezuelans were supportive of the United States? In Latin
                        America at that point, our main thing was sort of against Cuba. We had
                        already had the missile crisis, that was in 1962, that sort of thing. How
                        did you find the reaction towards the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There were certainly those who disagreed with U.S. policy and there were
                    some who wanted a softer line toward Cuba. But there weren't many among the
                    political leadership in Venezuela, which was a product of several things. Number
                    one was the fact that they had a very obvious communist attempt to subvert their
                    system going on all of the time, so it was hard to be a sympathizer with that.
                    It was hard to sympathize with Cuba when it's landing arms on your coast to help
                    overthrow the democratically-elected government.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Secondly, the AD Party had its experience with the communists back in the 1930's
                    and 1940's. Betancourt and the other leaders of the party—there was a time when
                    they were allied with the communists, or working with the communists against the
                    dictatorships in Venezuela, but he realized that their ultimate objectives were
                    different and broke with them. And as a consequence he and his colleagues in AD
                    were vaccinated against communism in a way that other political leaders
                    elsewhere in Latin America who hadn't had that experience were not. The other
                    major party, the Social Christians, COPEI, came out of conservative Catholic
                    roots, so with neither of the major parties did we have any real problem on the
                    issue of dealing with communism.</p>
                <p>The third factor was the fact that the U.S. was so clearly supporting the return
                    of democracy in Venezuela. There was a visit by Robert Kennedy while I was there
                    that drew just huge crowds. There's an adulation for the Kennedys in Latin
                    America, still today, which I don't think any American really understands. They
                    struck a chord in Latin America, they did here too of course, but it went deeper
                    and lasted longer than it did here. Part of that was because of the Kennedy
                    administration's policies toward Latin America, support for democracy, the
                    Alliance for Progress, and that built a warmth of relations with the United
                    States that put us in good standing for years to come.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did oil politics intrude at all into the political field
                        where you were dealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oil has always been (since 1917 when it was discovered in Venezuela) a
                    major component of our relations with Venezuela. It's the only Embassy that I
                    ever served in that had a petroleum attach� and he was a very key officer. At
                    the time I was there, it was a relatively quiet issue. Later on the Venezuelans
                    nationalized the major American companies and obviously at the time that was
                    going on it was a much hotter issue. It was certainly an issue, there were
                    issues like the debates over how much foreign oil should be admitted into the
                    United States, debates in the United States over that and debates in Venezuela
                    over why they should be dependent on the U.S. market, whether they should try to
                    diversify their buyers, and certainly it was an issue in dealing with the
                    political leaders, especially the young political leaders, who would ask the
                    young officers in the Embassy, are the foreign companies exploiting Venezuela,
                    are there huge profits being made, are we getting paid our fair share for the
                    oil, etc. Those were constant themes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As political officer you're always concerned about what
                        the media is saying, what was your impression of the press, the radio, and
                        the T.V.,in Venezuela at the time that you were there? Particularly from our

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>JONES: I didn't have much to do with the media at that stage in my career, I did
                    later on. The local media of course, is extremely important to any political
                    officer. I remember once in Caracas we had a group of Peace Corps volunteers
                    over to our house and we were sitting around talking and one of them asked me
                    where I got the information that I used in political reporting and I told him
                    from the newspapers. He clearly did not believe me, he thought I had super
                    secret inside sources. The newspaper is what any political officer starts with
                    first thing in the morning. In any country, they almost never tell you 100% of
                    the truth, or 100% of what is going on. But there is almost nothing that happens
                    that doesn't show up in the papers in some form, there is a hint at least that
                    something is going on. Which alerts you to the fact that you need to go and talk
                    to Joe Blow in party X who can tell you more about what the newspapers are
                    hinting at. It's often much more than that if the press is any good, and by in
                    large in Venezuela it was, then you get a tremendous amount of information from
                    the local press.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The United States during this period was undergoing a lot
                        of racial tension. This was the height of the civil rights movement, and the
                        activity there. How did this play in Venezuela? Did they pay much attention
                        to what we were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It was one of the standard issues that would get brought up, especially by
                    anyone a little to the left of the spectrum, race relations in the United States
                    and why do you have such an appalling record on them? As a representative of the
                    United States, you spent a lot of time defending your country, defending things
                    that the U.S. government does, things the U.S. government says, the positions it
                    takes, but also the more fundamental things about the society, defending them
                    and trying to explain them. I don't remember particularly—I think if I had been
                    working as a political officer in Africa I would have gotten a lot more of that.
                    Not as much of that in Latin America. When you did get it in Latin
                    America—particularly if you were talking with someone in the upper class, the
                    people that held power in the society, you were often conscious of how
                    hypocritical that was, because most of these countries have severe racial
                    problems themselves. They are very, very, reluctant to admit it. It is always
                    something that occurs in the United States, but it doesn't occur in their
                    country.</p>

                        to the United States, did you find that Venezuela ever looked to
                        Mexico?</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JONES: At that time the idea of alliances between political parties in Latin
                    America was a very hot topic. AD was a member of the Socialist International and
                    there were a lot of personal relationships that had been forged during the
                    period when many of the political leaders of Latin America were in exile,
                    between like-minded people, social democrats, the Venezuelans, Luis Mu�oz Marin
                    in Puerto Rico, and Jose Figueres in Costa Rica, and the PRI in Mexico to some
                    extent was part of that. The alliances between the like-minded social democrats
                    of these countries, on the one hand. And on the other, the Christian Democrats
                    were just coming to be known and recognized in Latin America. The Christian
                    Democratic party in Venezuela had established itself as the leading opposition
                    party. It was clear that it might someday come to power, as in fact it later did
                    in Venezuela. It had ties with the Christian Democrats in Chile and there were
                    other Christian Democratic movements in Latin America that looked like someday
                    they might come to power and they had links with the Christian Democrats in
                    Europe. We did some reporting on those links. But Mexico for one thing, has
                    never had much of a diplomatic service. I hope my friends in the Mexican
                    diplomatic service will forgive my saying that. The premier diplomatic service
                    in Latin America is today and always has been the Brazilian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: It's a very aristocratic and upper class service. They know their business
                    and it's a real career. They are trained and brought along during their careers.
                    The Brazilian diplomat anywhere, certainly in Latin America and I suspect around
                    the world is always—if you want to find a fellow diplomat who is well informed,
                    you can count on the Brazilians. More I think, than almost any other country. So
                    the Brazilians are influential throughout Latin America simply because of the
                    quality of their people and the amount of work they put into it.When we were in
                    Chile, the Argentine Embassy had a very strong interest in Chile. They were very
                    effective and very knowledgeable while we were there. The Mexicans have very
                    good people in Washington, but they just don't have much of a presence or an
                    influence in South America—I guess another way to put it is that they didn't
                    have much of an interest—they haven't recognized that they have much of an
                    interest, certainly south of Panama. In Central America they do recognize they
                    have an interest and have pursued a more activist stance. Although I don't think
                    they have been terribly effective in Central America.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: The church is very important in Latin America as a whole. I'm trying to
                    remember if it had any particular role in Venezuela. I don't at the moment
                    remember. I remember that we looked at that and tried to develop some
                    information on the role of the church without much success. It did not seem to
                    be playing much of a role there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: We had a full time labor attach�, and in Venezuela, as we had in Ecuador.
                    I never did a lot of labor reporting. Some of the labor leaders in Venezuela
                    were also major political leaders. The AD Party had very powerful labor roots.
                    So to that extent I was involved with the labor movement, but not much beyond
                    that.</p>

                <p>JONES: I had applied for a year at a university. The policy at that time was
                    after you had two overseas tours in the same geographic area you could apply for
                    university studies in that area. Since I had had two tours in Latin America, I
                    applied for Latin American studies. I was given a list to chose from and I asked
                    for Stanford, and I got Stanford. So we went off to live in California for a
                    year.</p>

                <p>JONES: I enjoyed it very much. I think it was a very good break from the career.
                    I think it was hard on my family, we had three small children at that point. The
                    youngest was just a year old. We had to pick up and move all of our furniture
                    and clothing, everything, from Venezuela to California and then a year later
                    from California to Washington. It was a year in which my family didn't see a lot
                    of me because I was studying a lot of the time. But it was a very rewarding
                    year. Stanford had exactly the kind of program I wanted to be in, which was an
                    inter-disciplinary Latin American studies program that was not run out of any
                    department, but run separately. It even had its own building called Bolivar
                    House, where the people in the program met once a week for a core seminar. John
                    Johnson ran the program, he was a person that I had not known previously, but
                    came to admire greatly. I think his work on the middle class and the military in
                    Latin America broke important ground, and his reputation still stands in Latin
                    American studies. I also had the opportunity—although I didn't work with him in
                    course work, I got to know Tom Bailey, the diplomatic historian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Right, and he was working on a new book at that point, The Art of
                    Diplomacy, and when he found out that I was in the Foreign Service he asked me
                    to read it and make comments on it. I remember that he took every suggestion
                    that I made, except for one. I noted that he kept saying former Ambassador all
                    the way through it, and I told him that we in the service liked to think that
                    there wasn't such a thing as a former Ambassador, you were always an Ambassador.
                    But he didn't buy that. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This of course was the Johnson era, and we were getting
                        more and more involved in Vietnam, but there was still the emphasis in Latin
                        America on the Alliance of Progress. How was the Alliance of Progress and
                        how were things going in Latin America as far as government policy was
                        concerned, viewed from the academic perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The student body was certainly absorbed with Vietnam and that was the
                    foreign policy issue. I participated in a debate on it in which I had very few
                    sympathizers. In fact, I recall being taken aback by the degree of far left
                    sentiment on campus. Not that it was a majority sentiment by any means, but it
                    was a little strange to find it at all, coming out of an Embassy environment
                    where there hadn't been any. I suppose I was out of touch, and it was good that
                    I was having this re-exposure to American society, because I was surprised that
                    there were people who were very sympathetic to the Viet Cong and wanted their
                    cause to triumph. There was even a student in our Latin American program who
                    really wanted the far left to triumph in Latin America. That took some getting
                    used to, moving from a 100% patriotic environment to one in which there were no
                    holds barred.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>At that point there was not yet the questioning of the Alliance of Progress as
                    such. I think interestingly, I ran into the real questioning of the Alliance of
                    Progress a couple of years later back in Washington when a group of FSO's got
                    together and started talking about Latin American policy, and began to really
                    question how we were approaching foreign aid. During the year I was at Stanford,
                    there was skepticism about American intentions and the reality of the Soviet
                    threat, and foreshadowings of what was to come later, skepticism of the truth of
                    what was said to them by their government. I remember in one class, in fact it
                    was under Dr. Johnson, that there was a textbook which had a footnote in it
                    about a U.S. military base having been built in Venezuela and I was first of all
                    outraged that a supposedly serious scholar could have printed such a footnote
                    which he sourced to some Latin American publication, without ever checking it.
                    It was obviously untrue, no such base had ever existed. I was equally upset that
                    the professor wasn't disposed as a result of this to toss the book out the
                    window. [laughter] Which was my instinct, if the guy had so little scholarly
                    credentials as that, then why use his book at all. Irving Horowitz was the
                    author. I remember also horrifying Johnson once when we were talking about FBIS
                    and he had apparently never realized that FBIS was a subsidiary of the CIA. Of
                    course he like most professors relied heavily on FBIS reports for sources of
                    news of what was going on overseas. [laughter] He was horrified to discover that
                    here he was using a CIA publication.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to step back from the day to day pressures of covering foreign
                    political situations and doing reporting telegrams, to look at intellectual
                    concepts of how countries develop and how their politics is organized. During
                    that period I read Charles Anderson's book in which he puts forth the concept of
                    power contenders—that there are labor unions, and political parties, and there
                    is the military and there is the church and there are all of these other groups
                    who are competing for power and they demonstrate their power in various ways. I
                    found that immediately connected with my foreign service experience and I
                    realized that he was exactly right, this is exactly the way it works and that
                    was a very useful way to think about it .</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes, it came up but it was overshadowed by Vietnam at that point. It
                    wasn't that much of an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you being used sort of, with the professors like
                        Johnson saying, “Now let's hear from our State Department representative”?
                        Was it perfectly natural being used as a source to the students so that they
                        would get a slightly different perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>JONES: No, not much. There was the occasional small opportunity, but it was
                    mainly what I sought out myself rather than something that anyone else
                    organized. I audited a course in political anthropology (I audited as many
                    things as I could) and the professor got off onto how few Foreign Service
                    Officers could speak Thai (his specialty was Thailand) . So although I was an
                    auditor, I couldn't resist putting up my hand and launching a counter-attack and
                    an explanation of what the Foreign Service was about. Nobody really made any
                    attempt to use me. They had Foreign Service Officers every year, it was a big
                    university. In fact, Marshall Brement was there the year I was, in Soviet
                    studies. So as far as the faculty was concerned we were not an exotic resource,
                    we were just another student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your attitude toward the academic world as far as
                        your later work was concerned? “It was interesting and I got what I wanted
                        out of it, but most of these guys really don't understand the situation and
                        they are up in the clouds.” Or else, yes there are things here that one
                        should do and to mine them for what you can. How did feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I came away feeling that the academic community certainly had things to
                    teach us, I didn't feel it was a wasted year at all. I think the work that
                    Johnson did and books like Charles Anderson's, and there were others, who had
                    very useful ways of conceptualizing what was going on. In the Foreign Service
                    you don't spend a lot of time thinking about long term trends, the rise of the
                    middle class, and that kind of thing. Because we're required to spend so much of
                    our time focusing on the day to day events, today's crisis, this happened to
                    day, it's got to be reported right away. We do big conceptual reports, a lot of
                    which are not very good because again, the writer's time frame is very short.
                    Somebody is in the country for two or three years and then they go on to
                    someplace else quite different. We acquire a lot of very specific knowledge very
                    quickly. During the time we're there I think there is nobody to beat us, I think
                    we have the best Foreign Service in the world, I don't think there is anybody
                    who can beat us as a source of specific information. If you want to know who the
                    key leaders are politically or economically at any given moment in country X,
                    there is no better source for that information than the U.S. Embassy. They can
                    tell you how they relate to one another and how they interplay and what the
                    probabilities are for their success over the next couple of years, and that kind
                    of thing. But a longer term analysis is not often done very well from the
                    field.</p>

                    Caracas I was told my year at Stanford might be canceled - an old Foreign
                    Service story - because I was needed on the desk. But they worked something out
                    and agreed to wait a year for me. So I took up the job in the summer of
                    1967.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the 1967 to 1969 period—this was basically the
                        Johnson time—what were your main duties and concerns during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I remember that I had barely arrived and one of the first things that hit
                    was the Caracas earthquake in which the Embassy came close to losing some lives.
                    We didn't lose any American lives, but we were told the entire political section
                    had been standing on the balcony of an apartment of one of the high-rise
                    buildings near the Embassy and the balcony damn near came off the building.
                    [laughter] They could have lost them all at once. Oil was always an issue in
                    dealing with Venezuela, there were always issues and problems related to the
                    treatment of American oil companies in Venezuela, and to the production of
                    Venezuelan oil and its export to the United States. There was a very intense
                    debate at that time about American dependence on foreign oil, whether it was too
                    much and therefore we were setting ourselves up to be pushed around by the
                    foreigners who controlled our oil supply - as of course happened a decade later,
                    but not by the Venezuelans. Or on the other had that we were producing too much
                    oil in the United States, and depleting our own supply of oil at a higher cost
                    to the U.S. consumer, and if we could get cheaper oil from overseas, why not? So
                    any discussion about a quota or a tariff on imports of oil was a big issue.
                    Venezuela was always trying to get itself accepted as the reliable supplier,
                    that if we had these concerns we might have them about places in the Middle
                    East, but we shouldn't have them about Venezuela which was right next door. They
                    didn't make that argument publicly, because it didn't play too well in
                    Venezuela, but they would make it privately in conversations with us.</p>
                <p>The guerrilla situation, the far left threat in Venezuela continued to be an
                    issue and I got to know the scholars of the guerrilla movements of the world,
                    people from Rand Corporation and so on, who would drop in every so often to get
                    updated on the insurgency in Venezuela. Which in fact was beginning to fade and
                    eventually disappeared altogether when the communists decided to run for
                    Congress. A couple of the leaders are sitting in the Venezuela Congress
                    today.</p>

                        Venezuelan oil, or something. Was this an issue at that time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I don't recall that Canada vs. Venezuela was a particular issue. It was
                    more the issue of whether there should be a limitation on foreign imports,
                    generally. And whether there was an exemption in there for Canada or not, I've
                    forgotten.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, we certainly did deal with the oil companies. But this was prior to
                    the nationalizations, so there were no huge issues between the companies and
                    Venezuela. Just a constant flow of minor things.</p>

                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The Venezuelan government at that point was still very high in our eyes,
                    and relations continued to be very good with Venezuela. At that point it had not
                    yet developed the series of major internal problems that it has today. It was
                    still a model of what we would now call a new or restored democracy. Democracy
                    had been restored in 1958. Leoni was elected in 1963 and then in 1968 Rafael
                    Caldera was elected for the first time, so you had the turnover, the final test
                    of democracy, when the government party turns power over to the opposition
                    party. In 1968, the Christian Democrats came into power in Venezuela and the
                    Christian Democrats were also in power in Chile and so that was the peak of what
                    looked like a new wave of Christian Democratic parties coming into power in
                    Latin America, as they had for years in Europe. It didn't turn out that way,
                    because politics in Latin America —surprise, surprise — didn't work the way it
                    did in Europe. We had a lot of work on the desk that related to establishing
                    relations with the new government, the Venezuelan Ambassador, the new officials
                    of the government. Some people that I had known when I was in Venezuela came to
                    Washington. That was a very interesting thing to observe.</p>

                        Venezuelan foreign service? The Ambassador and the Embassy as far as when
                        issues came up, did they know how to work Congress and the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>JONES: I think they were learning to in that period. The Venezuelans had,
                    comparatively speaking, in the Latin American context, lots of money and so they
                    could entertain. The Venezuelan Ambassador entertained frequently and lavishly
                    and had all kinds of well-known people to his house. I think they did a
                    reasonably good job. I think it is really much easier for us to go into a Latin
                    country and find out what's going on and acquire a base of knowledge and make
                    friends and so on. If the countries are smaller the United States carries
                    immense prestige. A foreign country coming here is faced with this huge country,
                    much, much bigger than the one they represent. The size of the bureaucracy alone
                    is daunting. Ma foreign diplomats come with the mind set that their relations
                    are with the State Department and the White House and it takes them a little
                    while to find out that 1) they never see the inside of the White House after
                    presenting their credentials (the very lucky ones once a year might get to see
                    the National Security Advisor), and 2) they find out that on many issues the
                    State Department is irrelevant. The real decisions that affect them are being
                    made by Interior, or Commerce, or Agriculture, or somewhere else. They have to
                    learn about those completely separate bureaucracies. It is much more difficult
                    for the foreign diplomat. I think the Venezuelans did reasonably well at it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: I got involved a lot in that later. That was a major part of my job at a
                    later stage. Venezuela and Colombia were both democracies and they were both
                    viewed as very friendly countries, good allies of the United States. There were
                    no problems on the Hill or anywhere else about giving them military assistance,
                    or making sales to them. There was a problem later on with regards to the
                    Venezuelans' desire to acquire the very latest fighter aircraft, but I was
                    dealing with that after I left the desk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: It didn't affect my work day, it didn't affect the relations with
                    Venezuela. Yes, of course we were seeking Venezuelan support (everybody's
                    support) for our position in Vietnam, but it didn't affect relations with
                    Venezuela at all. We certainly got into it after the work day. This was the
                    period when the Open Forum first got started.</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes, in the State Department. The protests about our intervention in
                    Vietnam were just getting started in the Foreign Service. When the Open Forum
                    first got started, Bill Luers, among others, suggested we have a subsidiary or
                    affiliate in each bureau. So I tried to get an open forum started in the Latin
                    American Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what an open forum was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The idea originally was that it would be a forum for discussion of foreign
                    policy issues, if necessary on a classified basis. In addition to bringing in
                    speakers and panel discussions, it started publishing a magazine that was at
                    least in part classified, to allow discussion of foreign policy issues within
                    house, in an informal way, without access to it by the press and outsiders. It
                    was a reaction to the pressures that were inside, that people wanted to express
                    their feelings about Vietnam and other issues, but they didn't want to break
                    with the Department. After the Cambodia bombing a petition to the Secretary was
                    circulated, supposedly as a purely internal thing, but it was clear to me that
                    it was going to become public and I and a lot of other people had to decide if
                    we were going to associate ourselves with it. I did not sign it because I
                    thought that it was wrong to criticize U.S. policy in a way that was sure to
                    become public. If you felt that way about it then you ought to resign, and then
                    criticize all you want on the outside. But there was a group of us who sent
                    forward a very critical memo, I think it was in the Open Forum context, a
                    classified channel, which we did not publicize and which did not leak. That got
                    us a meeting with Secretary Rogers. A group of eight or ten of us were selected
                    by some means from among the signers to attend this meeting—it was the first
                    time that I had met with any Secretary of State, in any capacity other than as a
                    note taker when he met with some visiting dignitary. It was certainly an
                    interesting experience. There was nothing that you could fault about his
                    reception of us, he was gracious and it was a gracious thing for him to meet
                    with us. There was a sense that the Department had to do something to respond to
                    this internal criticism or they were going to have a serious morale problem.</p>

                    wrenching political turnovers are a disastrous, appalling, aspect of American
                    government, but they began with the Carter administration, not earlier.</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes. The transition from Johnson to Nixon I recall as being very smooth.
                    There were senior Foreign Service Officers who were involved in the policymaking
                    of the new administration. Some of us mid-level officers had been talking in the
                    Open Forum about the failure of the Alliance for Progress, in terms of its
                    announced goals—I mean if you wanted to look at it purely as a vehicle for
                    transmitting assistance to Latin America, it had succeeded in that, it had
                    accomplished its goal. Not as much as had been originally trumpeted, but
                    substantial amounts. That's nothing to sneer at, there is certainly important
                    infrastructure in Latin America today that dates back to the Alliance for
                    Progress period. But in terms of its loftier goals of stabilizing democracy and
                    bringing about real economic reform, it clearly had been a dismal failure.
                    Unsurprisingly this was seen clearly at senior levels as well as at the
                    mid-level. The senior levels of the Department were involved in the formulation
                    of the Nixon Latin American policy which came to be called benign neglect, that
                    instead of the very activist Kennedy/Johnson posture of trying to make over
                    these countries in our image, we were now going to step back and let them run
                    their own affairs. Let them decide how they wanted to develop. We would be
                    friendly, we'd be benign, but we were going to defend our own interests. We were
                    not going to be activists pushing an agenda as it was perceived we had been in
                    the previous administrations. Although I had not voted for Nixon and I'm not a
                    Republican, I thought that was the right kind of policy to pursue. I had already
                    come to the conclusion, and certainly nothing has happened in the 30 years since
                    to change my mind, that the United States does not know a lot about how to run
                    other countries' affairs. And that every time we have tried to do it, the road
                    has been littered with failures. Things turned out completely the opposite of
                    the way we intended them to go, like trying to encourage the overthrow of
                    Allende in Chile, or blocking the election of Cheddi Jagan in Guyana, to name
                    only two of the many, many, examples. We didn't know enough about the dynamics
                    of other societies to be able to push in the right direction. I do think you
                    needed some corollaries to benign neglect, which subsequent administrations
                    added. But I think the fundamental concept that other countries are responsible
                    for their own development is sound. Development cannot be created externally,
                    you can't say “I'm going to give you one billion dollars and you are going to
                    develop.” It won't work unless the country itself is ready to develop, wants to
                    develop, and wants to make the effort.</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>JONES: One of the aspects of this period that is important, is that this was the
                    period of the experiment in integrating State and AID. It started at some point
                    while I was on the Venezuelan desk, I think after I had been there about a year.
                    It was announced that the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
                    Affairs would also be the Coordinator of the Alliance for Progress and the
                    Assistant Administrator of AID for Latin America, combining three jobs in one,
                    and that the bureaus and desks in AID dealing with Latin America would combine
                    both physically and organizationally with the State desks. So the AID desk
                    officer was now going to report to me. That was an interesting experience. It
                    was broken up after I left, I guess sometime in the late 1970's they separated
                    at the office levels and then they finally separated at the Assistant Secretary
                    level as well. The offices remained nearby, which was a great convenience at the
                    very least to have the physical proximity. That is now going to end because AID
                    is moving out of the State Department building.</p>
                <p>In Colombia, AID was a major player, they had a very large AID program at that
                    time. Marvin Weissman, who was subsequently the Ambassador to Costa Rica, was
                    the AID Mission Director for Colombia—administering hundreds of millions of
                    dollars. Of course the problem as with so many things done in the U.S.
                    government is that somebody at the top who wants to get something done and wants
                    to get it done right away, sends down an order that such-and-such will be done.
                    So it is done, with no preparation, no training, no planning, none of the
                    ingredients necessary to actually make it work. It really would have made more
                    sense to have had me reporting to the AID desk officer, who was older and who
                    had been in the job for years, than it was to do it the other way around. If we
                    were going to actually be running the AID operation, we needed more economic
                    training than most desk officers had, and more management training, but none of
                    that happened. We did the best we could, but I think in fact, the two
                    organizations continued to function much as they had before, with the added
                    burden of trying to adjust to each other's presence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Colombia during this time, from
                        your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>JONES: The great issue in Colombia at that time was how you could assure the
                    continuance of political tranquility. Colombia had the bloodiest civil war of
                    anyplace in Latin America. It was surpassed only by ours. It was fighting
                    between the liberal and conservative parties and their supporters. It had
                    finally been ended with an agreement that the parties would alternate in power
                    for, I believe, 20 years. At the time that I was on the desk it was still
                    working, working well, the country was stable and peaceful. There was every
                    reason to be hopeful for the future of Colombia. The question was, what would
                    happen when the truce came to an end and open political competition started
                    again. The conventional wisdom was that the liberals in fact were the dominant
                    party and that once you returned to political competition the liberals would win
                    most elections. That has in fact seemed to be the case. I guess it is quite
                    often the case that the things you worry about turn out not to be the real
                    issues. Nobody at that point was worried about drugs. Nobody saw that 20 years
                    down the line, Colombia would be controlled by drug barons and would be the
                    primary source of drug trafficking to the United States. On the economic side,
                    as I said, the AID program and of course coffee, we worked on a lot of issues
                    related to coffee. Much like oil with Venezuela. It wasn't the question of
                    domestic production, but the issues of price and the U.S. attitude toward, or
                    participation in the international coffee agreement, whether it was possible to
                    stabilize the price of coffee on the world market, whether the United States

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a desk officer, what would a normal day be? What type
                        of work would you be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I always thought and still think the desk jobs are the best jobs in the
                    Department. I enjoyed tremendously my four years as a desk officer. The State
                    Department has come a long way in terms of training. It does do a lot more
                    training than it used to. But its preferred modus operandi is still to dump
                    somebody into a job who has never done anything like that before, with no
                    training and preparation —they are given no instructions on how to do it, or
                    even what they're supposed to do. You are told to figure it out and do what seem
                    sensible and full speed ahead. That certainly was my experience during my entire
                    career.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I'm concerned that the quality of desk officers today has been affected by the
                    entirely laudable desire to establish equity among all members of the Service.
                    We have guilt feelings as American democrats over the fact that political and
                    economic officers are much more likely to become Ambassadors and Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries, and therefore, horror of horrors, might be viewed as some
                    kind of elite group. Administrative and consular so, the argument runs, officers
                    might be viewed as second class citizens and we've got to do something to
                    prevent that. One of the things that we've done about it is to fill the desks
                    with Admin and Consular officers, who do the best they can. But I don't
                    think—especially given the lack of any kind of training in what a desk officer
                    is supposed to do—the problem is that the Department itself doesn't have any
                    concept of what they are supposed to do. There is no ideology, there is no
                    viewpoint in the Department. You can't find anywhere a manual that says what the
                    responsibilities and obligations of a desk officer are. The reason that you
                    can't is probably because you couldn't get agreement on them. There is no
                    received wisdom with regard to the duties of any position. There is a little
                    more attention to the position of Ambassador, but not a hell of a lot more. So
                    you're thrown into the job, but if the desk is going to be properly run the
                    officer has to establish very clearly and keep hitting people over the head with
                    it, that everything that goes to the post, has to go through the desk. And it
                    has to have the desk officer's clearance. That can be done, it takes a lot of
                    work, it takes a lot of bureaucratic infighting. That's the way the system is
                    supposed to work and the system will work, if the desk officer is vigorous and
                    aggressive in establishing his or her role. It won't work if the desk officer
                    sits back and doesn't raise a fuss when somebody sends something out without
                    clearance. The philosophy is that nobody will defend you if you won't defend
                    yourself. You can establish your position as the central clearing house. It
                    doesn't mean that you can refuse clearance on 99% of the things that come across
                    your desk. Most of it, you have to automatically give your clearance, but the
                    point is that you know what's going on. You know what's going down to the post,
                    you can relate one thing to another because you're aware of things. You can keep
                    the post informed.</p>
                <p>The other big part of the job is that you are the post's main contact with the
                    Department. Desk officers work very closely with Ambassadors and DCM's. In most
                    countries they are the closest contact that the Ambassador and the DCM has in
                    Washington. Most Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Assistant Secretaries just
                    don't have the time to be in daily contact with anybody but their most important
                    Ambassadors, the ones who are in the midst of the most urgent crises. They
                    expect the desk officer to be the hand holder and to provide any service to the
                    Ambassador that is necessary. That's a very useful experience for a mid-level
                    officer, to have that kind of frequent, daily, contact with an Ambassador.</p>

                <p>JONES: I tend to remember the odd things, the funny things. A lot of time was
                    spent on an issue of no importance whatsoever. There were three tiny little
                    islands in the Caribbean Sea, and they were claimed by both Colombia and the
                    United States. They had the oddest names: one of them was called “Roncador,”
                    which means “The Snorer,” and another was “Quita Sue�o,” that which keeps you
                    awake. Colombia was anxious to establish its sovereignty and the question of
                    “Why not?” began to be asked in the Department. We had good relations with
                    Colombia, and do these islands have any importance to us, is there any good
                    reason why we should maintain our claim? Our claim was based on a law called the
                    Guano Act back in the 19th century, which said that the people who were making a
                    business out of collecting the droppings of birds and bats—guano—could lay claim
                    to any island on which they found guano.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the “Bird Shit” rule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Exactly. [laughter] I was trying to keep this interview clean. [laughter]
                    So it was entirely on the basis of the fact that once a long time ago, these
                    islands had been rich in guano, that we had laid claim to them. We did finally
                    accomplish a formal renunciation of U.S. sovereignty over these little islands
                    and I had a great feeling of accomplishment. I think at high tide there was
                    almost no island there, that's how tiny they were. They weren't entirely under
                    water, but close to it. I dealt a lot with Occidental Petroleum, oddly, on the
                    Colombian desk more than I had on the Venezuelan desk because they weren't in
                    Venezuela. They were interested in that general area of the Caribbean and they
                    were interested in know what a renunciation of U.S. sovereignty might mean to
                    their potential for prospecting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem while you were working on this with
                        Congress, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Fortunately no. Nobody ever got excited about these three little
                    bat-dropping islands. We also spent some time on the Pan American Highway issue,
                    during the Nixon administration. Nixon for some reason (or people working for
                    Nixon) got interested in the idea of completing the Pan American Highway. The
                    highway, which was built two-thirds with U.S. money, is complete except for one
                    stretch from the Panama Canal to the Colombian border where there are no roads
                    at all. It looked for a while as if the United States might actually finance the
                    construction of that last stretch of the highway. Then it would have been
                    possible to drive all the way from Alaska to Buenos Aires, a long exhausting
                    journey over some very bad roads, but nevertheless, it would be possible. But it
                    didn't happen. Apparently it was a tremendous engineering job to build a highway
                    through jungle and swamp, and there was concern that you would be removing a
                    natural barrier to hoof-and-mouth disease, that cattle would wander north from
                    Colombia and the disease spread to the United States. And environmental
                    concerns—although those were not quite as strong back then as they are now, but
                    there were concerns about that too.</p>

                <p>JONES: Elected. Elected under this political pact, under which anybody could run,
                    but since there was a candidate who had the backing of the liberal and
                    conservative parties he was a foregone conclusion to win. There was free

                    resolution that related to Cuba and you had to go about getting support for the

                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, because there was no significant communist threat in Colombia. You had
                    the guerrilla movement in Venezuela, but it wasn't posing a threat, it was under
                    control. If you had guerrillas in Colombia at that time, they were very small. I
                    can't remember there being a concern at all. It's amazing how the situation in
                    countries can completely change. I went down as desk officer to visit Medellin
                    and Cali, we had consulates in both cities, no threat at all, at that time, from
                    terrorists or drug traffickers.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes, and not concerned or aware of enough the big issues that he was
                    dealing with. I came to essentially the same conclusion, a little earlier—I was
                    too much of a Latin American specialist and I did not have enough experience in
                    other areas. I wanted to get into Europe. So I looked at what was available
                    (this was still in the period where if I had been overseas it would have been
                    hard to find out what was available, but since I was in the Department it was
                    easier) and I looked at several jobs that were possibilities, Milan, Frankfurt,
                    and then someone suggested that I talk to IO and look at IO jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IO being the International Organizations Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. There was a job in the U.S. Mission to the International
                    Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the post was Vienna. It was a political advisor
                    job. That immediately piqued my interest. It was a very unusual situation, in
                    that we had a resident minister full time in Vienna, he was in fact a man of
                    ambassadorial rank, Dwight Porter, for the whole period I was there. Then above
                    him was the Ambassador to the IAEA, who was based in Washington, with an office
                    in the State Department. He went out to Vienna four or five times a year for the
                    major conferences. The Ambassador was Keith Glennan, a former member of the U.S.
                    Atomic Energy Commission. He interviewed me and offered me the job. As it turned
                    out I had a difficult decision to make, the Ambassador from Colombia offered me
                    the job of political counselor in Bogota, which was a jump up and very
                    attractive. It was very hard to make up my mind. But I decided to stick with my
                    original plan—because people had told me that the problem with moving into
                    another bureau is that what will be offered to you by the bureau that knows you
                    and where you have established your credentials is going to be better than what
                    is likely to be offered to you by the bureau that doesn't know you. So I was
                    somewhat psychologically prepared for the fact that I was going to have to give
                    up something good in Latin America in order to move into Europe.</p>
                <p>So I went through twelve weeks of German at FSI. IO would not let me take any
                    more than that because they were jumping up and down to get me out to Vienna,
                    the Political Advisor was leaving and they wanted me to have two days overlap
                    with him before he left. Also because, as they told me and it turned out to be
                    true, German was not used at all in the job, English was the language spoken in
                    the Atomic Energy Agency. You needed German only for shopping and restaurants.
                    Nevertheless, I regret that I wasn't able to finish the full course.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Vienna?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>JONES: From 1971 to 1974, three years. It was a very good job. It certainly was
                    one of the highlights of my Foreign Service experience. I really enjoyed those
                    three years in Vienna. I enjoyed working in the international environment. The
                    larger countries had resident missions there, but at the time of the big
                    conferences you had well over one hundred countries sending delegates to the
                    General Conference of the IAEA. Working with that variety of different countries
                    and doing the kind of lobbying and corridor politicking that goes on in
                    international organizations was very new and very interesting to me.</p>
                <p>Nonproliferation was also a field that was both new and very interesting. I tried
                    very hard after leaving Vienna to get another job in the nonproliferation field.
                    It's odd because I could have gotten another IO job quite easily, but there
                    simply weren't that many jobs working on nonproliferation issues - despite its
                    critical importance to our national security - and there were none that were
                    available right then. I was never able again to make the right timing to get
                    into a good job in that field, so I never came back to it after Vienna. Other
                    than to write my paper on it at the National War College. I always regretted
                    that because I thought it was something that was really important and that was
                    really worthwhile to work on. So it was a complete change from Latin America, of
                    course there were a few, just a handful, of Latin American embassies in Vienna
                    and their primary mission was to the Austrian government. They spent only a
                    fraction of their time on atomic energy matters. The people who did have full
                    time specialists there were the major European countries and ourselves.</p>
                <p>It was also my first contact with the Russians, I had never been a country where
                    there was a Russian Embassy before and here they were a major player. Although
                    we treated them with some caution, it was still the cold war after all, and we
                    did a lot of speculating about who among the people we were dealing with was KGB
                    and who wasn't. I think they were more unreservedly friendly toward us than we
                    were toward them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I think some of our reserve in dealing with them stemmed from our
                    doubts as to whether they could ever really be on the same side. But I think
                    that very clearly they were. They shared our view that proliferation of nuclear
                    weapons did not serve the state interests of the atomic powers. On
                    nonproliferation issues they were our most solid collaborator. The people that
                    we had the biggest arguments with, ironically, were the Western Europeans whose
                    commercial firms were determined to sell nuclear equipment and materials. The
                    same thing was true in the conventional arms field, that the American companies
                    were more used to and more accepting of government regulation, than European
                    companies were. The European governments had great difficulty enacting
                    legislation that would restrict the export of nuclear supplies or arms.</p>

                        weapons out of other areas. I would have thought that, particularly in that
                        time, in 1971 - 1974, that South Africa, Israel, India/Pakistan, and Brazil
                        were the major players. Was that the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Certainly we were concerned about Argentina and Brazil and I'm not sure we
                    had all of the evidence at that time, but we suspected and certainly later
                    confirmed that both countries had nuclear weapons programs. India, South Africa,
                    and Israel did too, and there was concern that new sales would add other people
                    to the club. Sales to Argentina and Brazil would enable them to complete their
                    programs, same thing with Pakistan and South Africa. So all of those were
                    concerns. The day-to-day nuts and bolts work was completing the net of
                    acceptance of the Nonproliferation Treaty, the NPT. Getting as many countries as
                    possible, getting all of the hold out countries into one form or another of
                    acceptance of the treaty. One of our accomplishments in the Mission, not really
                    mine, but of other people in the Mission was getting—the Latins had created
                    their own treaty, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, to ban nuclear weapons. During the
                    period that I was there, the first Tlatelolco country came to the IAEA to
                    negotiate an agreement for inspections under the treaty, the country was Panama,
                    and the Mission was successful in getting an agreement between the Agency and
                    Panama which was essentially identical to the agreement that Panama would have
                    entered into had it been a party to the NPT. So we avoided the specter of having
                    two totally different regimes, and levels of inspection, and it became
                    irrelevant whether a country was under Tlatelolco, or under the NPT. As a
                    consequence, now most of them are under both.</p>
                <p>Of course the developing countries were interested in technical assistance from
                    the agency. Technical assistance in beneficial uses of atomic energy, and at
                    that time the belief was much more widespread that there lots of beneficial
                    uses, than it is today—including some very wild ideas about how atomic energy
                    might benefit them. The developing countries wanted to make sure that they got
                    in on the act and they thought of it in terms of, all right, we will accept
                    these nonproliferation rules, but in return for that we want an ironclad
                    commitment that we are going to get substantial technical assistance out of the
                    agency. Their feeling was always that not enough funding was being provided for
                    technical assistance and that the West wasn't living up to its commitment. So
                    you had that argument going on endlessly and coming up at every major
                    conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the international organizations—one of the problems
                        that we often have is with France. Was France a problem in this case?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>JONES: I think France and Germany were equally difficult. The British were fully
                    on our side, but this was the early period of their membership in the European
                    Union and the British representative, Freddy Jackson, got very upset with me one
                    day because during an IAEA meeting I leaned over to consult with him (as we did
                    constantly) and he felt that would be perceived by his European colleagues, as
                    the U.S. and the U.K. once again going behind their back to consult on something
                    and he felt that I had compromised him, simply by approaching him. [laughter] So
                    the British were having to walk a tight rope between the policies that they had
                    always pursued jointly with the U.S. and what the European Union, very much
                    driven by their commercial considerations, would permit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about India? From my understanding India has always
                        maintained the idea that they were not going to join the NPT unless we
                        eliminated all nuclear weapons. Was that their stand at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, India and Mexico and any number of others felt that the West was not
                    doing nearly enough toward disarmament. The main argument used against joining
                    the NPT was that it was a grossly discriminatory document, that it gave absolute
                    free reign to explode, test, use, nuclear weapons to the five publicly
                    acknowledged nuclear weapons states but prohibited it for everyone else. You
                    were in effect being asked to sign a document saying that you cannot do this,
                    but it's perfectly okay if I do it. In the case of India, one could question the
                    ultimate sincerity of this argument since they clearly had nuclear weapons. But
                    there were others who used it with more sincerity, and others who—leaving aside
                    the strictly nuclear issue, leaving aside any question of equality of
                    treatment—who felt that the NPT did contain explicit pledges by the big powers
                    to work toward disarmament. The argument was made that the West had not done
                    nearly enough to fulfill those pledges. The NPT has a provision that every five
                    years there will be an international conference to review progress under the
                    treaty. At every review conference that argument was fought out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, how did you view and how did we act
                        towards Israel? We've always had this dual policy towards Israel on nuclear
                        things, at least it seems to me that we know bloody well that they have
                        developed the bomb and they have it but at the same time, we have to treat
                        them with extra care. Was there a problem there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes, it was something we were all conscious of. As you said, everyone knew
                    that the Israelis had a or several nuclear weapons. But it wasn't something that
                    you could prove and there were political reasons for not saying anything
                    publicly even if you could prove it. It was not a major issue in IAEA
                    conferences, it was not one of the boiling hot issues. One of the most difficult
                    diplomatic issues that we had during that period was the Chinese seat. This was
                    the period when Kissinger went to China and we suddenly shifted our whole
                    Chinese policy. Part of the problem was that the White House did not send
                    (perhaps for domestic political reasons) clear instructions down through the
                    bureaucracy. So you had a new relationship being created with China but IO was
                    still operating under the standing instructions that we were to oppose China's
                    taking over the Taiwanese seat in all U.N. agencies. We had extended and
                    acrimonious negotiations with the Romanians who were acting on behalf of the
                    Chinese, in which the Romanians were very puzzled. They came into the
                    negotiations all smiles and went out of them with very puzzled frowns because we
                    were not caving in as they had expected. We were still following instructions to
                    try to preserve the Taiwanese seat if we possibly could, working very closely
                    with the Taiwanese Ambassador in Vienna. Ultimately of course, the Chinese came
                    into the IAEA and all of the other U.N. agencies. Then we had a very complicated
                    budgetary problem about what their assessment was going to be and how to
                    construct the IAEA budget to end Taiwanese contributions and pick up the
                    Chinese.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How sincere did you feel the support was that you were
                        getting from the Nixon/Kissinger administration towards this? Because
                        Kissinger and Nixon were often playing almost a double game, they had other
                        things going on, so they would make noises about one thing, but if they
                        weren't focused on that then you really didn't get the support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Kissinger playing a double game, I'm shocked. [laughter] On the nuclear
                    proliferation issues, one of the things that made the work enjoyable was that
                    there was a real community of people who believed in these issues. People at the
                    Atomic Energy Commission, people in the State Department, people there in the
                    Mission, most of them had been life-long specialists in this field; Ambassador
                    Porter and I were among the rare drop-in's. We all believed in what we were
                    doing and adopted very much of a common front against the pesky Europeans. There
                    was very little dissent, very little problem in getting what we wanted out of
                    Washington in the way of support. To the extent that there was a problem, the
                    problem was the lack of progress on disarmament issues. Which were going on, to
                    the extent that they were going on at all, in the Committee on Disarmament in
                    Geneva, and that was a totally different set of people, the people who worked on
                    disarmament. I think the calculations of Kissinger and the White House were
                    related to those issues, so the progress there or the lack of progress affected
                    the work that we were doing in Vienna.</p>

                    now ready to come back into it. So I looked around for a job in Latin America
                    and there were several things under discussion and I remember it was three weeks
                    before we were due to leave Vienna, my successor was arriving, and I still
                    didn't have an assignment. I called up the guy in personnel who was handling my
                    transfer and he said, “Haven't those orders been issued? You're going to
                    Guatemala, everybody here knows that, didn't anybody tell you?” [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: I was head of the political section. There were two other officers in the
                    section, Donald Johnson and Raymond Burghardt. I had dinner with Don two nights
                    ago, he has just completed a tour as Ambassador to Mongolia, and the State
                    Department's candidate to succeed him there is Ray Burghardt. [laughter]</p>

                <p>JONES: Politically that particular period was something of a lull between storms.
                    The President was Kjell Laugerud. A general with a Norwegian name, who was
                    probably the best of the military presidents that Guatemala had in the post
                    World War II era. He was not a saint, by any means, but he was by temperament
                    more of a conciliator and less of a tyrant than most of his colleagues who made
                    it to the presidency. So it was a military dictatorship, on paper it was
                    elected, but the elections had been repeatedly stolen over the years. We were
                    able to have reasonably good relations with his government, he certainly sought
                    good relations with the United States. Because the level of human rights abuses
                    was relatively low at that point, we were not under such tremendous pressure as
                    we were both earlier and later, to really turn the screws on the Guatemalan
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests there at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The issue that took up the largest single chunk of my time was the
                    Guatemala/Belize dispute. Guatemala claimed Belize was a part of its territory.
                    There was considerable concern that with a military government in power, the
                    Guatemalan army might simply take it into its head at some point to invade the
                    territory and seize it. Belize at that time was still a British colony, and
                    because of the dispute there were no diplomatic relations between Guatemala and
                    Britain, but there were consular relations. One of the nice aspects of Latin
                    America is that, I think uniquely in the world, they long ago invented this
                    doctrine that political relations and consular relations are separate, and if
                    you break relations with a country you don't withdraw your consul—it's very
                    pragmatic, you've got to figure that your citizens have got to travel to the
                    other country anyway, and so you need somebody there to issue the visas. So
                    Guatemala never closed down its consulate in Britain, and they allowed the
                    British to have a consul there. Of course the British named someone who was
                    senior enough to be an Ambassador and functioned as an Ambassador. We worked
                    very closely with him in exchanging information and looking for ways to resolve
                    the dispute—the British of course were interested in getting it off of their
                    back. They had to station troops in Belize which they would much rather not have
                    there, they would like to be able to pull them out and get disengaged and
                    disinvolved from this remote corner of the world. Our interests largely
                    coincided with theirs because we were very interested in not having a war in the
                    Americas, not having a military action between any two countries, including
                    Guatemala and Belize, with all of the consequences that we saw later in the
                    Falklands. So I spent a large part of my time—you would get pieces of
                    information that the dispute had heated up, or it had cooled down, and you were
                    always involved in trying to assess just how likely it was that the Guatemalans
                    would take some hot-headed action. And also analyzing various proposals and
                    ideas for resolving the dispute.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>One of the real problems the Guatemalans had was in terms of the maritime
                    boundary; if you drew the boundaries by conventional rules, they would have a
                    very narrow corridor out into the Caribbean. So one of the solutions to the
                    dispute was to try to encourage both sides to agree on modified maritime
                    limits—there was no disposition on the part of Belize or of the British to cede
                    any of the land territory, but there were indications that they were willing to
                    compromise on the issue of the maritime boundary. That would solve one of the
                    Guatemalans' problems and might help push the overall dispute along to
                    resolution. During my three years, we didn't get anywhere. These territorial
                    disputes move extremely slowly if they move at all. I think we were essentially
                    pretty much where we were when I left as when I arrived. I did feel that the
                    U.S. influence, exercised primarily through the embassy, had helped restrain the
                    hot-heads in Guatemala—had helped convince them that if they did invade Belize
                    they would have not only the British but also the Americans very much against
                    them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, mainly in private. We tried to avoid embarrassing them by rubbing it
                    in more than we had to publicly. It was our assessment, which we had to make
                    over and over again in reporting to the Department, that the Guatemalans were
                    unlikely to attack. The British were always more nervous than we were
                    (understandably given their situation). The British were always alarmed by some
                    new piece of intelligence or other information that they interpreted as meaning
                    the Guatemalans were getting ready to move. It was the embassy's judgment that
                    it was very unlikely that the Guatemalans would in fact do this, that whatever
                    else you thought of the Guatemalans, their leadership was not stupid and it was
                    not going to plunge into this, given the obvious consequences. For whatever
                    reasons that was the right analysis since no Guatemalan action ever took place
                    then or later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about American commercial interests in
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>JONES: They were not great, there wasn't a huge amount of American commercial
                    interest. The other major issue that consumed our time (at least in the
                    political section) was in the broadest sense, the issue of human rights. From
                    the perspective of U.S. human rights organizations there was only one aspect to
                    Guatemala, which was the aspect of government security forces killing innocent
                    people, which certainly occurred in Guatemala, before, during and after my time
                    there. But from the U.S. Government's perspective, the situation had other
                    aspects as well. One of them was the fact that Guatemala had and has the oldest
                    guerrilla movement in the Americas, it has had a continuous guerrilla movement
                    going on since 1960. There was no indication that it was anywhere close to
                    coming to power, but its activities were a concern to us. Then, and perhaps the
                    greatest concern of all at that time, there was simply the Guatemalan propensity
                    for killing each other for political reasons. Guatemalans are wonderful people
                    and I enjoyed tremendously knowing them, but I never served among a people who
                    would so casually eliminate each other as they would in Guatemala. Most
                    politicians carried weapons all of the time. A significant number of my closest
                    contacts were killed either during the time I was there or after I left. Meme
                    Colon, the former mayor of Guatemala City, Danilo Barillas and a host of others.
                    Trying to report on and analyze this self- destructiveness in which the
                    Guatemalans were engaged, was a major preoccupation. The specifically human
                    rights side of it was a growing concern because of growing interest in the
                    United States. First of all we had the amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act
                    in the Ford administration and I remember standing in the embassy in Guatemala
                    and listening to Jimmy Carter's inaugural address on the radio, in which he used
                    the term human rights over and over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was January 20, 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Right. So there was a trend in the United States and also there was a
                    trend in Guatemala, particularly after things grew worse and worse. As near as
                    we could tell (there was a lot of debate about it) Laugerud had control over who
                    would succeed him and he picked (I won't say the worst General, because there
                    were certainly a lot of competitors for the worst possible General he could have
                    picked) one of the worst people in the senior levels of the Guatemalan army,
                    Romeo Lucas, that he could have possibly picked to succeed him. Something we
                    didn't understand then and I don't think we ever understood was if he felt
                    compelled, if he felt he didn't have any choice, or if there was some mysterious
                    tie to this guy that we didn't know about. We thought Laugerud had done a
                    reasonably good job, given the fact that he was a military dictator, in
                    restraining the violent forces that were involved in Guatemala. And to sort of
                    throw it all away by turning the government over to a troglodyte, a Neanderthal,
                    was incredible. And things didn't get any better for years after that.</p>

                <p>JONES: Honestly I can't remember if United Fruit was still active in Guatemala at

                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think a lot of things had happened, the nature of the banana business
                    had changed, it became less profitable, so that U.S. companies were not as
                    dominant in it as they had been previously, and no one company had the dominance
                    that United Fruit had once had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cuba factor at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Not in a striking way, the way it had been in Venezuela with the landing
                    of a boat on the seacoast, or that it was in a number of other places. It was
                    clear the Cubans were giving assistance to the guerrillas, they were giving
                    military training to the guerrillas who went off to Cuba. There probably was
                    financial and military equipment support as well. Although, I think the
                    guerrillas did pretty well financing themselves and arming themselves, by
                    domestic actions, banks were always getting robbed, and it was always a nice
                    question as to whether a given incident had been carried out by criminals or if
                    they were guerrillas who were collecting money for the revolution. The line
                    between the criminals and guerrillas got a little fuzzy at times. They also
                    would stage a raid and capture some weapons. I don't think Cuba was critical to
                    the continuance of the guerrilla movement, it was doing all right on its own at
                    a relatively low level.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were its relations with its neighbor to the north,
                        Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: They were okay. The Guatemalans worried about and were a little suspicious
                    of the Mexicans as any of the Latin American countries are of a larger neighbor.
                    But they were not tense, I remember the president of Mexico came to visit
                    Guatemala toward the end of my time. You had Guatemalans across the border and
                    in Mexico, but I think they were not the numbers of them that there were later,
                    and you did not yet have them organized into formal camps as they later became.
                    So that wasn't as much of an irritant to relations with Mexico as it
                    subsequently became. Irritants on both sides because the Mexicans didn't want to
                    have these people on their territory and yet the Guatemalans felt that the
                    Mexicans were allowing the guerrillas to use Mexican territory as a base, there
                    were people who were slipping out of the camps and moving back across the border
                    to cause trouble.</p>

                <p>JONES: They were good, there were no particular problems. There were also
                    military governments in both of those countries at this time, so they were birds
                    of a feather. There was no reason not to get along well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, that was a little later. It was in 1979 when Somoza was overthrown.
                    That had not become a Central American issue at that point.</p>

                <p>JONES: The Ambassador the first couple of years that I was there was Frank Meloy,
                    who went from Guatemala to Lebanon and was murdered in Lebanon almost
                    immediately after arriving. Most of us who had known him were still there in the
                    embassy and it was a great shock to the embassy staff when we heard the news. He
                    was succeeded by Davis Eugene Boster, but everybody called him Gene. I think he
                    was there a year, maybe less than a year before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective how did they find the country?
                        They've got a military dictatorship, our interests were not overly great,
                        and most of the time it sounds like we were nagging at them about human
                        rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's true. I'm tempted to say that was true of most of our embassies in
                    Latin America. That's changing and hopefully that will change entirely someday.
                    As countries become industrialized and full participants in the world economy,
                    then you have a mature dialogue, there are all kinds of common issues that you
                    can talk about. When the countries are not yet at that level then the
                    connection, the relationship, between the United States and the country, is much
                    less rich and varied. A lot of what you are dealing with them on is complaints,
                    you are nagging at them. Or they at you to a lesser degree, but still to some
                    degree. Because the thing that Washington wants you to do above everything else,
                    is to get them to stop causing trouble, whether over a border controversy, or
                    human rights, or a military coup, or their expropriation of an American company.
                    Those were the things which were the big issues during most of my time in Latin
                    America. Because their economy and their internal development hadn't reached the
                    level where those irritants simply wouldn't occur—there would be no question of
                    their invading a neighbor, there would be no question of their expropriating a
                    foreign company, they wouldn't be abusing human rights, there wouldn't be
                    military coups. Those things are all characteristics of less developed countries
                    and when you get beyond that stage, those are no longer issues. So the U.S.
                    Embassy is no longer nagging at you about them. [laughter]</p>

                        contacts you would make? Some of those countries obviously don't know
                        anything about that, but you have the ten families of any Central American
                        country—did you find that there were people you went to, other than the
                        Generals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was not an economic oligarchy in Guatemala as there—at that time—I'm
                    groping to say whether or not it's a factor of time or simply the difference
                    between one country and another. I think it's probably more a factor of time,
                    not only in Guatemala but in other countries as well. Back in the period when
                    coffee was overwhelmingly the export, the coffee plantation owners not only in
                    Guatemala but in other coffee exporting countries, they did constitute an
                    oligarchy. You had similar situations in other countries where you had one
                    dominant crop and its control was in the hands of a few families. Again, there
                    is a factor of development that occurs here. There are infinite stages of
                    development that you go through, not just a simple step of one day you are less
                    developed and the next day you are developed. They had moved beyond that stage,
                    the economy was more diversified. There were certainly businessmen who exercised
                    political influence, but they were by no means a secret group that was running
                    the country. The military ran Guatemala then and for a long time afterwards.
                    Although there were ways in which their interests were allied with those of the
                    powerful businessman and it was quite common for Colonels to—businessmen would
                    take a Colonel and make him a low interest loan or sell him a valuable piece of
                    property at a low price, or something like that in order to establish a
                    relationship with him that they could draw on in the future. Nevertheless, the
                    military really governed Guatemala in its own interest, in its own perception of
                    Guatemala's interest and it wasn't being manipulated by other groups.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>JONES: [laughter] I expect you know the answer I'm going to give to that
                    question, because I expect it's the answer you get from everybody. The military
                    attach�s were almost useless as sources of information, not only in Guatemala
                    but elsewhere as well. In the first place their function was to be an
                    intelligence officer but they were not professional intelligence officers, most
                    of them were serving a single tour of duty as an attach�. Very few attach�s went
                    on to become Generals. It was not regarded as a career- enhancing specialty in
                    the Army or in any of the services. So it did not attract the best people, they
                    were not professional intelligence officers, they were from another specialty
                    who were dragooned into a tour as an attach�. The Latin American military were
                    smart enough to know that what they did say to a U.S. military attach� was going
                    to be reported and rarely did they say anything that was of any significance or
                    that helped us out. The military attach�s used to send in a lot of newspaper
                    clippings to DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency. We used to joke that that was
                    their main function. In their defense, they had a very hard task, especially in
                    Guatemala, but generally in any of the military dictatorships that I was
                    familiar with. The task of finding out what the military thought and what they
                    were up to, was an extremely—they were a very hard target. They were not
                    talkative about the institution and discussing its intentions with foreigners
                    was, to put it mildly, not encouraged. In Chile it was very tightly controlled,
                    I've forgotten if we observed this in Guatemala, but I wouldn't be surprised. If
                    you were invited anywhere by a foreigner you had to report it to your superiors
                    and it had to be approved before you could go. If you invited a whole bunch of
                    military people, if they decided to go at all they would pick two or three who
                    would be their chosen representatives and everyone else would decline.

                    all, the CIA people were professional intelligence officers, they were making a
                    career out of it, almost all of them that I knew were very dedicated to their
                    career, very hard working, and they were good quality people. Their product, the
                    intelligence product was certainly useful. How useful it was varied from country
                    to country and time to time, and a lot of the agency product, too much of it,
                    covered the same areas that the embassy political officers were working on. This
                    was a constant source of irritation, and I don't think they told Washington that
                    much more about normal, overt politics that was of any tremendous interest. The
                    same point could be made about much of our reporting, was there really any need
                    for Washington to know who was in and who was out, and what the inner
                    machinations were of party X compared with party Y. There was an insatiable
                    demand for information from Washington which drove both the embassy and the CIA,
                    and yet one wonders what Washington ever did with the mountains of information
                    that it got. Other than to fill up the files and demonstrate how well informed
                    they were. I always thought that by far, we were the best informed government in
                    the world. We produced the best information of any foreign service in the world.
                    I had much more doubt about our knowing what to do with the information that we
                    got. [laughter] At times I think there was a lot of information for
                    information's sake, rather than relating it to things that we really needed to
                    know.</p>
                <p>But having said that, there was a part of CIA's reporting dealing with what the
                    communist party was thinking and again, varying from country to country and time
                    to time, but there were times and places where they had really good penetration
                    into the leadership of the extreme left and were able to give us some really
                    useful information about what the left were up to. They were not much more
                    successful that the military attach�s with the military target. Again, that was
                    just an extremely difficult target to penetrate. If you want to talk to a
                    political leader, even a far left political leader, it's relatively easy to get
                    to him and being a political animal he wants to talk, he likes to talk about
                    politics. It's very hard to get to a foreign military officer, he's on a
                    military base, he's constantly associating with his military colleagues, he's
                    cut off from the world. That's one of the major problems, why there has been so
                    much difficulty with Latin American military over the decades, because they are
                    so isolated. Much more than our military, they are so cut off from the rest of
                    the society and when you get to them, their whole training is to keep their
                    mouths shut and salute, it's not to sit down and spill their guts to a
                    foreigner. By and large the CIA's information on the military was very scarce
                    and we didn't get a lot out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Central America and up into Mexico, from the people I've
                        interviewed, it's always seemed to be a place where the American labor
                        movement or labor attach�s, spent a considerable amount of time working in
                        there, more than any other place. This seemed to be one of the main thrusts
                        of our policy over a fairly extended period of time. Was this true in
                        Guatemala when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>JONES: We did not have a full time labor attach�. One of the officers in my
                    Section spent part time on labor. Many aspects of Guatemalan society were sad,
                    it was sad that they kept killing each other, it was sad that the military had
                    seized power and had no inclination to give it up and let people choose their
                    own government, and the human rights violations were tragic. The story of the
                    labor movement is just another very sad chapter in Guatemalan history. The
                    efforts to try to build up the labor movement—I think the American Institute for
                    Free Labor Development, AIFLD (which is a branch of the AFL-CIO) did very useful
                    work in bringing labor leaders to the U.S. for training, running training
                    courses in Guatemala, and in many other countries, but it was a very uphill
                    battle. The business class had no interest in unions, no belief in unions, they
                    would lock them out and break the union at the first opportunity that they
                    possibly could. It was not a happy story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, and again this was 1974 - 1977, were
                        there any major events such as earthquakes, coups, state visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: [laughter] I'm glad you mentioned the word earthquake. We were almost
                    through with Guatemala without mentioning the most extraordinary event of my
                    time there. The February 1976 earthquake, which was a 7 on the Richter Scale.
                    Because it hit at 3:00 in the morning and the homes of the poor were normally
                    adobe with no reinforcement whatsoever, the loss of life was enormous. I think
                    there were about 30,000 people killed in the earthquake. It was one of the most
                    lethal earthquakes, I think it ranks up there among the top 20 in the history of
                    the world. Because everybody was home in bed and the roofs fell in on them and
                    killed thousands of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: At home in bed. We were very lucky because we had spent some time house
                    hunting and we had found a nice modern house and we said that we would take it,
                    and we signed a contract on it, but there was some refurbishing that needed to
                    be done. That was all agreed to with the landlord and then the day came when we
                    were to sign the lease and we were told that the landlord had decided to rent it
                    somebody else. So the house we wound up in was not nearly as attractive a house,
                    but it had been built by a former Minister of Public Works, as his own home, so
                    it was very well built. [laughter] The house had no damage from the quake, we
                    lost a number of personal possessions, glasses fell off of shelves, and vases
                    got broken. Days or weeks later when we drove by and the saw the house that we
                    had been intending to rent, part of the roof had fallen in and all sorts of
                    things had happened to it. We were very glad that we had not gotten it after
                    all. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the embassy do with this disaster? How did we
                        respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>JONES: There were a few people who actually slept through the earthquake,
                    amazingly. Those who didn't, I don't think anybody went back to bed, it was not
                    an experience to go back to sleep after. After we had reassured our family (we
                    had four children between the ages of 7 and 14) and surveyed the household, I
                    went in to the embassy. In the middle and upper class sections of Guatemala City
                    there wasn't a lot of visible damage. A few tiles off of roofs and so on, but
                    there wasn't the impression that a lot had happened. Actually, I was more
                    impressed once I got into the embassy because the books were off of shelves,
                    water coolers were overturned—there was more visible damage inside the embassy
                    than there was in my own house. We found out later that some of the copper
                    pipes, plumbing and so on had been broken and they had to be replaced. The DCM,
                    George Andrews, was already there and told me there was only one working
                    telephone in the embassy, the switchboard was out. The phone was down on one of
                    the lower floors, so he went to his office and told me to stay by the phone. The
                    first thing we did was to call the Operations Center and report what had
                    happened. Somehow the news organizations found out that was the one working
                    phone in the embassy (probably from the State Department because we had given
                    them the number when we had reported in) and so I found myself talking to CBS
                    and other media people calling to find out what was going on in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>Of course the embassy's long-term response took place over weeks and months
                    afterwards. Everything else in the embassy ceased, in terms of normal
                    activities. For the next several weeks I forgot about the Belize/Guatemala
                    controversy and human rights violations and worked full time on the
                    earthquake—all of the details of getting the assistance mobilized and the right
                    kind of assistance. We began a major relief effort, we got the military in
                    Panama to send in helicopters and field hospitals and tents and that kind of
                    thing. AID mobilized its resources and there was a lot of assistance given to
                    rebuilding people's homes. In fact, later on the Peace Corps was active in
                    trying to teach people how to build an adobe home but reinforce it so that the
                    roof would not fall in.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>One of the characteristics of well-publicized natural disasters is that everyone
                    in the world wants to be helpful and all kinds of assistance arrives that is not
                    useful. So we had to try to get people to concentrate on what the needs were—try
                    to get the Guatemalans to tell us what they really needed and then get that word
                    out to those who were trying help. It was an exciting time, because we felt that
                    we were really doing something worthwhile. A lot of overtime was put in. We got
                    an urgent request—I was called at home to say that a NIACT Immediate telegram
                    —NIACT for night action—had come in that required an immediate response
                    justifying the need for assistance—probably for Congressional testimony by
                    someone. I and an AID officer went in and we drafted a response at 3:00 in the
                    morning to this telegram. I made the decision not to wake the Ambassador or the
                    DCM; we had extensively discussed the arguments for relief aid in the preceding
                    days. The next morning Ambassador Meloy read it and said maybe he should ask us
                    to write all our telegrams at 3 a.m. That did not normally happen, very few
                    other times, if ever, did I send a telegram out at 3:00 in the morning in the
                    course of my career. We had the feeling of being part of a common effort,
                    embassy and AID were working together more closely than we normally did,
                    normally we were off each doing our own thing. Here we were working hand in
                    hand. It was very rewarding. There was something of a let down afterwards, I'm
                    told that the psychologists say that there is always a post-stress syndrome. You
                    are doing fine at the time of greatest stress, but when it's over your
                    psychological and physical adrenalin disappears and you're back to normal and
                    you no longer have all of the excitement and the special things to do and you go
                    through a period of depression. We got through all of that and eventually got
                    back to normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By any chance, were people talking about the horrible
                        example of how our Ambassador acted? I think in Nicaragua some years earlier
                        when there was a bad earthquake, he and his wife wouldn't allow anybody to
                        use their house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That was in 1972. We didn't have any situation like that. Of course we had
                    a career Ambassador in Guatemala and a very fine one. One of the things which
                    made it such a rewarding experience was that there wasn't anything of that kind.
                    We had the military and AID and the embassy all working together. There wasn't
                    the feeling that anybody was letting the side down, or refusing to make their
                    best effort in the catastrophe. I think it was really an outstanding case of
                    cooperation and coordination among all U.S. government elements. I thought at
                    the time that there should have been a greater recognition of it by the
                    Department. Of course there is no question that it loomed larger being on the
                    scene in Guatemala than it undoubtedly loomed from the perspective of the
                    Potomac. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1977, where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>JONES: Back to Washington, I was selected for the National War College, one of
                    those buttons you are supposed to push on the way up in the career. My intention
                    was to request a tour in the Department after the War College assignment, since
                    we were going to have to move the whole family to Washington for the year of the
                    War College and we didn't want to have to move again afterwards. We decided that
                    I would drive back to Washington—I'm not sure precisely why, part of it was that
                    we had a dog. There was a certain amount of looting and breaking into houses
                    that was taking place in the disorganized atmosphere after the earthquake, so my
                    wife decided that we ought to get a dog to protect the household. So we found
                    this Doberman that had been born the night of the earthquake, and we had to get
                    her back to Washington, and as you know the Department doesn't pay for the
                    transport of pets. No question that part of it was because it sounded like a
                    very adventurous and fun thing to do, so I drove from Guatemala to Washington
                    with the dog. The rest of the family sensibly flew. [laughter] That was fun. I
                    stopped off in Texas and visited my mother and then came on to Washington. I
                    started classes at the War College in August 1977. It was a good year, I enjoyed
                    the association with my military colleagues. There were a number of other
                    foreign service people as well, but the great majority were military. I have
                    always worked well with the U.S. military and I think that one of the things
                    that has hurt the State Department in Washington, has been that it as a whole
                    does not work well with the Defense Department. That obviously doesn't apply to
                    everybody, but there is a lot of ignorance and misunderstanding about the
                    military and a lot of deliberate avoidance of having anything to do with the
                    Pentagon. I wish that every officer could go through the War College or some
                    similar experience, I think it would be good for the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In particular I think, our generation of officers for the
                        most part was male and a lot of us had military experience which at least
                        exposed us to it and for the most part we understood what the military was
                        about. But I think a newer generation has come along, out of the academic
                        world, where it is very easy to be contemptuous of the military, which is a
                        very bad mistake.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, yes. There was a very fine foreign service officer named John
                    Bushnell, for whom I worked. He was the Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Latin American Affairs during the Carter administration. I know for a fact that
                    Bushnell is a conservative, in terms of his personal inclinations, but he was a
                    highly capable, professional officer. From his perspective he was simply
                    carrying out Carter administration policy. He made a lot of enemies in the
                    Pentagon, I think simply because he did not know how to deal with the Pentagon.
                    He didn't know how to build his relationships with them, and create a separation
                    between the relationship and the policy. The policy might be to stop doing
                    certain things, and to cut your programs, and stay out of Latin America, etc.
                    But you can convey those in such a way that you can keep a mutual respect and
                    relationship going. I think it was fundamentally those enemies that he made in
                    the Pentagon during that period, which prevented him from getting the
                    Ambassadorship that he had earned and deserved. He was high up on the Reagan
                    administration's hit list when it came in. But that's another story.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>I enjoyed the year at the War College and did my paper, a sort of thesis that
                    they have you write, on nuclear nonproliferation. I really wanted to get back
                    into that field. I came out of the War College in May 1978, and not a single one
                    of the foreign service officers there (I think there were 17 of us altogether)
                    had an onward assignment. The Department in its usual competence at personnel
                    administration, knowing that it had 17 people over there who were going to be
                    graduating in May 1978, and were going to be available, and that they were going
                    to have to do something with them on that entirely predictable date, did
                    nothing. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came out of the senior seminar in June 1975 and was more
                        or less told to go and find myself a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's essentially—I don't know if anybody ever told me that, but it was
                    obviously what they expected me to do. So that's what I did. I could not find
                    any opening in the nonproliferation field. I really did not want to go back to
                    ARA, I was still trying to keep myself from being absolutely typed and
                    classified as an ARA type and nothing else. But John Bushnell called me in and
                    talked to me about jobs. He was the only person who had something to offer. So I
                    took the job as deputy director of an office called Regional Political Programs,
                    which was a strange name because we didn't have any political or other programs
                    to administer. It was what in other bureaus was called Regional Political
                    Affairs. We did the sort of global crosscutting issues, we dealt with issues
                    that came up in the U.N. relating to Latin America, and narcotics and fisheries.
                    The bureau's labor advisor was in the office. But above all we handled military
                    assistance and military sales to Latin America. We had an army Colonel who was
                    seconded from the military and was on duty in the office. I found that the
                    tendency had been, and my observation is that it's gone back to being that way,
                    to give everything to the Colonel. Nobody in the foreign service understood and
                    really wanted anything to do with military stuff, the idea was that you would
                    get this Colonel and you would dump it all on him and not give it a further
                    thought. I thought that our military assistance program was a major component of
                    our foreign policy and what we did with it, how big it was going to be, what
                    countries we would put the money into, was very much a foreign policy issue.
                    John Bushnell felt the same way, so between us we raised the profile
                    considerably of interest and involvement with military assistance issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Also tied in with that was the munitions list, the Department has an office of
                    munitions control, whose job it is to administer the munitions list—a
                    Congressionally-mandated list of products that require a State Department
                    license for export overseas. These are not government-to-government sales, but
                    sales by U.S. private firms. It's an unusual function, because there are very
                    few other things where the Department has a legal role, a legal responsibility,
                    visas obviously being one, the whole consular function. The policy with regard
                    to other kinds of exports is entirely in the hands of the Commerce Department.
                    At some point in the dim past, responsibility for the munitions list was put
                    into the State Department. It covered all kinds of arms and ammunition, but a
                    lot of other things, such as helicopters, aircraft, tear gas, anything that
                    could remotely serve a military or law enforcement function, or might be
                    converted into a military function. Of course the Carter administration was then
                    in office and there was a lot of interest in why are we supplying tear gas which
                    is being used by military dictatorships in Latin America to quell mobs and
                    anyone can pick up a can and see “made in the U.S.A.” on it. That, word for
                    word, is an argument I frequently had to answer. So we had some very difficult
                    decisions to make on munitions list sales. The whole thing was very chaotic. The
                    Office of Munitions Control badly wanted some guidance from the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs, yet it had been getting almost no guidance. You had a
                    huge backlog of cases on which it had been unable to any answer at all.</p>
                <p>I spent at least half my time in RPP, if not more, on military issues and
                    military related issues. I found it quite interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular cases that come to mind, like
                        jets to Chile, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The details are fuzzy now, but we certainly did wrestle with—apart from
                    the question of the acceptability of the recipient government; in the Carter
                    administration, by and large, if the government was a military dictatorship they
                    got very little out of us. We were mostly engaged in closing off loopholes and
                    doorways. But apart from that issue, there was also the issue of was it in the
                    U.S. interest, even if the government is a democracy, like Venezuela for example
                    or Mexico which was civilian government, was it in our interest to supply them
                    with our latest and most sophisticated weapons? Aircraft were the thorniest
                    issue, because they were very expensive. Were we justified in letting these
                    countries spend billions of dollars on acquisitions of the very latest aircraft?
                    Aren't we simply being an accomplice in wasting their people's money? And
                    helping to proliferate the spread of weaponry around the world, shouldn't we be
                    doing something different?</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>In fact, the very first activity that I was engaged in after leaving the War
                    College, was something called the US-Soviet Conventional Arms Talks (CAT), which
                    I think is fair to say, were largely the brainchild of Leslie Gelb who had been
                    a New York Times correspondent, but had come into the Carter administration as
                    the Director of Political-Military Affairs. He and some other political
                    appointee associates felt that as a parallel to the efforts that were going on
                    toward limitation of nuclear weapons, that at least an exploration ought to take
                    place of whether it was possible to limit the spread of conventional weapons.
                    Which would obviously require the cooperation of other countries and the place
                    to start was with the Soviet Union, because if you couldn't get the Soviet Union
                    on board then you would always be subject to the argument that if we restrain
                    ourselves then the Soviets will walk in and undercut us.</p>
                <p>So we had two sessions of talks with them, one in Helsinki in July 1978, and one
                    in Mexico City in December 1978. They were not getting very far, it's not at all
                    clear that they would have ever gotten anywhere because the Russians gave every
                    indication that they thought this was one of the more bizarre ideas that the
                    Americans had ever brought to them. I think they had a hard time figuring out
                    why we were doing it. I'm sure the communists had a field day trying to think up
                    Machiavellian motives for us in having raised this whole issue. I think they
                    could see very little, if any, advantage to the Soviet Union. Whereas with
                    regard to limiting nuclear weaponry, the advantage to the Soviet Union was
                    obvious—keep others from achieving equality with the nuclear powers and possibly
                    threatening the nuclear powers—it was not so obvious in conventional weaponry.
                    When the talks broke down, however, they broke down not because of the Soviet
                    Union, but because of bickering within the administration. While we were in
                    Mexico City, Zbigniew Brzezinski had either not focused much on this activity or
                    saw something in the reporting of what we were talking about that really set him
                    off. He got the authority to in effect to tell Gelb to close off the talks and
                    come home. That was exactly what we did, a very gloomy and discouraged U.S.
                    delegation, leaving behind very puzzled Mexicans who had had great hopes for
                    this move toward greater U.S./Soviet detente and couldn't really believe that it
                    was falling apart in front of their eyes. There were no further talks; Gelb
                    fought very intensely from Mexico to try to keep them alive but once the
                    decision had been taken and he was ordered home, he just dropped the whole idea.
                    There were no further such talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were working on trying to control the flow of arms into
                        Latin America, what about the role of particularly the French, but also the
                        British and other arms producers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>JONES: I think Gelb's strategy was that if you ever succeeded in working
                    something out with the Russians that then you could turn to the Western
                    Europeans and sort of shame them into agreeing to something similar. To bring
                    about some restraint on their sales, which were very much a factor. Apart from
                    Peru which was buying Soviet arms and obviously Cuba, Russian arms sales in
                    Latin America were not a problem anywhere else. The suppliers of arms were
                    ourselves and the Western Europeans. The Latin Americans themselves made some
                    efforts in the direction of limiting arms purchases from time to time. In fact,
                    there had been some just prior to this U.S. effort and we were hoping to build
                    on those Latin American initiatives. But those didn't come to anything either,
                    because it was just as difficult to agree on restraint from the purchaser's side
                    as it was from the supplier's side. [laughter] Because it required that your
                    neighbors also agree to restrain their purchases. The net result of all the U.S.
                    efforts at encouraging Latin restraint was that some things were delayed, some
                    purchases that would have been made a little sooner were put off for a few
                    years, but that is the most that you can say about Latin American military
                    expansion. The latest fighter aircraft eventually got to Latin America.</p>
                <p>I think disarmament initiatives are always worth trying because I think they do
                    save money and all armaments are a waste of money if you can possibly avoid
                    them. But for us to decide unilaterally, as we were frequently being asked to do
                    in the Carter administration, that on behalf of a moral crusade we would offer
                    them the F-5 in order to try and keep them from buying the F-16, or its French
                    equivalent, was more than a little silly, because we were trying to substitute
                    our own judgment for theirs. There was certainly a case for if it were a
                    military government, not selling them anything at all. But if it was a civilian
                    government like Venezuela or Mexico for example, to try to veto, to overrule
                    their own sovereign decisions about what they were going to buy for their armed
                    forces, was in the end unsuccessful and it accomplished nothing for us to try to
                    stop them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these regional issues, where did narcotics land? Was it
                        a big thing at this time, or was it still in its infancy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Compared to today it was still in its infancy. It was certainly growing,
                    but it was not—none of these other issues that my office was concerned with
                    consumed anywhere near the time or attention that the military issues did. We
                    had an occasional fishing boat that was seized or the occasional narcotics issue
                    that came up. But most of our time (I was in the office from 1978 - 1982) was
                    spent on the military. After the Reagan administration came in in January 1981,
                    even though a number of the Carter administration policies were reversed, there
                    was still a lot of activity, a lot of focus on the whole military assistance
                    area. We were becoming increasingly involved in El Salvador and the Congress was
                    fearful that we were going to become far too involved. The issues of how much
                    military assistance was going to go to El Salvador and what the Congress would
                    permit and what it wouldn't was a very large issue.</p>

                        coming in, over all the years that one is dealing with diplomatic history
                        and the post World War thing, this seems to have been almost one of the most
                        hostile takeovers in ARA. Did you feel that at your level? Can you explain
                        how you viewed this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It didn't effect me personally, but I could certainly see it. I think the
                    Reagan administration to a very large extent felt that they were conducting a
                    hostile takeover. They did such extraordinary things like informing Assistant
                    Secretary Bowdler that he was to not be in his office after 12:00 noon on
                    January 20th, he could be somewhere else in the building since he was still in
                    the foreign service and they didn't have the legal authority to kick him out of
                    the service, but he was not to be in ARA for one minute after that—as if he were
                    a traitor or had embezzled funds or something, it was a total failure to
                    understand the professional role of the foreign service. The ironic thing was
                    that so many of us professionals had resented and griped and swore about the
                    Carter administration and its political appointees and the naive and
                    inexperienced behavior in which they all too often indulged. There was by no
                    means a feeling that we were unable to work with the Reagan administration or
                    unable to do what they wanted us to do. I'm sure that there were a lot of
                    foreign service people who voted for Reagan and were delighted to see the change
                    come. But the atmosphere was very much that nobody here could be trusted.
                    Bushnell had been approved by the Carter White House to go as Ambassador to
                    Chile, and George Landau, who was then in Chile, was to go to Guatemala, and the
                    Guatemalans delayed for months in granting agr�ment for Landau because the
                    Guatemalan military were very hopeful that Reagan was going to win the election
                    and they wouldn't have to take a Carter Ambassador, they could get someone more
                    to their liking. So they finally granted agr�ment the day before the election,
                    knowing that it couldn't possibly go through until after the election. But after
                    the election of course, all plans for people, career and non-career, that Carter
                    had named as Ambassadors went out the window. Bushnell became the Acting
                    Assistant Secretary on Bowdler's removal and was there for the first six months
                    or so and he had some ties to Alexander Haig who was the new Secretary of State.
                    He had known him in some previous incarnation and therefore had hopes that his
                    appointment was going to go through, if not to Chile than to somewhere. But the
                    opposition to him was too intense and did not work out. He eventually went out
                    as DCM in Argentina. Fortunately, the people that the Reagan administration
                    brought in were very good career professionals, I shudder to think what would
                    have happened if we had gotten political appointees, but Tom Enders came in as
                    Assistant Secretary and Steve Bosworth as Principal Deputy. They were extremely
                    good. Enders was responsible for getting through the Caribbean Basin Initiative
                    (CBI) that is a key component of our economic policies in the Latin American
                    area to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>But there were all sorts of people who were injured as a result of the change of
                    administrations. James Cheek who was another Deputy Assistant Secretary in ARA
                    eventually went off as DCM in Nepal. [laughter] Then as Charg� in Ethiopia,
                    there was a long period where we didn't have relations at the Ambassadorial
                    level. Then finally in the Bush administration, which had no interest in the
                    Reaganite grudges, he became Ambassador to the Sudan. Then he was on the verge
                    of retirement and Clinton came in and sent him off as Ambassador to Argentina.
                    The climate of vengeance and politization of appointments at that time was worse
                    than I have ever seen it. Fortunately, the worst elements didn't succeed. There
                    was something called the Santa Fe group that was floating around and had done
                    papers of the most extreme kind of right wing ideas about Latin America.
                    Although some of their members were kind of tolerated on the fringes of the
                    administration, they never succeeded, thanks to adroit handling by people like
                    Enders, in getting into key policy jobs. At least in State; Defense was another
                    matter.</p>

                    the United Nations] decided to do a tour of Latin America, ostensibly for the
                    purpose of consulting on U.N. issues which there was some precedent for, and I
                    got tapped to go with her. They had originally hoped to send one of the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries and the one they wanted to send was having a wedding in
                    the family and other people weren't available, so I was asked if I could go. So
                    I followed her around the continent from Venezuela to Uruguay, to Argentina, to
                    Chile, Peru and Ecuador. On a personal level I liked her, she certainly was a
                    very feisty lady, and a very intelligent person as well. A lot of us in the
                    career service had the feeling that we were being whip-sawed by a pendulum. On
                    the one hand we had gone through the Carter administration which in its worst
                    moments and its worst people were pressing to have the most moralistic kind of
                    foreign policy regardless of the interest of the United States, it wouldn't have
                    anything to do with countries it didn't like, even if we had very strong reasons
                    for having something to do with them. Then the pendulum swung to the opposite
                    extreme and here we were with people who seemed to have no moral distinctions at
                    all. [laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Uruguay stands out most sharply in my mind, we had a meeting with I think the
                    acting foreign minister, who took the occasion to complain to Ambassador
                    Kirkpatrick about the presence of a State Department desk officer at some sort
                    of public forum in Washington, in which Uruguayan exiles had participated. I was
                    just burning with the desire to tell him, “It's none of your damn business who a
                    State Department officer associates with in the United States. How dare you try
                    to tell us who we can talk to, and what public events we can go to.” [laughter]
                    But of course I kept my mouth shut and said nothing, and unfortunately neither
                    did Ambassador Kirkpatrick. As far as I know the desk officer did not suffer
                    from that, she didn't try to follow up on it. The desire to restore good
                    relations with these crummy military dictatorships was so strong that the most
                    outrageous kind of comments—the best conversation of all was with the president
                    of Uruguay. Uruguay was at that time in effect a military government, it had a
                    civilian president, but the military was in fact running things. This gentleman
                    was way up in his '80s and he complained about Lech Walesa [the Polish
                    anti-communist leader] because he was a union leader and it was the coming to
                    power of these dangerous labor leaders that was a sign of the decline and fall
                    of civilization. [laughter] Mrs. Kirkpatrick didn't say anything that one
                    either. It was that kind of bizarre thing. We got to Chile (where I later
                    served) and someone who was to become my very good friend, Maximo Pacheco, and
                    some other human rights leaders wanted to call on her at her hotel and she
                    refused to see them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I think you could say that for the Latin Americanists it was the most
                    severe test possible of our professionalism. We used to pride ourselves, like
                    all career public servants, on being able to serve the government of the day.
                    But we had never before been subjected to this kind of a swing between the
                    governments of the day [laughter] from night to day, from black to white.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>Q: Today is September 30, 1996. George, let's talk about your impression of how
                    Tom Enders operated and anything dealing with him when he was Assistant
                    Secretary for ARA. JONES: Well, it's a funny thing, I got along very well with
                    the people who inspired the most terror in the State Department. I thought in
                    fact for a long time that I could get along with just about anybody, and we'll
                    come in a few minutes to the time when I found out that was not the case. But
                    John Bushnell who was the senior deputy during the Carter administration, a lot
                    of people could not get along with and in fact the story has it that some of the
                    enemies he made within the service, subsequently opposed and successfully
                    torpedoed his nomination by President Bush to go as Ambassador to Costa Rica,
                    which I think is disgraceful, but there we are. Tom Enders replaced Bowdler and
                    Bushnell as Acting Assistant Secretary in mid-1981. Enders brought in Steve
                    Bosworth as his principal deputy, who was an extremely nice guy, very popular
                    with everybody. But Enders had a reputation for being very, very demanding to
                    work for, and he was. It became almost a habit—I tried to get home most nights
                    by 7:00, and broke up a car pool over my inability to get out of the office
                    sooner. But when I would get home just as a ritual I would walk in the door at
                    7:00 and the phone would ring and it would Marge Fitzgerald, Tom's secretary
                    telling me that Tom wanted to speak with me. There he was with some matter or
                    another that he wanted to task me with, or find out the status of. [laughter] It
                    didn't matter to him when—I began to wonder after a while if he wasn't sending
                    me a message that he wasn't supposed to be calling me at home, that I was still
                    supposed to be in the office, then he wouldn't have to go to this trouble. But
                    he never said that, so I kept trying to get home at a reasonable hour. I admired
                    Enders, as I admired Bushnell, I admired both of them tremendously. Both were
                    extremely bright people in a service full of extremely bright people. I think
                    Enders' accomplishments were extraordinary. Enders knew how to move the
                    bureaucracy and get the bureaucracy to go along with the things that he wanted
                    to do. He was largely responsible for the Caribbean Basin Initiative which was
                    sort of sold to the White House as a measure to fight communism in Central
                    America. But it had very little to do with fighting communism and a lot to do
                    with promoting trade ties between the whole Caribbean basin and the United
                    States. I think that he did as well as anyone could in the Malvinas crisis given
                    the suicidal determination of the Argentines on one side and Margaret Thatcher
                    on the other. The Reagan administration came in—one of many chips on its
                    shoulders was that the State Department had stood in the way of the Pentagon and
                    had prevented it from doing many good and noble things including “winning the
                    war in Central America”. So Enders came in aware of this and concerned about the
                    ARA/Pentagon relationship. It was a matter of some satisfaction to me that
                    although I had been there during almost the whole Carter administration, I was
                    held over and stayed on for almost a year and a half into the Reagan
                    administration. Because I had built the contacts with the Pentagon and had good
                    relationships through all of the levels at the Pentagon on the military issues
                    affecting Latin America. So the operation was going smoothly and continued to
                    run smoothly despite major shifts in emphasis with the new administration. I was
                    even asked if I would like to head a combination of my office, Regional
                    Political Affairs, and the Policy, Planning and Coordination office. I said yes,
                    but pointed out that the head of PPC, Luigi Einaudi, was a major asset to the
                    bureau and that they ought to find some way to continue to use him if they went
                    ahead with amalgamation. I don't know what the reason was, but they did not go
                    ahead with the amalgamation at that time. Some years later those two offices
                    were combined and are a single office today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any emanations from within the service
                        from our Ambassadors in the field in Latin America to Enders? How were
                        relations with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>JONES: Of course there were a number of firings and resignations, we talked about
                    this before, because of the transition from Carter to Reagan. Bob White who was
                    the Ambassador to El Salvador resigned very spectacularly, a big blast at the
                    administration, and I think quite unjustifiably. Bob's a friend of mine, but the
                    implication of his statement was that the State Department had to take his
                    recommendations or else and that's never been my view of an Ambassador's role.
                    [laughter] The State Department has an obligation to listen to an Ambassador's
                    recommendations, but nowhere is it written that they have to accept them.
                    Clearly he was not going to be a fit with the Reagan administration under any
                    circumstances and I think he should have quietly left when he was asked to
                    leave.</p>
                <p>After the initial shakedown, how did people feel about Enders? I'm not sure that
                    I have any clear feel for that. Frank McNeil, who was my first boss in Costa
                    Rica, I think got along with him very well. The whole history of the Reagan
                    administration is that so much more was going on behind the curtain than in
                    front of the curtain, and I think that had to have been frustrating to a number
                    of the senior people. This was the beginning of the infamous troika between the
                    Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs and his counterparts in the
                    operations directorate at the CIA, and the NSC at the White House. That group of
                    three is where the really important decisions were being made. The Inter-Agency
                    Group, or IG, had existed for some time as a vehicle for interagency
                    coordination. The Reagan administration came up with something called the
                    Restricted Inter-Agency Group, or RIG - a very suggestive name. But this group
                    of three was an unofficial cabal even smaller than the RIG.</p>
                <p>As I said, I think that had to be frustrating to people in the field. Some of the
                    Ambassadors I'm sure, fitted into that better than others. There was one
                    Ambassador in Central America whom I won't name, because I have no way of
                    knowing if this is true or not, he was said to sing a very different tune in
                    messages that were sent through CIA channels to the NSC, than he sang in his
                    open cables that were sent to the State Department. [laughter] Whether true or
                    not, that kind of atmosphere was very characteristic of Central American policy
                    under Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that the Reagan administration had—I mean the
                        people who supported Reagan were claiming that the State Department was sort
                        of restraining the Pentagon, the military, from doing more in Latin America,
                        this was sort of the rhetoric. Yet when Casper Weinberger came in, if there
                        was anything Casper Weinberger as Secretary of Defense became known for
                        later on, it was to make sure that the military didn't do anything that
                        might cause controversy. Was this just right-wing Republican rhetoric, or
                        had the Pentagon been thirsting to do something? And was there any change
                        when the Reagan administration came in, during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>JONES: First of all, there were some extreme fringe people who really wanted to
                    intervene militarily, in the style of Guatemala 1954, in Central America. Some
                    of those were kept out of the administration, given consultant positions, like
                    the Santa Fe group that I mentioned before—people floated around the edges of
                    ARA, as consultants, but who never really had anything to do with policy. There
                    were others who were hired, Fred Ikl� at the Pentagon, and there was a retired
                    General whose name I have forgotten, who was Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
                    for Policy, or something like that, who I considered to be very far around the
                    bend. Then what followed (over the entire history of the Reagan administration)
                    was a struggle for power. Tom Enders ultimately fell victim to that, I don't
                    know the inner details of that, and I'm sure its a gross over- simplification,
                    the public version that came to be known. But basically he put his job on the
                    line for a two-track policy in Central America, a policy of yes you increase our
                    military presence, you acquire credibility through additional military presence,
                    but you simultaneously pursue a diplomatic track to work out a solution to
                    Central American problems. The two-track idea was such an anathema to the
                    extreme right-wing, that when he said “Either you support this or you have my
                    resignation,” they said “Let's have your resignation.” The whole history of the
                    Reagan administration was a history of—every Washington administration is full
                    of knives in the back, and bureaucratic maneuvering, but the Reagan
                    administration surely had the championship in that department. Never was there
                    an administration in Washington with as much covert goings-on of all kinds, both
                    official covert and unofficial covert actions going on in every department in
                    the whole administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Let me add one thing to what I was saying, because I didn't really answer
                    your question. As I've hinted, a lot of the maneuvering was about whether to
                    unleash the military. I shouldn't speak for Tom Enders, but Tom was a
                    professional (I think he was very conservative) and he saw very clearly that
                    there was no military solution to Central America. Perhaps in theory we could
                    have funded another 1954 type intervention, but it might very well have made the
                    problems worse instead of better. Of course he also saw, as we all saw, that it
                    was one thing what the administration wanted and another thing what the Congress
                    wanted. Those of us who were public servants were bound to obey the law,
                    although not everybody on the extreme right took that view. So there was a lot
                    of maneuvering, and I don't think it's unfair to Enders to say that he was among
                    the most skillful maneuverers, he could appear militant, and to be cheering the
                    wilder fringe on, while at the same time saying quietly, I'm all in favor of
                    this but there is one small problem, there is a law which prevents us from
                    having more than 55 U.S. military advisors in El Salvador. Some practical things
                    were worked out and to some degree I was part of them. Flying people in and out
                    so that you never actually had more than 55 on the ground at any one time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enders must have been quite used to this, because we were
                        doing this in Cambodia and in Laos. There were only so many advisors that

                        they would fly out again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I remember, right at the beginning of the administration, I had a meeting
                    with Richard Burt who was the new head of Political-Military Affairs in the
                    Department, and the purpose was to discuss a U.S. Navy ship visit that was going
                    to be made in Central America. One of the issues related to it was how visible
                    the Marines on board the ship were going to be. I reminded him of the long
                    history of the U.S. Marine Corps in Central America and the Caribbean basin and
                    that if the United States didn't remember it, the Latin Americans certainly did.
                    And he cut off the conversation very sharply by saying “They're going to have to
                    get used to the presence of the Marines because there is going to be a lot more
                    of it.” [laughter]</p>

                        in the practical situation it just shows the mind-set.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It shows a mind-set and he was right. [laughter] Because there was a lot
                    more of military presence in Central America under Reagan. We had those
                    battleships, at an enormous cost we took the Iowa and New Jersey out of moth
                    balls, just so they could sail up and down the coast of Central America and we
                    could look macho. But I think it was the efforts of a lot of very professional
                    people like Tom Enders and Steve Bosworth, to try to keep this within bounds and
                    to keep it from getting totally wild, and above all, to keep the diplomatic
                    track alive. To keep searching for a political solution to what was a political
                    problem, not a military problem.</p>

                        1981, was it? It was early on in the Reagan administration. What role did
                        you play and what you were seeing going on back then?</hi>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>JONES: Very little. I did a couple of papers, but I was not a central player in
                    that issue. Enders certainly was and his Southern Cone staff, but I was watching
                    it from outside. It was an interesting—if what I think is true, then the role of
                    the military in Latin America has permanently changed. Some historian may find
                    this to be true 50 years from now when he or she writes a book on the period of
                    military dominance in Latin American politics. I think the Malvinas will
                    naturally suggest itself as the dramatic final chapter. It was perhaps not the
                    most meaningful final chapter. I think the military were really brought down by
                    their inability to deal with the economic and social issues that came to the
                    fore in Latin America, as the society changed under them, they found they were
                    no longer able to run it as they were before. But the great dramatic scene in
                    which they overreached was the Malvinas. I remember a reporting cable very early
                    on, it was from our defense attach� in Buenos Aires and he was reporting that
                    all of the foreign defense attach�s had been invited in for a briefing by the
                    Argentine military on the progress of the war against our NATO ally. You could
                    tell that the guy writing this had the feeling that he was trapped in an unreal
                    world. [laughter] The total lack of understanding of the Argentine military, of
                    what they were getting into and where the sympathies of the world community were
                    going to lie, was just extraordinary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from—you were looking at Latin
                        America as the big picture as opposed to one country. On this
                        Falklands/Malvinas thing—the way the Argentine government was going about
                        things was outrageous as far as dealing with its own people, and maybe
                        stupid as far as how they conducted the attempt to seize the islands. Yet
                        it's a Latin American country and you've got the British coming in and
                        exerting their “colonial” authority over the islands, which has to arose
                        certain passions. But were you getting a public versus a private posture
                        from the other countries? How was this playing, because this was important
                        to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: One of the interesting and sometimes baffling aspects of the Latin
                    American world view, is the repeated daily references to the sister republics. A
                    tremendous amount of lip-service is paid in Latin America to their sister Latin
                    American republics. The Spanish in particular, have played to this and there is
                    now an Ibero-American summit that brings together the Spanish, the Portuguese,
                    and the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies, and carefully excludes the
                    Colossus of the North. But, it is both real and unreal at the same time, I think
                    there are ways and circumstances in which there is a real sense of brotherhood
                    of the Latin American community, but when it comes down to anything that really
                    costs money, time and effort, [laughter] countries look at their own particular
                    interests, not some sense of Latin American brotherhood. So yes, there was
                    sympathy for Argentina. It was mostly at the lip-service level. Latin Americans
                    all say Malvinas, they don't say Falklands. They stood together on a vote at the
                    U.N. which doesn't cost anything, a vote with the sister republic of
                    Argentina—but there was no effect on U.S. relations with Latin America as a
                    result of Malvinas. I think the Brazilians and the Chileans were rather pleased
                    if anything, to see Argentina get a comeuppance. Not to mention to see
                    Argentina's military strength reduced.</p>

                        Chile, it's probably of the same ilk. When did you leave and where were you
                        off to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Enders asked me if I would interview with our new Ambassador to Brazil,
                    Tony Motley, to be his DCM, but I talked to my wife and she was not enthusiastic
                    about going to Brasilia, which has a reputation as a very isolated place in the
                    middle of nowhere in central Brazil. She wanted to be closer to the United
                    States because our older kids were moving into college and we wanted to be where
                    the travel back and forth was easier. After I turned down Brazil, Enders, who
                    was clearly looking around for people who could control or at least
                    counter-balance these political Ambassadors who were being thrust upon him, had
                    me interview with John Gavin, who was Ambassador to Mexico. That one I did
                    actually get to the interview stage with, but I did not “ring Gavin's bells”.
                    Enders, who was considerably frustrated with me by this point, finally asked if
                    I would go as DCM to Costa Rica where yet another political Ambassador was going
                    to be named, so I said yes and we went off to Costa Rica in August 1982.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Until July 1985. As it turned out, the first year that I was there was
                    under Ambassador Frank McNeil. Both of us had anticipated that it was going to
                    be a lot less. [time] There was a delay in naming his successor, and I suspect
                    it was because Enders was fighting the appointment, but as a result of that I
                    got a full year with Frank which I was delighted to have. He was a first rate
                    Ambassador and his wife was Costa Rican, which is very unusual. But as a result
                    of that he had total entree to Costa Rican society and knew it backwards and
                    forwards and he was a very confident manager of the embassy as well. So, I could
                    not have asked for a better first year as a DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about that first year first? What was the
                        situation in Costa Rica when you got there and what were the American
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>JONES: We always used to say that Costa Rica was in Central America but not of
                    Central America. Costa Rica is a most unusual Latin American country. The easy
                    pop psychology explanation is that it was settled by small farmers from Spain;
                    if there were slaves brought in there were very few, so you did not have the
                    large plantations and the slave/peasant kind of culture that you got in most of
                    the Latin American countries. You had small farmers who farmed their own land
                    themselves. As a result, you had elected civilian governments, really throughout
                    Costa Rica's history. The Costa Ricans, despite the fact that they are quite a
                    small country, a couple of million people, Costa Rica has had quite a different
                    relationship with the United States, which was very pleasant for an American to
                    be in. In most Latin American countries you get this love/hate relationship, the
                    chip on the shoulder relationship. Because the Latins have a sense of, the easy
                    word is inferiority but that doesn't quite convey it, that they have not done as
                    well as the United States has done and they resent it, they are quite suspicious
                    that somehow the United States has taken advantage of them in the process, and
                    they are having various kinds of identity crises that make them very assertive
                    about their identity to foreign countries, especially the United States. At the
                    same time, they are very unsure about their identity internally.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica has none of that. Costa Ricans are very certain about their identity,
                    very proud of their history and as a result, totally relaxed in dealing with the
                    United States. I've never been in a country where there were as few hang-ups
                    about their relationship with the United States. Costa Rica at that time was THE
                    democracy in Central America. So it was the United States showcase, this was how
                    we would like the rest of Central America to be. To make sure of that we were
                    pouring in a very large amount of U.S. aid. The AID Mission was in the process
                    of being built up at that point and it was already larger than the embassy. I
                    don't remember the numbers now, but it became a huge mission—which created a
                    real problem of exercising any kind of control of it by the State Department.
                    But even though the Central Americans would like to be totally separated from
                    what was going on in the rest of Central America, inevitably they couldn't be,
                    and the United States was also unfortunately not really willing for them to be
                    totally separate. One of their problems is that they have traditionally been a
                    refuge for exiles from the other Central American countries, especially the
                    Nicaraguans with whom they share a border. You had Sandinista refugees living
                    there for years while the Somozas were in power in Nicaragua and then when the
                    Sandinistas came to power you had people from the right, and center, fleeing to
                    Costa Rica. Which of course enormously complicated their relations with
                    Nicaragua. Although the condition of their being there was that they not carry
                    out any kind of subversive activity from Costa Rican territory, that condition
                    became more and more difficult to enforce as time went on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the AID thing. When you're trying
                        to make a showcase out of a country, sometimes it's “Don't just stand there,
                        do something.” It tends to sometimes end up with either crack-pot ideas or
                        overdoing or something like that. In a country of only a couple of million
                        people I would think that this could be, I mean you were worried about the
                        economy of the country. What was your impression of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The view that I have come to is that large amounts of external aid are bad
                    for a country. I think we talked on an earlier tape about the Alliance for
                    Progress and the conviction that I had come to at that time, that President
                    Kennedy's very will intentioned notion that if you simply got together a
                    significant amount of resources and put it into any country, region, area, that
                    would lead to development, was just totally naive and wrong headed. We knew
                    enough by 1982, that if we had been doing things strictly for development
                    reasons we would have known not to try to put the large amounts of money into
                    Costa Rica. But we weren't doing it for development reasons, we were doing it
                    for political reasons. We wanted to support and sustain the Costa Rican
                    democracy and as I said, we wanted to make it a showcase. A lot of the money
                    simply went to support the Costa Rican budget, which means that we had very
                    little to show for it. We were dealing with a Costa Rican administration that I
                    admired greatly for its political skills, the administration of Luis Alberto
                    Monge, but it was not the best administered on the economic side, and I think
                    our aid didn't help it to be better administered, I think it simply gave
                    them—they were able to avoid the consequences of their actions because they had
                    these tremendous amounts of money coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this money that was coming in fostering corruption?
                        Did you think that was a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>JONES: I would certainly hope that it was not fostering corruption. It was a huge
                    administrative problem because the—I think I talked on the very first tape, I
                    first started off in the government working on the Public Law 480 program, and
                    its great utility as a program is that it generates counterpart. That is, the
                    American wheat (or whatever) is sold on the local market in country X for local
                    currency and so it produces that counterpart currency. I think that's a very
                    neat and useful tool if you're talking about a limited size program, because you
                    get double bang for the buck - you get wheat for people to eat and than you get
                    local currency to spend building infrastructure. But when we go in with large
                    balance of payments programs as we were doing in Colombia earlier and in Costa
                    Rica at the time that I was there, those US dollar inputs into the Costa Rican
                    budget also generated counterpart. So you had tremendous quantities of Costa
                    Rican currency that had to be programmed. Washington, the U.S. government
                    generally, took very little interest in what happened to the counterpart. Which
                    had its advantages and its disadvantages: one advantage was that the people in
                    the field had a great deal of latitude in how to program it. A disadvantage was
                    that you didn't have the usual amount of supervision from Washington as to what
                    was happening to the money. Washington's viewpoint was that it had spent dollars
                    which went into the Costa Rican government treasury, alleviating their shortage
                    of foreign exchange with which to pay for imports, that's all it was concerned
                    about. It wasn't concerned about what then happened to the Costa Rican currency
                    that was generated. The amounts were so huge that our AID Mission had a real
                    problem figuring out what to do with it all. One of the things that was done
                    with them was at the same time that we were building a new embassy, the AID
                    Mission was building an AID Mission building, considerably larger than the
                    embassy, and about two blocks away. They were building it with this counterpart
                    as one way to use up some of the money. Now of course the AID Mission has been
                    closed down and the building has been turned over to the Costa Rican government,
                    because actually it was Costa Rican money and whatever is done with it is Costa
                    Rican government property. This huge building in this little of town of San
                    Jose, Costa Rica. The Costa Ricans, I think, were very uncomfortable with many
                    aspects of Uncle Sam moving in on it and disturbing their quiet, tranquil,
                    largely agricultural society. As it happens, the AID Director during my time
                    went through a long and very painful investigation by the AID Inspector General
                    that effectively terminated his career. He remained in the service for some
                    years after that, but he never headed another mission. Without knowing any of
                    the details of the case, I feel quite confidant that there wasn't any corruption
                    in the AID Mission. But I think that the investigation grew out of the large
                    amounts of money that were being handled by the Mission, through the failure of
                    Washington agencies to oversee what was being done with the counterpart, and out
                    of a certain amount of hubris on the part of people in the field, that as a
                    result they could do anything they wanted to with the counterpart. I think all
                    were very well intentioned things, but they may not all have been absolutely
                    consistent with AID regulations. We did lots of scholarships with them, there
                    were some very innovative things which were done with the Costa Rican AID money.
                    I don't want to leave the impression that it wasn't of any use, but it was far
                    our of proportion of what the society could usefully absorb in the time frame
                    that we're talking about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still during the Frank McNeil time, whom for the record I
                        have interviewed (at least in part, I don't think we've finished). Here
                        you've got the Reagan administration white-hot mad about what's happening in
                        Nicaragua with the Sandinistas. You have a very activist head of the CIA,
                        William Casey, who the feeling was that he would do anything he could, and
                        you've got this state of Costa Rica with a nice long border with Nicaragua.
                        From your perspective—this must have caused a problem, shall we say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: [laughter] Yes, indeed. When Frank McNeil was there it was less of a
                    problem, because of his superb relations with the Costa Ricans, because of his
                    understanding of what was possible and what was not possible in Costa Rica, and
                    his shrewd management of all the US Government agencies there. I remember the
                    head of CIA for the Western Hemisphere liked to fly around to places in his
                    private aircraft and land at night and go to the Ambassador's residence, never
                    come in to the Embassy itself, but go to the Ambassador's residence. I remember
                    sitting in on one such meeting with Frank and I don't remember the specifics
                    now, but the gist was, “Can't we push Costa Rica to do more?” and Frank was
                    patiently explaining what the limits were; that Costa Rica's support for
                    democracy was total, but that it did not want to get itself entangled with the
                    “tar baby” of the rest of Central America. In the summer of 1983, Tom Enders'
                    efforts to stave off Curt Winsor's appointment to Costa Rica failed. I think it
                    was about that same time that Tom himself was forced out. Maybe not that was not
                    entirely coincidental, in any event, Curt Winsor arrived. Maybe I should jump
                    ahead in the story and tell the end before I tell the beginning. Toward the end
                    of 1984, after Reagan's reelection, George Shultz went to Reagan and said that
                    he wanted to replace a whole list of Ambassadors who were incompetent in their
                    jobs. The bottom line of it was that either they went or he went. Although
                    Reagan was certainly being pushed by lots of other people to get rid of Shultz,
                    for whatever reasons he didn't want to—either he didn't want the political furor
                    that would be caused or he thought highly enough of Shultz to keep him on, and
                    he agreed to replace these Ambassadors. Funderburk in Romania was one of
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's now a Congressman for North Carolina, an extreme
                        right-winger.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>JONES: Right. They were all political appointees. They were all people that had
                    been foisted on Shultz by the pressure to name Reaganite Ambassadors. Of course
                    the view in Washington always is that an Ambassador is a very prestigious perk,
                    but it gets them out of Washington. So from the standpoint of all too many
                    senior political people, in all administrations, it doesn't matter how
                    incompetent an Ambassador is, how unqualified he may be, the point is that he's
                    far away in some other country that doesn't matter anyway, and if there is any
                    problem the State Department will take care of it. If it's beyond the beltway it
                    doesn't exist, is the philosophy. But Shultz had had enough. Winsor was one of
                    the ones on this list—I was in a car with him and we were going to some outlying
                    town in Costa Rica for a ceremony at an institute for training of private sector
                    managers (that some of this AID counterpart funding had gone into). It was not
                    the most comfortable car ride in the first place, since our relations were
                    already seriously strained by that point. But we got a call on the car radio
                    from his secretary saying that the desk officer had called from Washington and
                    had an urgent message to get to him. He asked what the message was and they
                    tried to delay giving it to him, but he insisted on having the message and he
                    was told that the message was that there was a story in the Washington Post that
                    you're among a group of Ambassadors that are being fired. [laughter] That did
                    not improve the rest of the car ride. [laughter] He went up to the U.S. and
                    tried to fight it, he called in all of his political contacts and was
                    unsuccessful. At one point he met with Kenneth Dam, the Deputy Secretary whom he
                    had known previously, and they agreed on a departure date of February 19, and so
                    he came back to the post, and gnashing his teeth began to make arrangements for
                    his departure. Then in came the telegram from the Department (the normal TM-1)
                    authorizing his departure from post and providing the appropriation numbers for
                    his expenses in connection with departure. As these telegrams always do, they
                    don't specify a day of the month they simply specify a month—transfer back to
                    the United States in February 1985. So he decided that this constituted an
                    authorization for him to stay until the end of February, he could depart on
                    February 28, just as well. So the 19th came and went and he was still there and
                    then one fine morning in came a telegram from Kenneth Dam to me, of course Dam
                    did not have the foggiest idea of who I was, but he had been told that somebody
                    named Jones was the DCM. He said that you are authorized to assume charge of the
                    Embassy. [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: [laughter] I don't know of any case like this in the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, obviously Dam was mad as hell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He was mad as hell, there was no question. [laughter] Of course there was
                    a long series of things which had made everybody in the Department mad as hell
                    at Winsor. This was sort of the last straw.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did he actually leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He left a few days later. I'm trying to remember—it wasn't a long time,
                    but it was something like a week from the time this telegram came in to the time
                    that he actually departed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A certain blessing is that February is a short month.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There you are, [laughter] it couldn't have gone on for too terribly long.
                    [laughter] He called me in and asked me how I was going to handle it, which must
                    have been extremely galling to him. I told him that I wanted to handle it was
                    quietly as I possibly could, which meant that he would stay in his office, and
                    he would stay in his house, he would retain his guards, everything would go on
                    just as it had before. Except that telegrams would have to go out under my name,
                    having been so instructed by the Acting Secretary of State. Also, I had to go
                    over to the Foreign Ministry and explain to the Vice Foreign Minister with whom
                    I had worked closely, that we were trying something new in diplomacy and the
                    Ambassador as he knew was preparing to leave but had a great deal of personal
                    things to take care of and so I was going ahead and taking over the Embassy for
                    all official purposes and the Ambassador would be leaving in a few days. I don't
                    know to what extent he swallowed it, he simply said fine and made no further
                    comment on it. Of course the Costa Ricans read the papers too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the beginning of when Curt Winsor was
                        named—in the first place could you give me some background on the gentleman
                        and also what you had heard about him before he came. Since apparently there
                        had been some problem of his getting appointed and then talk about the time
                        he was there, not only with him but also the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, I had not heard anything negative. I had heard that the Department
                    was fighting his appointment. The Reagan administration had this very peculiar
                    system of having the State Department nominate a candidate for every post, and
                    the White House political people would nominate a political candidate and then a
                    battle would ensue. [laughter] I don't know of any other administration that has
                    done it that way, but it just meant that there was always blood on the floor. I
                    have no idea who, but I'm sure that there was some poor soul who was being put
                    forward by the Department as a career candidate for the Costa Rica job. I had
                    not heard anything about Winsor. I knew he was a political appointee, that
                    didn't bother me, and when I saw his curriculum it was impressive. He had in
                    fact been a foreign service officer for four years when he came out of college.
                    He had never served overseas; just as I was, he had been assigned to the
                    Department as his initial tour. I think he did something else first, but then he
                    was put into Congressional relations, that would have been in the Nixon
                    administration. He enjoyed the political contacts that led to. Finally the time
                    came when he was to be assigned overseas and he decided he liked the politics
                    and didn't like the idea of going overseas so he resigned. At one point he was
                    working on Senator Dole's staff. He had a Ph.D. from American University,
                    written on Argentina. He was said to speak passable Spanish. He was a successful
                    businessman, the president of a coal mining company. As I said, it was an
                    impressive resume. The guy was, and is, an extremely nice guy, charming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very personable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Very personable. We got along very well in the initial weeks. If anything,
                    he was very humble about being new to being an Ambassador, and wanting to be
                    shown the ropes and so forth. It became apparent as we went along that he
                    totally lacked the absolute primary ingredient for being an Ambassador and that
                    is judgment. He simply had no ability to understand the wider ramifications of
                    what he did. Although he had a lot of sympathy and interest for Costa Rica, he
                    never had any understanding of Costa Rica. His whole view of the world was good
                    versus evil, there were guys with white hats and guys with black hats, and he
                    immediately seized onto that, once he identified who were the conservatives and
                    who were the right-wingers in Costa Rica, they became the white hats and all the
                    others were black hats. Very early on there was an incident involving the Costa
                    Rican Minister of Interior, his name was Angel Solano, and Solano was a leftist,
                    there was no question about it, and once Curt's mind had closed on that fact he
                    decided that Solano had to go and that it was his mission to get rid of him and
                    he began a campaign to do that. Finally I urged him to talk to Fernando Volio
                    who was Foreign Minister, and on the Central American issue Volio was as close
                    to being a hawk as you could get in Costa Rica. So Winsor felt Volio was an ally
                    and someone that we could rely on. He went to talk to Volio and Volio urged him
                    not to do it, not to press the campaign against Solano, that it would simply be
                    counter-productive. So with great regret he dropped that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how an Ambassador conducts a campaign to
                        get rid of a cabinet member?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>JONES: He in fact raised it with President Monge. But the question was how hard
                    he was going to press Monge on it, whether he was going to keep on raising it,
                    whether he would begin to hint that there might be consequences for the
                    relationship with the U.S. if he didn't get rid of Solano, etc. It's hard to say
                    whether he actually could have forced it if he had really gone all out, but I
                    think Volio was absolutely right, that even if he had succeeded in getting rid
                    of Solano, the damage he would have done to U.S. relations with the Monge
                    government would have been so severe that it would not have been worth it. So he
                    dropped that issue and I was feeling pretty proud of myself for having gotten
                    through this crisis and still in good relations with Winsor. That I had avoided
                    telling him that this was a stupid, cockamamie idea, I had kept my mouth shut
                    and I had simply urged him to seek advice at the right moment and it all turned
                    out well in the end. But the problems never stopped, there was just one thing
                    after another from then on. Incidentally, Monge eventually did drop Solano from
                    the cabinet, when he saw it was politically possible to do so without appearing
                    to cave under U.S. pressure.</p>
                <p>I remember at the very beginning there was an interesting incident in which we
                    received a telegram asking us to obtain landing clearance from the Costa Ricans
                    for a small U.S. government aircraft. It was going to land at a tiny airstrip
                    right up close to the Nicaraguan border. The passengers on board the plane, one
                    of them whose name meant nothing to me and the other one was Oliver North, which
                    rang a bell and I looked him up and yes indeed there was a Major Oliver North
                    who was on the NSC staff. I'm sure the other guy was CIA although I had no way
                    of checking that. I told Curt that this was extremely unusual and essentially
                    discourteous to the Ambassador that they would propose to come and land on his
                    turf without ever coming through San Jose and briefing the Ambassador and what
                    their mission was, etc., and I also thought that it was very disingenuous not to
                    identify North as an active duty military officer, nor reveal that he was on the
                    NSC staff. He thought that I was absolutely right, so we sent a telegram back
                    saying that before we could grant country clearance we would want the aircraft
                    to first come to San Jose and that Major North and the other traveler should
                    meet with the Ambassador, just to let them know that we had figured out who
                    North was. We heard nothing further. Years later it became perfectly clear that
                    this was one of the very early if not the earliest efforts of North and Casey to
                    find a staging point in Northern Costa Rica for the contra movement against the
                    Sandinistas.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>The most important incident of my time in Costa Rica involved the head of the
                    U.S. Southern Command, who at that time was General Paul Gorman, a gentleman
                    very much in tune with Reagan and Casey, unlike his predecessors and successors
                    for all of whom I have the highest respect, I think we had actually an
                    extraordinarily good row of people as heads of the Southern Command, but Paul
                    Gorman was an exception. It gives me some faith in the U. S. military that
                    several of the Southern Command Chiefs have gone on to be head of NATO, thank
                    god Gorman was not one of them. Gorman wanted to carry out some military
                    exercises in Northern Costa Rica, road building in particular, obviously in
                    order to make the Nicaraguans nervous. We'd had some U.S. military civic action
                    kind of things in the past in Costa Rica. There was a well-drilling exercise
                    which had taken place before my arrival and it had been very successful, it was
                    very much welcomed by the Costa Ricans. But this was a far different order of
                    things, I don't recall what the number of the troops was, but it was a
                    significant number of American troops who would be engaged in this exercise, a
                    big engineer detachment and all sorts of ancillary troops. I'm trying to
                    remember, I think upgrading and extending that airstrip on the border was part
                    of the project as well. Gorman came on a visit to sell this idea, there was a
                    meeting with him and then President Monge gave a lunch. The problem was that
                    neither Gorman nor Winsor—I don't think Gorman had any Spanish and Winsor's
                    Spanish was very limited as I discovered after he arrived. So virtually the only
                    person on the American side who understood what was being said at this lunch was
                    me. There was a Costa Rican interpreter there but the interpreter was not doing
                    a very good job, which in my experience Latin American government interpreters
                    often don't, in translating into a language not their own.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The crucial point was that Gorman wanted the soldiers who were on guard duty
                    around this engineer detachment to be armed and Monge said very clearly at the
                    lunch that the engineering detachment would be welcome but it could not be
                    armed. As a combination of the fact that this is not what Gorman wanted to hear
                    and the fact that the translator did not make it clear, Gorman went away
                    convinced (I didn't realize this at the time because he went directly from the
                    lunch to the airport and I didn't have a chance to talk to him) that he had sold
                    his deal. I talked to Washington on the phone and was told to report this in a
                    NODIS, a no-distribution telegram, which meant that I could not send it to
                    anyone else. This was part of the atmosphere in Washington, because there was so
                    much in-fighting going on and this struggle for power in the Reagan
                    administration, everybody was very anal-retentive about information. Of course
                    there are ways around it and it would have helped in the short run (it wouldn't
                    have helped in the long run) if I had just told our military guy to send the
                    same telegram but send it as a separate telegram to the Southern Command. I
                    didn't do that because it didn't occur to me, I could not conceive of ARA
                    wanting to keep Gorman in the dark on Gorman's issue. So we sent in the NODIS
                    telegram, Winsor was still in his trusting phase and so he accepted my version
                    of what had gone on. So we sent in the telegram with a request that Washington
                    retransmit it to the Southern Command. We found out later that had never been
                    done. So Gorman went on for a long period of time thinking that everything was
                    agreed to in Costa Rica. Then at some point he found out that it wasn't and
                    apparently went absolutely through the roof and blamed me for it. I found out
                    later, a friend of mine at CIA told me that Gorman had gone to Washington
                    telling everybody that the DCM was sabotaging his project.</p>
                <p>I was not at all surprised by what Monge said because it was absolutely
                    consistent with Costa Rica's tradition and views that they would not want armed
                    American soldiers a few miles from the Nicaraguan border. That would have been a
                    clear provocation to the Sandinistas and they did not want to provoke the
                    Sandinistas, who were capable of causing Costa Rica a lot of trouble. The Costa
                    Ricans often told us, “You Americans come and go, but we've got to live with
                    Nicaragua for time eternal, so we are not about to make bitter enemies out of
                    either side in the Nicaraguan conflict. They have lived here in exile before,
                    they will live here in exile again.” You also have to understand that Costa Rica
                    did not have an army, Costa Rica was very proud of the fact that it was the only
                    country with no army. They had a small national police force that performed some
                    army-like functions, border guards for example. In comparison with the military
                    capability of the Sandinistas, they were virtually defenseless. They weren't so
                    confidant of the Americans' ability to protect them that they wanted to go about
                    deliberately provoking a neighbor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was lots and lots going on. Not too long after he arrived, the CIA
                    Station Chief changed and we lost an extremely good, extremely competent station
                    chief, and he was replaced by Joe Fernandez who was subsequently to become
                    famous.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was part of the Iran contra business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I don't know to this day whether before he arrived if he was already part
                    of the North/Casey inner circle or if he was gradually brought into it during
                    the course of his time in Costa Rica. There is no question that he eventually
                    got there, he and North are now partners in this company that sells bulletproof
                    vests and other security equipment. It quickly became clear that there was a lot
                    that Fernandez was up to that the rest of the Embassy had no idea about. As time
                    went on Winsor was—I don't know what Gorman said to Winsor but I'm sure he said
                    something, and Winsor began to lose confidence in me. Somehow I was opposed to
                    all of these good things that he was trying to do and he was getting
                    increasingly frustrated about what was going on in Washington, he was
                    increasingly restive at the leash that he was personally being held on, and the
                    lack of progress in Central American policy generally. He said as much, that he
                    expected that there was going to be a military intervention in Nicaragua during
                    his tour. In fact, he really hoped that it would not be just Nicaragua but that
                    it would be Cuba as well, because he used to go around quoting Alexander Haig
                    saying, “We've go to go to the source.” Everybody knew what the source was.
                    Curiously they chose to forget about Moscow, but Cuba was a lot more “do-able”
                    or they thought it was anyway.</p>
                <p>One of the things that really damaged his and my relationship was that in about
                    April 1984, he gave a speech and he was very nervous about public appearances,
                    he didn't do this kind of thing easily, fortunately he didn't give a lot of
                    speeches. There was some forum that invited him to make a speech and both local
                    and foreign press were there. He wrote the speech but didn't show it to anybody
                    in the Embassy or to Washington, which Ambassadors are required to do. I saw it
                    for the first time in the car on the way to the place where he was going to give
                    the speech. He handed it to me to read and I was just appalled. It would have
                    been bad enough if he had talked about just Costa Rica, but he talked about all
                    of Central America, which of course he had no responsibility for. He even
                    brought in Cuba, he had very strong language about Cuba. So he gave the speech
                    and then promptly went out of town and when he got back he found out that I had
                    had USIS type up the transcript of his speech and send it in to Washington as a
                    telegram, and he was clearly startled but he didn't say anything further. He
                    went home and talked to his wife and his wife was very protective of him. I
                    think she told him he needed to read me the riot act, because when he came back
                    the next day he was really upset about my having sent out this speech without
                    his having had a chance to revise it. I said “Mr. Ambassador, the press was
                    there, they reported on the version that you gave and Washington needs to know
                    what in fact you actually said.” He came very close at that point for asking for
                    my removal primarily on the basis of this speech. Finally he decided not to [get
                    rid of me], which I'm sure he came later to regret. [laughter] It was an
                    extraordinary time. There was all of this stuff going on with regard to
                    Nicaragua.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Eden Pastora was one of the exiles in Costa Rica, the leader of one faction of
                    the Contras, and there was an assassination attempt against him, a bomb that
                    went off just a couple of blocks from the embassy. Then there was another
                    assassination attempt, in May 1984, which took place at a Pastora press
                    conference, just across the border in Nicaragua at a place called La Penca,
                    which didn't get Pastora but did kill eight other people. One of them was an
                    American who was working for a little English language newspaper in Costa Rica
                    called the Tico Times. The Tico Times together with a couple of other American
                    journalists concluded that the CIA had done this, that the American government
                    knew more than it was admitting. They started a long, long, campaign to expose
                    what was being hidden, what was really behind all of this. The Embassy (I was
                    charg� at that point) found out at some point in the night that some kind of
                    incident had occurred in southern Nicaragua and that there were potentially
                    Americans involved. It was not until the next morning that we were able to get
                    somebody up into the area — the Costa Rican side of the border, we of course
                    could not cross into Nicaragua — to find out what had happened and to confirm
                    that there were Americans at the press conference. I think by that time this one
                    American was dead, she had initially survived the blast, but had died of loss of
                    blood before—they were miles and miles away from any kind of medical attention.
                    The injured, a dozen or more, had to be put into a little motor boat and brought
                    back across the river into Costa Rica. We had considerable turbulence going on
                    outside of the embassy and considerable turbulence going on inside it as well.
                    [laughter] The probable perpetrator was identified pretty quickly, a man using a
                    false Danish passport who disappeared immediately afterwards. The issue was who
                    was he working for. To us, it was obvious that those who most wanted to get rid
                    of Pastora were the Sandinistas, and about ten years later that was confirmed.
                    But for a long time there were journalists who argued it was the CIA. One of the
                    allegations that the Tico Times found most persuasive was that I had not made
                    any requests for helicopters to come flying up from the Southern Command in
                    Panama to rescue these Americans who possibly, but not for certain, were in this
                    really remote place out in the jungle, in another country, at night.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the problems almost always of the Deputy Chief of
                        Mission, particularly when you have a political appointee as Ambassador, but
                        even in other cases—if you have an Ambassador who is straying off of the
                        reservation, you might say, there is a conflict. You've got American
                        interests and then you have the integrity of your relationship to the
                        Ambassador. Was this being strained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, it was being strained. At one point I met with Tony Motley (who
                    replaced Enders as Assistant Secretary) shortly after Motley had come into the
                    job and he said that when he was Ambassador in Brazil the thing that he most
                    prized in his DCM's was a loyalty. His second DCM was certainly loyal to him,
                    because he resigned from the foreign service when Motley left government and
                    joined Motley in his private consulting firm. [laughter] But Motley also said
                    that if there was ever anything that should come up that he should know about,
                    all I had to do was pick up the phone. [laughter] Q: Oh boy, talk about a double
                    set of instructions.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>JONES: Wow! I never took him up on that, I never tried to call Motley directly.
                    What I was torn by was the feeling that I had an obligation to the Department of
                    State as an institution, to keep it informed, to tell it what it should know
                    about what was going on in Costa Rica. I was once talking to Winsor on some
                    subject and I referred to “our masters in Washington,” a phase I chose
                    deliberately just to see how he would react, and he looked at me with the most
                    puzzled expression on his face. I think that part of his problem was that he
                    thought that he worked exclusively for Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some political Ambassadors take this very much to heart.
                        It just ain't the way the system works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. He was very close to Constantine Menges who was Reagan's National
                    Security Advisor for Latin America and who interestingly in the end felt
                    betrayed by Oliver North as well, because so much was going on that North wasn't
                    telling Menges. [laughter] Every telegram of importance he [Winsor] used to
                    slug, “NSC for Menges.” I remember being told by the Director of Central
                    American Affairs, “For God's sake, can't you get the Ambassador to stop slugging
                    telegrams for Menges? If he wants to send to them to the NSC as an institution
                    that's fine. But to slug them personally for the guy who is the single greatest
                    thorn in ARA's side, whom ARA calls the 'constant menace,' does not do the
                    Ambassador any good with the Department.” The Ambassador could have cared less
                    whether it did him any good to the Department. [laughter] His relations not only
                    got to be bad with me, they got progressively worse with the Department as an
                    institution, and with Motley as Assistant Secretary. Because there were a series
                    of occasions when Motley called him on the carpet, both on the phone and when
                    Winsor went to Washington. He finally told him “No more press conferences.”
                    Winsor went right ahead and gave a press conference and Motley called me one day
                    and said “Where is the Ambassador?” and I said “He's at the residence giving a
                    press conference,” and he said “God Dammit, I told him not to ever give another
                    press conference. Transfer this call to the residence.” [laughter] So I did and
                    he interrupted him in the middle of the press conference and reamed him out and
                    Winsor went back into the room and gave the rest of the press conference. It was
                    not a pleasant 19 months being DCM to Curt Winsor. I think that if he had been
                    somebody I could detest it would have made it easier, but as I said at the
                    beginning, he was a very likable guy and he had fine children, and you couldn't
                    help feeling sorry for the guy who was just in so far over his head in this
                    major arena for American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about the Gorman visit, were there any other
                        major things that happened which reflect how we dealt with things in Costa

                </p>
                <p>JONES: We talked about the abortive effort to get rid of the Minister of Interior
                    which went on for weeks., and Gorman's efforts to get American military forces
                    into the area near the northern frontier.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, they never came. Gorman said over and over again (as if this were the
                    convincing point) that he could not send American troops into this dangerous
                    area without being able to protect them. And it was his responsibility as
                    Commander-in-Chief to have them protected and he seemed to think that was the
                    end of the argument and the fact the Costa Ricans viewed it differently didn't
                    seem to have any relevance or importance to him. It was an impasse that never
                    got resolved.And the Pastora assassination attempt, those were the three most
                    dramatic things that happened during this period.</p>
                <p>Another one toward the end of Winsor's period was the effort to put up a Voice of
                    America transmitter, not right up into the border area but close enough to
                    Nicaragua—the objective was so that it could be heard clearly in Nicaragua on a
                    medium wave, to supplement the Voice of America's short wave broadcasting, to
                    broadcast on regular AM frequencies so that anybody with any kind of radio in
                    Nicaragua could hear the VOA. That was in fact built, the Costa Ricans agreed to
                    having it built. Part of the reason was that we didn't propose to protect with
                    anything other than civilian security guards. That led to another long Winsor
                    battle with Washington because he said that the site could be easily overrun. I
                    suppose it was not impossible that there could have been a Sandinista commando
                    unit infiltrated into Costa Rica, that they certainly could have done. At a
                    minimum he wanted to issue the guards AK-47's or the equivalent, and Washington
                    wouldn't hear of it. He had a hard time understanding this, but I think the
                    Washington strategy was that they would have been very happy if the Sandinista's
                    had actually attacked this tower out in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of
                    a Costa Rican cow pasture. Because it would have given them another excuse to do
                    something against Nicaragua, so they didn't care how well it was protected.
                    Those I think were the major issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, and it's been seven or eight years since I've
                        done my interview with him, he was quite proud of helping Costa Rica get
                        away from government projects into private projects. Does that make any
                        sense or not? Moving Costa Rica more into the private sector, away from the
                        sort of socialist type of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was nothing dramatic or major in that area, because there wasn't a
                    huge amount of the Costa Rican economy that was in the state sector to begin
                    with. Some of the AID money did go into strengthening the private sector, which
                    was certainly a good thing. This institute for the training of businessmen for
                    example that I mentioned, was one of AID's creations. I don't think that there
                    was any major change, I suspect that whatever the percentage is that's in the
                    state sector in Costa Rica is probably pretty much the same today as it was in
                    1983.</p>

                        February 1985. How long did you stay on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I stayed as charg� until July, I left the day after the 4th of July party
                    in 1985. Jim Tull replaced me as DCM and as charg�, he arrived on July 4 and
                    took over the next day. The new Ambassador was Lou Tambs, another political
                    appointee who had been Ambassador in Colombia and Jim Tull had been his DCM, so
                    he brought him with him to Costa Rica. During those five months the main thing
                    that I tried to do, was to pull the embassy back together. The removal of the
                    Ambassador and all of the bitterness and tension that surrounded it was
                    obviously very corrosive to the morale and efficiency of the embassy. So what my
                    wife and I tried to do for the next five months was just to get everybody calmed
                    down and working together as a team again, and to take all of this tension and
                    antagonism out of the air. He tried to get rid of a lot of people, he did get
                    rid of the Economic Counselor, he tried very hard to get rid of the public
                    affairs officer and it was not an easy time for a lot of people, not just for
                    me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: I went to Santiago, Chile as DCM. As it turned out, I was charg� there
                    until November. I spent most of 1985 as charg� at one embassy or another.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 29, 1996. George, with “DCM-ships”
                        usually the Ambassador has to pass on you—was there any of that? How did you
                        get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Actually around the end of 1984, I got a phone call from someone in
                    personnel asking me if I would be the Department's candidate for Ambassador to
                    Belize. I thought it over and turned it down, and subsequently, I'm very glad
                    that I did. One of the problems was that this was the Reagan administration and
                    the Reagan administration had this system of having the Department put up a
                    foreign service officer candidate for every Ambassadorship and then there would
                    be what I would call a battle, I suppose the White House would have called it an
                    evaluation of merits, between the FSO and the political appointee whom the White
                    House had tapped for that particular post. Surprise, surprise, the FSO usually
                    lost, and I knew lots of cases where people sat around waiting for months doing
                    nothing, while the decision was fought out as to whether they or the political
                    appointee were going to go. I didn't know it at the time, but some instinct had
                    warned me, that the guy that the White House had tapped for this post was an
                    assistant secretary named Jim Malone, he was the assistant secretary for oceans,
                    environment and science.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember running across him one time. He had a
                        reputation of being a terrible administrator, he couldn't make up his
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I never met him or had anything to do with him directly, but he was eased
                    out of that position by George Shultz. Some compensation had to be given and the
                    best that Shultz would permit was for him to go to Belize. He turned out to have
                    a major confirmation problem, and it took over a year before he finally withdrew
                    his candidacy. I could have been sitting there that whole year as the candidate
                    in waiting. [laughter] So I'm very glad I turned that down, and I knew having
                    turned down an offer of an Ambassadorship, I wasn't going to be offered another.
                    So what I could hope for was a good DCM job, fortunately my name was put forward
                    to Harry Barnes who had been handpicked by George Shultz to go as Ambassador to
                    Chile. Harry had been our Ambassador in India, to go from being Ambassador from
                    India to Chile could be viewed in some quarters as a “come down”, but Shultz was
                    quoted as saying that “Harry had done an incredible job in turning around our
                    relations with India” and he [Shultz] was very concerned with the lack of
                    progress toward democracy in Chile and he wanted a first-rate, very strong U.S.
                    Ambassador to go there. I had never met Barnes, but fortunately there was an ARA
                    Chief of Missions conference at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida in March of
                    1985, and as charg� in Costa Rica I was asked to come. Harry went as
                    Ambassador-designate to Chile and he interviewed me while we were there for this
                    conference. Subsequently, he called me from India, it was probably my first
                    tip-off to Harry's incredible energy and activity level, that he called me in
                    Costa Rica sometime later and asked me what time it was there and then he told
                    me it was 1:00 in the morning in India, and I was astonished that he would be
                    conducting business at 1:00 in the morning. I subsequently learned not to be
                    astonished, Harry conducted business every waking moment. [laughter] He offered
                    me the job and I was delighted, I liked what I had seen and heard of him, and
                    although I had never been there, I knew Chile was a beautiful country and the
                    political situation was challenging. So off we went. I had about a month's leave
                    and got to Chile in August 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Chile from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>JONES: From August 1985 until May 1989. I had hoped to have a little longer
                    leave, but Wade Matthews, whom I replaced, sent me a telegram and pointed out
                    that if I arrived after August 11, he would have to do new efficiency reports on
                    everyone. Because you have to do new ones if it has been 120 days from the end
                    of the last rating period, that was almost the only argument that he could have
                    used that would have persuaded me, since I hated to do them myself and would not
                    have wanted to have to do unnecessary ones. I said okay, I would be there August
                    10. I also didn't anticipate that I was going to be charg� for very long, but
                    one of the famous things about Harry is that he is a linguist, I've forgotten
                    how many languages he spoke, it was six or seven or eight. He used to send
                    telegrams in other languages off to people in the service that he knew, and the
                    communications room would have to cope with them. [laughter] Just to keep his
                    hand in. One of the languages that he didn't have was Spanish and he wanted to
                    be fluent in Spanish before he came, so he took a substantial course of Spanish.
                    He was also engaged in seeing everybody that he could in Washington, including
                    everybody that he could on the Hill to make sure that his support was firm, that
                    he understood what the objectives of U.S. policy were and what parameters he
                    could operate in. As a result of all of this, he didn't get to Chile until
                    November 1985. So I had three months as charg� and it was—any time in those
                    years would have been a tense, exciting, challenging time. Because the
                    democratic forces in Chile were increasingly frustrated and despondent about
                    ever forcing Pinochet out.</p>
                <p>Just after I arrived they concluded what was called the National Accord, which
                    was an agreement among all of the political spectrum, except for the far right
                    and the far left, which had been reached under the aegis of the Cardinal and
                    spelled out the kind of moderate political program that they would follow if
                    they were in power. The idea was to provide some reassurance and some
                    counterweight to the assertions of Pinochet and his supporters that if the
                    civilians were ever allowed back into power they would be a bunch of wild-eyed
                    radicals who would lead the country right down the course of Allende and ruin
                    the country again. So this was a very significant development because the
                    parties in any country often are—they had done a lot of quarreling among
                    themselves and it was very difficult for them to get together. There was a lot
                    of disagreement about what the right strategy was for dealing with Pinochet and
                    so on. It was very difficult for them to get together and it was a considerable
                    achievement, that they had finally agreed on this document and they had signed
                    it very formally in the presence of Cardinal Fresno.</p>

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>JONES: That was later, that was a major issue later on, but at this point the
                    civilians seemed so far from power and Pinochet so secure that wasn't even an
                    issue. Although there was intense interest generated by this document and the
                    Embassy did a lot of reporting on it, it swiftly became clear that Pinochet had
                    no intention of paying any attention to it. He had a famous meeting when the
                    Cardinal went to see him, just before Christmas...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Cardinal of Santiago, as opposed to the papal
                        nuncio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The Archbishop of Santiago who happened also to wear a Cardinal's hat,
                    Juan Fresno, one of many, many Chileans for whom I hold great admiration, but
                    certainly the only Cardinal that I ever spent any amount of time with. He was
                    not a very political Cardinal, his predecessor, Cardinal Silva, who was still
                    alive but had retired from active church duties, was a much more aggressively
                    political priest. That was not Fresno's nature at all, I don't think he liked
                    the limelight, he didn't like controversy all that much. But he felt
                    increasingly that it was his obligation to try to bring about reconciliation in
                    Chile and it was clear to him as to almost everybody outside of the military
                    that the only way you could have a reconciliation was if you restored democracy.
                    You could not have reconciliation in the context of a military dictatorship. So
                    Harry and I had a lot of meetings with him to talk about how things were going
                    and what the right strategy was and so on. When Fresno saw that Pinochet wasn't
                    responding in any way to the national accord, he paid a courtesy call just
                    before Christmas and Pinochet let it be known that Fresno had asked him about he
                    National Accord and he responded by saying “We have turned the page.” Meaning
                    that was a closed book and he had no intention of doing anything about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Chile was another - like dealing with Curtin Winsor, like being a desk officer -
                    of those exposures of mine to the fact that the Department of State never tells
                    you what to do. [laughter] In some senses I've experienced this through my whole
                    career, I mean from the very first day that you come on board you're given a
                    desk and paper is thrust at you and you're kind of expected to figure out what
                    to do with it. Officially we call it on-the- job training. [laughter] In my
                    case, I came on before FSI had practically anything in the way of training
                    programs. But even today, the amount of training in what you're expected to do,
                    I think is incredibly minimal in the Foreign Service of the United States. In
                    1985, here I was being sent off to be charg� in Chile, Ambassador Theberge had
                    left a few days before I got there, Matthews was charg� and I was replacing him
                    as charg�. The Department knew that for some unspecified period of time I was
                    going to be charg�, conducting our relations with Chile, you would have thought
                    that somebody would have said something to me about what their expectations
                    were, what our policy line was. [laughter] I did have a meeting with Elliot
                    Abrams who was just coming in as Assistant Secretary and got the sort of feeling
                    from the conversation and what I knew about his record in his previous job as
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, that he was sympathetic to the return of
                    democracy to Chile. But no instructions as to how to go about it, nothing about
                    how far we were prepared to go and specifically, how hard we should press
                    Pinochet. What was at stake here was if you—normally in any country, you seek to
                    keep a good relationship with the government to which you are accredited, but
                    you are at the same time, pressing them to do any number of things that the U.S.
                    government wants them to do. Keeping these two things in balance is not normally
                    a difficult problem, but if what you are pressing them to do is to leave power,
                    keeping good relations and a smooth working relationship becomes a little more
                    difficult. There was an obvious neat calculation to be made here, which as far
                    as I could tell, the Ambassador and I were to make on our own. Now maybe Harry
                    got more precise guidance from the higher levels that he had access to than I
                    did. I decided that my first job was to get to know everybody, which turned out
                    in Chile, to be a statement in itself. Because if you met with the opposition
                    and you got to know the opposition, that was immediately a subject of criticism
                    by the government, you were wasting time with these unsavory characters who
                    didn't have the sense to respect what General Pinochet had done for Chile. I
                    didn't try to distinguish across the political spectrum, as to who I met with,
                    and I found that everybody was curious to see the new man at the U.S.
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>You know, I think if the Ambassador had shown up in two weeks, nobody would have
                    paid any attention to me. But as weeks stretched into months and I was the only
                    game in town, there was a proliferation of interest in trying to figure out what
                    was going on at the US embassy and with US policy and so forth.</p>

                        she left? Anyway her aura was still around in which she said sort of they're
                        good dictators and we shouldn't insult them or something like that. Pinochet

                    for fear of offending our friends in the Chilean government. And you had lots of
                    other cases. Ambassador Theberge had a record of being very cozy with Pinochet's
                    government. At the very end, one of his last official acts, he gave a speech, I
                    think it was on Lincoln's birthday or maybe it was dedicating a bust of Lincoln.
                    He used the occasion to make quite a good speech that made the case for
                    democracy, but it was about the only occasion on which he was outspoken. I guess
                    he, like others in the Reagan administration, was growing frustrated with the
                    lack of progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Theberge's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He was an academic as I recall. I don't recall from where.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he been making contacts around the political
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He had some contact with the opposition, but it was... He was pursuing the
                    first Reagan administration ('81-'85) policy of you achieve what you want with
                    these dictators by not offending them. You don't gratuitously offend them; you
                    seek to have good relations with them, and that makes you more acceptable and
                    therefore more persuasive in moderating their conduct. Well... I suspect my tone
                    suggests what I think of that. It certainly didn't work in Chile. It got
                    absolutely nowhere. Pinochet I don't think was ever moved by roses or thorns,
                    neither by promises nor threats. He was one tough cookie and we will talk in a
                    moment about what in fact led to his downfall, but it was not the tone of
                    American pressures on him. My friend Tony Motley paid a visit in the spring of
                    '85 just before he was pushed out as Assistant Secretary, and made a famous
                    statement. The problem was that Pinochet controlled the press. He controlled by
                    controlling the licensing and newsprint, he controlled which papers existed.
                    Those papers that existed were kept on a tight leash, and it worked because most
                    of them were in debt and could be threatened with sudden foreclosure. The famous
                    Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, for example, had gotten badly into debt. You
                    sometimes read about Pinochet's economic miracle. I always bristle whenever I
                    read that because in fact there was a Pinochet crash in the early 1980's when
                    most of the Latin American economies were getting into trouble. He did bring in
                    good economic advisors after that and subsequently began to turn the economy
                    around.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the so-called Chicago boys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The Chicago Boys were actually the ones who got him into trouble. The
                    Chicago boys were doing a number of good things—so called because they were all
                    graduates of the University of Chicago—but their great mistake was that they
                    insisted on a fixed absolutely immovable exchange rate. The theory being that it
                    would squeeze the inflation out of the Chilean economy. They had, like many
                    right wing economists, an absolute obsession with avoiding inflation. This was
                    particularly understandable in Chile because one of the huge causes of
                    dissatisfaction with Allende was the incredible inflation that his policies had
                    brought about. They got rid of most of the inflation, but they wanted to get rid
                    of more, and they thought the way to do that was to maintain a fixed exchange
                    rate. A lot of people borrowed in dollars on the government's assurance that the
                    rate was never going to change, and when the day came that it became impossible
                    to maintain a fixed rate, devaluation occurred, and people found themselves
                    owing several times what they had originally borrowed in terms of Chilean pesos.
                    This was among the reasons why the newspapers were either controlled or subject
                    to pressure by the government. So the government could take a phrase out of
                    something someone said and hang them with it. Tony Motley was hung by a phrase,
                    one thing he said in the context of a several day visit, many statements and
                    press conferences and so on. I can't remember now the question he was asked, but
                    part of his answer was that Chile was in good hands. What he was trying to say
                    was that the Chilean people could determine the future of Chile; the future of
                    Chile was in their hands. But that simple phrase, was interpreted to mean that
                    Chile was in Pinochet's hands and those were the good hands. There was a lot of
                    reason for the right wing in Chile and for Pinochet to believe that the Reagan
                    administration was their friend and if not totally on its side could be
                    manipulated not to give it any serious trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>But the desire to check out the new faces in the embassy even got to the point
                    where the first daughter invited me over. Pinochet's adult daughter, in her '30s
                    I guess, considered to be very politically powerful. He had a son who was of not
                    much account. His wife supposedly didn't care very much about politics and was
                    not very much involved with it. But his daughter was supposed to be his closest
                    advisor, and in fact went with him to a lot of functions and was seen with him
                    constantly. A call came from one of her aides asking me to come over and discuss
                    some cultural foundation that she was involved with. Since it was supposedly
                    cultural and it was a family thing, I took my wife with me. We went to call on
                    her and of course what it was really about was on behalf of Pinochet whom at
                    that point I had never seen; it was to find out more about me and what kind of
                    an animal I was, also to quiz me about the Ambassador. I remember in particular
                    she asked me why had the United States decided to send an ambassador who had no
                    previous experience in Latin America and didn't even speak Spanish. So I
                    explained to her who Harry Barnes was and what his career record had been and
                    what his fame as a linguist was and by the time he got to Chile, he would be
                    speaking Spanish. It was a fascinating encounter. It was the first and only time
                    I ever had a meeting with the daughter, and it was my first exposure to the
                    Pinochet family and to the incredible arrogance of the Chilean right. It wasn't
                    just the Pinochet family. A lot of the Chileans I met were among the finest
                    people I've met anywhere, but the right wing in Chile is something else. It is
                    further right and more absolutely confident of its divine right to rule the
                    country than anywhere else I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this just military or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh no! The military in Chile, like the military everywhere else, was the
                    hardest possible target for the embassy. The military is important in Latin
                    America; it always has been. Its importance is now somewhat diminished, but in
                    all the countries I served in, the military was always important, except in
                    Costa Rica which doesn't have one. You would always want to know more about what
                    the military was thinking, what their views were, what their intentions were,
                    and you had very little information from any source to go on. The military
                    simply would not discuss politics with foreigners. Particularly in Chile, you
                    could do some skirmishing with them. Sometimes on rare occasions you could get a
                    military officer to engage in a little debate with you, but you couldn't tell
                    whether they were making the officially designated debating points or were they
                    saying what they really believed, so you didn't come away any wiser after
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our attach�s didn't have a good in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>JONES: No. Our military attach� system doesn't really function, at least in Latin
                    America, at all. I can't speak for the rest of the world. Where we had very good
                    people, they were usually in the MilGroup system, the US Military Group, the
                    technical advisors. John Taylor, who was head of what we called the Office of
                    Defense Cooperation in Costa Rica and George Carpenter who was head of our
                    military group in Chile were first class people and far more aware politically
                    and plugged in to what the military was thinking than the attach�s were. (In
                    fairness Carpenter later became Army attach� in Argentina.) One of the
                    absurdities that every foreign service officer has to deal with is that the
                    Department of Defense, the Defense Intelligence Agency, has divided up the world
                    among the three services so that every service has an equal share, no service is
                    favored more than another. The absurdity in Chile was that Chile was assigned to
                    the US Navy. Now in Chile as in every other country in Latin America, the
                    overwhelmingly important military service was the army. The one you most wanted
                    to know about was what the army was going to do. The army was always the largest
                    service, had the most troops, the most physical as well as political clout. But
                    the DOD system was absolutely impossible to change. I'm sure that many
                    ambassadors have thrust their lances at that windmill and lost. But Harry, as
                    usual, faced with a rigid system, knew how to work within it. He brought in a
                    navy captain who had served under him in India, a very good man named Peterson.
                    These people I've named did the best they possibly could to get some information
                    and did get some useful things just not very much because the military was so
                    damned impenetrable.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>There always has been in Chile a very strong right. There was a conservative
                    party in the 19th century which was very strong and they regularly elected
                    presidents and had a significant share of the vote of the Chilean electorate.
                    Even the moderate conservatives in Chile felt the country owed the military a
                    debt for having saved them from Allende, that the worst possible thing to happen
                    to Chile, far worse than Pinochet, would be a return to someone like Allende and
                    though the more moderate ones among them would like to see more movement toward
                    democracy, they were terribly concerned that it not go so fast as to be
                    destabilizing, that it proceed in a carefully controlled manner so as to
                    minimize the chance of the wrong people getting control of Chile once again. The
                    Allende experience was an absolutely searing one for everybody outside of the
                    extreme left. Of course what followed Allende was absolutely searing for the
                    extreme left, so everybody in Chile was still wearing the scars. But the less
                    moderate members of the right were pro-Pinochet and proud of it and were
                    extraordinarily contemptuous of anyone who didn't share their point of view. I
                    got to know that well sort of by default and sort of by—I'm trying to decide
                    whether to say by direction of the Ambassador would be accurate or not. Harry
                    certainly knew everything I did, and I think he felt I was doing the right
                    thing. I sort of became the embassy's emissary to the right, a role I was not
                    always comfortable in. In the process of seeing everybody in those first months
                    I had gotten to know people on the right as well as most other sectors. Once the
                    Ambassador was there the leaders of the opposition gravitated toward the
                    Ambassador as they should. The political section was also heavily involved in
                    keeping up with what the opposition was doing. The niche that was left for me to
                    fit into was to try to maintain a channel open to the right and explain to them
                    what we were doing and why we were doing it and why we felt it was important to
                    do it and not cause them to feel totally cut off. They came to be very bitter
                    toward the Ambassador, bitter toward the United States. It was a very difficult
                    relationship, but I think an embassy has to have its antennae out to all sectors
                    in society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Well now these initial months when you were there,
                        when you were the Charg�, I'm sure people were approaching you from all
                        sectors saying Se�or Jones, please tell me where does the United States
                        stand on things and here you are with no instructions. And always the
                        problem is if you come with an ambassador whom you don't really know at all,
                        you don't want to set any course that he might have to disavow or set it
                        right. Also this is not a benign country, this is not a place where we
                        haven't been seared by the whole Allende thing too, in the American
                        political spectrum. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: What we said publicly was of course carefully coordinated with Washington.
                    What we said on the National Accord was in fact said in Washington, drafted by
                    the Office of Southern Cone Affairs and issued by the Department spokesman, and
                    we simply publicized it in Chile. We didn't say anything on our own
                    publicly.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>What we said privately—it is a little hard to separate in my mind now what we
                    might have said at various stages because I suspect that some evolution took
                    place over time. When asked what we desired for Chile the answer was always we
                    would like to see Chile return to democracy. You would usually then be asked,
                    “How do you define democracy? Are you going to insist that it be American-style
                    democracy on American terms or are you going to let us design our own Chilean
                    democracy?” So we would debate for five minutes or five hours how you define
                    democracy and how you can tell when you have a democracy and when you don't.
                    Something had occurred in Chile prior to our getting there which at the time did
                    not seem terribly significant and I'm sure the embassy didn't know the full
                    story at the time either. It only came out later. But in the late 70's, Pinochet
                    had come under a lot of pressure to have a constitution. He'd been operating
                    without a constitution. There was a military junta which issued decrees. The
                    pressure was coming from that same right wing that although perfectly happy with
                    Pinochet and what he had done, wanted more of the traditional trappings of the
                    Chilean republic and wanted to be able to say they were a constitutional
                    republic. They didn't like having Chile referred to all around the world as a
                    military dictatorship. So he finally agreed and a group of his most trusted
                    civilian advisors were selected to draft a constitution. His instruction to them
                    for the first draft or whatever was that on adoption of the constitution,
                    Pinochet would become the constitutional president of the republic for a term of
                    16 years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: His term would just be coming to an end this year. As this got discussed
                    among his advisors, they got increasingly nervous and finally got up the courage
                    to say to him that they were concerned that this would be a public relations
                    disaster and therefore wouldn't achieve the whole purpose of having a
                    constitution, which was to improve Chile's image, and that it might even
                    endanger approval of the constitution which was going to be via a plebiscite. So
                    they argued with him and finally got him to agree to divide it in half and he
                    would have an eight-year term. At the end of eight years, in October 1988, there
                    would be another plebiscite which would vote yes or no on the question, “Do you
                    wish President Pinochet to continue for a second eight year term until 1996?”
                    That's what was written in the constitution that was adopted in 1980.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>When I arrived in Chile, and even before in 1984, the opposition focus was on
                    trying to force some immediate change in the circumstances of how Chile was
                    governed, force him to restore a Congress or permit elections or move in some
                    way toward greater democracy in Chile. As time went on, it became evident to
                    everybody that nothing was going to convince him to do this. The opposition had
                    tried demonstrations; they had tried every kind of rally and strike, all the
                    statements coming from the U.S. Government, nothing was having any effect. The
                    opposition became extremely demoralized by the rejection of the National Accord.
                    After that the spirits of the opposition went into a long decline because there
                    just seemed no hope of anything. As October 1988 came closer, it became evident
                    that there was a potential for forcing Pinochet to do something. There was one
                    lever that he, himself, had given everybody, which was to defeat him in the
                    plebiscite. When we pointed that out to the opposition, many of the opposition
                    leaders said, “You've gotta be kidding. You think Pinochet is going to let us
                    win the plebiscite? You don't know this man. We've lived with him all these
                    years. He had outmaneuvered, manipulated, tricked the United States Government,
                    every United States Ambassador, all of us, the Cardinal. Look how he embarrassed
                    the Cardinal. The Cardinal went to see him and he brushed him off. There is
                    absolutely no way. What you're suggesting is ridiculous. We will boycott the
                    plebiscite. It is a sham and a hoax.”</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>But what our policy became in Chile, in 1986-88, was to encourage the opposition
                    to participate in the plebiscite and to make every effort they could possibly
                    make to win it. We devoted some resources to helping them win it, both through
                    direct grants from AID and grants coming from the National Endowment for
                    Democracy to the National Democratic Institute. We provided funding for a number
                    of different efforts related to participation in the plebiscite. As time grew
                    near for the plebiscite, some of the opposition leaders decided to give it a
                    try: two political leaders in particular who were crucial. The Christian
                    Democrats, who had always been the largest single party in Chile, had an
                    internal election in July 1987, and Gabriel Valdes who had been the leader of
                    the Christian Democrats was replaced by Patricio Aylwin. Valdes had leaned
                    toward those who thought Pinochet was invincible. Aylwin was prepared to do
                    battle. The other key player was Ricardo Lagos who was a US-educated Socialist.
                    One of the things we had trouble with in the embassy was reestablishing
                    relations with the Socialists. The Socialist Party in Allende's time was closely
                    allied with the Communists. There were various factions of the Socialist Party
                    who in the US Government view were still, in 1987, hand in glove with the
                    Communist Party. There were great qualms about dealing with the Socialists. But
                    we established good relations certainly with all the Socialists who were in
                    Chile. The more extreme ones were in exile in any event. In fact the Socialists
                    had their own internal problems in deciding how to proceed, to the point that it
                    proved impossible to get a unified socialist party because of its many
                    splinters, let alone get any agreement on a joint course of action. Lagos then
                    went out and formed his own new party called the Party for Democracy, the PPD.
                    Great choice of name. To do it he had to go through a very complicated and
                    tedious process collecting signatures to get the party legalized. Everybody,
                    both Socialists and other opposition leaders, said it can't possibly be done.
                    Pinochet will execute anybody who signs your petition. Even if people sign the
                    petition he'll find some technicality; he won't recognize it. Lagos went out,
                    did it, got all the signatures, met all the legal requirements, and lo and
                    behold they were recognized.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting questions is to what extent did the United States help?
                    There is a very large extent to which these things would have happened anyway
                    with or without our presence. We certainly provided some moral support and
                    encouragement at their very darkest moment when they were most discouraged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me George. You say we. There must have been some talk
                        up in Washington with the new Ambassador coming in and all about what do you
                        do about this, I realize the Ambassador wasn't that new at this point, but
                        how was the decision reached of saying let's go for it or was there no other
                        choice at hand in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>JONES: There seemed to be a, if there was a formal decision process, I don't know
                    what it was but somehow there was a coming together of minds. Mike Durkee was
                    director of the Office of Southern Cone Affairs during the first part of our
                    time in Chile and he was an absolute tower of strength. Elliott Abrams in the
                    public statements that he was making about Chile was much more clearly
                    pro-democracy, and more willing to go on the record about it, than any of his
                    predecessors had been. So I may have been uncertain at the beginning about how
                    much support the Embassy had in Washington, but as time went on, statement after
                    statement from the Assistant Secretary left no doubt about where we stood. We
                    even got some statements by Reagan. Every so often he would say something,
                    something would be put in front of him that he would agree to, that we could
                    quote about the importance of democracy. As I recall he made one or two specific
                    Chile- related statements. There were some staff members at the White House who
                    were pushing advocacy of democracy as an element of Reagan administration
                    foreign policy, among other things because of its utility in Central America. It
                    made our Central American policy much more defensible if we could say we were
                    for democracy everywhere whether it was right wing or left wing governments we
                    were talking about. So there was a great consensus of minds. I mean you can view
                    it as a sudden shift in American policy, but I think it is more realistic to
                    view it as an evolution of policy over time. I think Tony Motley returned from
                    that 1985 trip feeling very frustrated at his inability to get through to
                    Pinochet and his advisers. It was his last try at private reasoning with the
                    Pinochet government, and all he got for his pains was the exploitation of that
                    out-of-context quote. I think even had Motley stayed on as Assistant Secretary
                    there would have been a continued movement in the same direction. Abrams did it
                    a little faster, maybe a little more publicly than Motley would have done, but I
                    think that everybody except for the extreme right wingers in the administration,
                    and there were fewer of them in the second Reagan administration than in the
                    first, was feeling that the time had come, we had waited long enough in Chile.
                    We had waited since 1973 for the military to give up what everybody had viewed
                    as a temporary interruption in civilian government in Chile. The temporary
                    interruption had now gone on for 15 years and it was high time that something
                    was done about it.</p>

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>JONES: His view was that you had to, the American Ambassador had to demonstrate
                    publicly where our sympathies lay. He didn't do this by public statements. He
                    didn't talk much to the press; he held very few press conferences. He talked to
                    the American press, but he didn't do much talking in Chile. He left that to me.
                    I did a lot more of that than he did. By doing it publicly, I mean by his public
                    actions. He went to call on Gabriel Valdes, the leader of the Christian
                    Democrats, shortly after he had arrived. He had of course presented his
                    credentials to Pinochet and met with the Foreign Minister and other major
                    government officials. The Valdes visit greatly irritated the government. We
                    hadn't realized that it was going to irritate the government so greatly that he
                    would do this before he had called on every single one of the ministers in the
                    government. We were showing lack of respect for the people in power. Not long
                    after, there was a human rights ceremony. I think it was on Human Rights Day,
                    December 10. There was a ceremony in the cathedral. The Church had established a
                    body called the Vicariate of Solidarity, which meant solidarity with those who
                    were imprisoned and exiled and oppressed, and the Vicariate had organized the
                    ceremony. There was a procession leaving the church, people left the church
                    carrying candles. Harry went and left the church carrying a candle. Outrage!
                    Fury! Incomprehension! that the American Ambassador would associate himself with
                    these communists in the Catholic Church.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>There were a series of things like that. Occasions when we visited people in
                    prison, usually people who had some connection with the United States in one way
                    or another. Neither the Ambassador nor I went, but we sent an Embassy officer to
                    visit them, and this was noticed and reported. Of course the most notorious
                    thing he did which brought him — grief is too strong a word, but it certainly
                    brought him enormous controversy, was in July of '86. There were some
                    demonstrations in the streets of Santiago. Two Chilean teenagers, a boy and a
                    girl, were intercepted by a Chilean army patrol. The patrol obviously suspected
                    them of participating in the demonstrations. The girl may in fact have
                    participated. But it's clear that the boy was simply there as a photographer. He
                    was carrying a camera; he was an amateur photographer. At any rate, this patrol
                    decided they had caught a couple of these communists who were causing all this
                    disturbance, and they poured gasoline on them and set fire to them. The girl was
                    badly burned; the boy was killed. Unfortunately for the Chilean army, the boy
                    was a legal permanent resident of the United States and had been attending a
                    high school in Maryland, I think, with the son of Charlie Hill who was George
                    Shultz's personal assistant. This was the Rodrigo Rojas case. The army took them
                    and dumped them into a ditch in some remote spot on the outskirts of town. The
                    girl eventually managed to flag down a vehicle and got taken to a hospital. The
                    Ambassador went to the boy's funeral. I almost went myself. The Ambassador was
                    taking one of his rare breaks at the seaside when the funeral was scheduled. It
                    was not clear if he was going to be able to get back to Santiago in time. It was
                    not easy to communicate anywhere outside Santiago. The telecommunication system
                    had not yet been privatized. I decided it was important for the United States to
                    be represented, and I was getting ready to go, and then I got word that the
                    Ambassador was on his way back to town and would go. As usual, Pinochet was
                    determined to manipulate the occasion. A photographer got a picture of Harry in
                    a room in which there was a big floral wreath from the Communist Party. The
                    right wing's version of this was that the Ambassador clearly had declared his
                    allegiance to the extreme left of Chile by going to this radical's funeral. Both
                    of these young people had leftist connections. That's why they had been watching
                    the street demonstration, which had been organized by the extreme and
                    near-extreme left. The moderate parties had largely given up on street
                    demonstrations by this point because they had not led to anything and had not
                    produced anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The funeral led to Senator Helms' visit to Chile shortly thereafter. A visit
                    which he made totally unannounced. We learned from the Chilean Government that
                    he was there; even the State Department didn't know. Harry sent a note over to
                    his hotel and welcomed him to Chile and said he was at his service and asked if
                    there was anything he could do. No response for several days. Finally on
                    Saturday morning, he received a phone call from one of the Senator's aides
                    saying the Senator would like him to come to the hotel and meet with him. So he
                    went off to see him. Harry is one of the more unflappable people I know. This
                    was one of the two or three occasions when I can remember his being visibly
                    angry and visibly upset when he came back from that meeting. He was clearly
                    treated in the most contemptuous manner. Helms and his aides had made up their
                    minds that this was a left wing ambassador who had allied himself with left wing
                    causes and was trying to undermine this noble government which was doing so much
                    good for Chile. It must have been a very unpleasant interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Helms make any statements to the press at the time,
                        talking about the glories of Pinochet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, there was an interview just as he was leaving Chile if I remember
                    correctly. But there was a still more interesting follow on to this whole saga.
                    A few days later, Bob Gelbard, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American
                    Affairs, came down to Chile on a visit, and Harry took him over to call on the
                    director of Chilean intelligence, who was an army general. And one of the very
                    few political generals, the only one who would ever dare to discuss politics
                    with us. He and the station chief had a good relationship, did a lot of
                    sparring, but you could a least talk to this guy. So many of the Army generals
                    you couldn't even get in to see, and when you got in to see them it was usually
                    to discuss some military visit, some exchange program, and just that and nothing
                    more. But General Gordon apparently had some sort of license from Pinochet to go
                    a little further than that. So he was a regular contact. In the course of the
                    conversation he said,” What is this I hear from Senator Helms about your having
                    a Chilean Army report, a report of the Chilean Army investigation that allegedly
                    establishes that it was an army patrol that burned the two teenagers.” I'm sure
                    they kept stone faces; Harry's poker face was very good. But wild alarm bells
                    began ringing because we did in fact have a copy of a Chilean Army report which
                    had been obtained through intelligence channels. It is one of the very few times
                    when I've seen a station chief absolutely pale with panic when he got back to
                    the embassy because one of his very good sources inside Chilean intelligence for
                    all he knew was about to be blown sky high. He could be taken away and tortured,
                    shot, anything. The Ambassador of course got on the secure phone to Washington
                    immediately.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>It turned out that the CIA had in fact briefed a staffer of Senator Helms about
                    the existence of this report. Given his well known publicly stated interest
                    about these events in Chile, the agency thought he should be aware of the
                    existence of this report in which the Chileans themselves had concluded that
                    this lieutenant who commanded this patrol had on his own decided to terminate
                    these teenagers with extreme prejudice. The staffer had of course briefed Helms.
                    Who exactly it was who called Chile probably will never be known, because I
                    suspect other staffers were told. Although General Gordon was very specific when
                    he said Helms, I suspect it was one of his staffers who called. Helms' office of
                    course denied that anyone had said anything to the Chileans, and this was a
                    gross calumny and atrocious lie intended to besmirch his reputation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, I don't think there is any question in this particular instance of
                    Chile. He believed that Pinochet had done a service to mankind in getting rid of
                    Allende. Everything he heard about what he had done with the economic system was
                    pro-free enterprise, he privatized things. Everything that he knew about
                    Pinochet was absolutely A+. For the minor defect of not holding elections, he
                    was being pilloried by the US Government. In a minor sidelight to the whole
                    incident, my son Michael, who was in Chile at the time, he had spent that
                    semester at Catholic University where he had the new experience of classes
                    opening by saying the Lord's Prayer every day. He had not run into that at Rice.
                    He was just winding up the semester when all this occurred. He went to the Rojas
                    funeral and provided an eyewitness account which gave me the pleasure of
                    reporting my son's observations in a telegram to the Department of State. I
                    described him as a knowledgeable American observer or something like that.</p>

                        put on the end that we have talked about events leading up close to the
                        plebiscite. Other things to talk about would be any human rights cases,
                        Americans in trouble, the next time. Also the book Missing and the movie
                        Missing. Were there still aftermaths to this. What was the feeling when you
                        arrived and all about America's involvement in the overthrow of Allende. Of
                        course it was years later but still it was an act of faith in the United
                        States, in academic and liberal circles, that we were much involved. I was
                        wondering what how this developed.</hi>

                <p>—Q: Today is the seventh of November 1996. George, Why don't we talk about some
                    of the things that really grabbed the headlines in the United States about
                    Chile. Some prior to your arrival but some of the reverberations were still
                    around. My first thing is, what is the common wisdom on American involvement in
                    the overthrow of Allende? Were you in Chile at this time?</p>
                <p>JONES: Of course the overthrow of Allende was way prior to my arrival, but as in
                    any country where there was real or suspected American involvement in the
                    overthrow of a government, no matter how long ago, you heard about it a lot. One
                    of the things you heard about in Chile was an incident involving an American
                    warship, the Baltimore, back in the 19th century. Apparently there was a real
                    threat of our going to war with Chile over this incident. There were some
                    sailors on shore leave who got into trouble.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they took down the Chilean flag and pissed on it

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Something egregious like that. You still heard about it from Chileans a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Valparaiso incident or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>JONES: There were a couple of good friends of mine, liberal democratic people who
                    wrote a book while I was there called, The United States and Chile, An
                    Ambivalent Relationship. They talked about that 19th century incident. Of course
                    one of the things that every foreign service officer experiences is that the
                    relationship with the United States is far more vivid in the other country than
                    it is in the United States. No American, unless they studied diplomatic history,
                    would have ever heard of this 19th century incident. Not many more will have
                    ever heard of Allende.</p>
                <p>[Tape obliterated by static at this point.]</p>
                <p>JONES: Curiously we heard more about it from the right than from the left. The
                    right would tell us that Allende had been overthrown partly at least thanks to
                    the United States. Although there were a few very fervent nationalists who
                    admitted no involvement by the United States. Usually it was thrown up to us as,
                    :you helped us get rid of that devil Allende. Now we have a good government and
                    here you are trying to overthrow it again. There is no logic to your policy, no
                    sense whatever to your policy.” So I would go back to giving my lecture on
                    democracy. What I emphasized was our consistent support for democracy, in 1973
                    and 1988. We didn't hear as much about it from the left in part because the
                    people most closely associated with Allende were in exile. The left was also
                    well aware that if it had any hope of getting rid of Pinochet it was going to be
                    as a consequence of international pressure primarily by the United States and
                    they needed the United States' help and support, so that was not the moment to
                    go around complaining about what we had done 15 years previously. I think
                    Nathaniel Davis' book My Two Years with Allende is the definitive factual record
                    of what occurred in 1971-73. There certainly was substantial US involvement.
                    Would it have happened had the US not gotten involved? You can ask the same
                    question about Pinochet. Did Allende fall any sooner as a result of, not to put
                    too fine a point on it, US subversion of the Allende regime? The disaster that
                    was occurring in Chile was such that I don't see how Allende could have lasted
                    much longer in any event. The military in particular were very much at pains to
                    say that they took the decision on their own, and that it had nothing whatever
                    to do with the United States. Admiral Merino, who just died the other day, was
                    the Naval member of the government junta during the time I was there. He was not
                    the original Navy member of the junta in 1973 but he later succeeded to the
                    Naval place on the junta. On one occasion when I was in his home at a dinner, he
                    told for what I'm sure was the 1000th time the story of his sitting in this very
                    chair and hearing an Allende speech or an Allende decision of some sort that was
                    simply the last straw. He pounded his pipe into the arm of the chair. Here's the
                    hole, he said; it is still here. At that moment he decided that Allende had to
                    be overthrown. It is a fact, that Merino was the instigator of the coup. He was
                    then commanding the ships off the coast of Valparaiso, and Pinochet was a late
                    and reluctant entrant into the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually Pinochet was something of a second choice wasn't
                        he? The first choice was killed in an automobile accident or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>JONES: The commander of the army was assassinated. Pinochet had just recently
                    been sworn in by Allende as commander in chief of the Army. But the other
                    military leaders were pressuring him very hard to join the coup. It was only at
                    the very last minute, I think it was the day before, that he told them he would
                    go along. If they thought he was going to remain the tail of the dog, they were
                    mistaken. The story that was told was they first realized how far they had let
                    their power slip when Pinochet began to make exclusive use of the Presidential
                    box at the Santiago Opera House, and if the other junta members wanted to use it
                    they had to go to him.</p>
                <p>I think the question of whether Pinochet would have left power if it had not been
                    for the United States is a much more difficult question. I have gone back and
                    forth on it in my own mind. I think that it would have been very difficult
                    without US support. Certainly US support alone would not have done the job if
                    you had not had many other elements present. Because the Carter Administration
                    had opposed Pinochet. We had imposed sanctions on him of various kinds, all of
                    which were totally ineffectual because the other circumstances were not there to
                    permit them to be effective. As I said last time, the absolutely key element to
                    Pinochet's departure was the insistence by his own closest supporters that there
                    be a plebiscite. Not only their insistence that there be one, but as the time
                    came closer, their insistence that it be a free and fair plebiscite. Now part of
                    the reason that they insisted on it, I'm not sure any of them would admit this,
                    but part of the reason was international pressure. I think if the United States
                    had been following the policy of the first Reagan term and was being buddy-buddy
                    with Pinochet and not complaining about the human rights situation at all,
                    certainly the question arises whether the right wing would have been so
                    sensitive to the question of whether there was going to be a free vote in
                    October 1988. Moreover, had the eyes of the world not been on Chile and had
                    there not been international observers in Chile for the plebiscite, then I think
                    that Pinochet in any of numerous ways would have gotten away with it. He would
                    have manipulated the situation or stolen it. The United States has very hard
                    evidence that he was trying to do that right up to the very last moment. My
                    conclusion is that although certainly a lot of Chilean effort was essential in
                    getting rid of Pinochet, another essential element was strong pressure by the
                    United States. We said, OKAY it is your decision to hold this plebiscite. It
                    wasn't our idea; it didn't come from us, but your constitution provides for this
                    plebiscite, then let's see you hold it and respect the decision that comes out.
                    I never held a conversation with a Chilean who suggested... about the only
                    Chilean who suggested, not to us of course, that it might not be a free and fair
                    plebiscite was Pinochet himself. The left feared that it might not be, but the
                    right wing was absolutely determined to convince us that it was going to be free
                    and fair. Mainly their worry was Pinochet is going to win this of course, and if
                    he wins it, will the United States respect his victory? That was the question we
                    got over and over again from the right.</p>

                        was “missing”. He really was.</hi>

                <p>JONES: Missing and dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say was any of that still hanging around when

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well the movie was part of a whole series of movies by a leftist
                    film-maker named Costa Gravas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Z” had an impact on our relations with a couple of
                        dictatorships.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I remember hearing at the time that “Z” came out that the foreign service
                    entrance examination boards were using it as a question, to find out whether the
                    candidates would recognize that “Z,” whatever its merits artistically, was in
                    fact political propaganda in the broadest sense of the term. That it was
                    designed to advance a particular political cause. You can say the same thing
                    about “Missing.” It was designed to paint the worst possible picture of the
                    Chilean coup leaders, and it was done by depriving people totally of the context
                    that at the time of the coup it was supported by a great majority of Chileans.
                    In fact during the '88 plebiscite campaign the Pinochet forces dug up and used
                    an old black and white film of an interview with Patricio Aylwin, who was the
                    leader of the Christian Democratic Party and therefore the leader of the
                    opposition forces and later, 1990-1994, became the President of Chile. Patricio
                    Aylwin was being interviewed right after the coup by some European newspaper and
                    he was trying to put it into context. Why did this happen? Well it happened
                    because Allende led the country into political and economic disaster. You may
                    recall that the housewives were putting chickens outside the homes of military
                    officers to get across the message that they had to do something.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Having said all of that, the core story in “Missing” is there really was an
                    American who was killed by security forces at the time of the overthrow. His
                    father, Jack Lemmon in the movie, came down to Chile and actually found his
                    body. The picture of the US Ambassador who was Nathaniel Davis was more than
                    unflattering; it left a clear implication that Davis was a party to this, that
                    he was aware of the boy's being killed and saw nothing wrong with it in effect.
                    Davis sued the movie company. He had every reason to sue. The movie told lies.
                    The US embassy was doing everything it could do to protect US citizens. It was a
                    bloody overthrow. I think somebody's count was 1200 or so people killed, not
                    only at the immediate time of the overthrow, but in the years immediately
                    afterwards. By, I guess '76-'78, the killings had stopped. The fervor to just
                    stamp out anybody who was allied with Allende had ceased. For one thing many of
                    them had fled into exile or been expelled. A number were in prison of course. In
                    that sense, Pinochet's human rights record improved after that point. There were
                    no more documented case of people being executed on government orders; the Rojas
                    murder was clearly the work of an overzealous lieutenant. This is not to say
                    that Pinochet's human rights record was good by any means. Certainly there were
                    imprisonments of people who had no reason to be imprisoned. Internal exile was a
                    tactic they were particularly fond of. Chile is a country with many bleak places
                    and they would send somebody off to a tiny island in the middle of a lake or to
                    some extremely cold part of Chile or some extreme desert part of Chile and hold
                    them with the most minimal contact with the outside world, one phone call a
                    month or something like that. Of course demonstrations were broken up; people
                    were beaten over the head with clubs, all that kind of thing, but at least the
                    urge to exterminate had calmed down after the first wave of fervor.</p>
                <p>But of course one of the things that had taken place in that period of
                    “revolutionary fervor” was what was then the only act of foreign political
                    terrorism ever to be committed on American soil. I guess it is still the only
                    such act to be committed in the nation's capital. That was the assassination of
                    Orlando Letelier, who had been Allende's Foreign Minister and was in exile in
                    the United States and was working for a Washington think tank called The
                    Institute for Policy Studies. He and an associate, Ronnie Moffat, and her
                    husband, were in a car driving to work when a car bomb that had been placed
                    under Letelier's seat, went off as they were going around Sheridan Circle.</p>

                    one of the things about our mission in Chile that was crystal clear was to

                    Letelier case. There is a long history to it that I won't go into. There is a
                    fascinating book written by a former US District Attorney which covers all the
                    early stages of the case. People had already been tried; some of them convicted
                    in the case by the time I came to Chile. But in 1986 a Chilean whose name I had
                    better not use even at this late date, came to see me, someone whom I had
                    contact with on several different occasions. He was an interesting source of
                    political views and analysis. One day out of the blue he came to see me and said
                    that he had a friend who was in the Chilean Army and had been among the
                    group—I'm sure he did not tell me all of this at the beginning; it came out bit
                    by bit—he had been among the group that had traveled to the United States to
                    assassinate Letelier. This was an army Major named Armando Fernandez Larios. He
                    said that Fernandez was fed up with his situation. Again this was not in the
                    first conversation, but there were many meetings as all of this developed. He
                    had been taken off normal Army duties, he wasn't doing anything, drawing a
                    salary, but he had been relieved of duties. Number one, he was bored, and number
                    two he didn't like what this might mean. Was he going to be forced out of the
                    Army? I'm sure that something worse went through his mind. He wanted to talk to
                    someone in the Embassy about his situation. That's not quite right, because he
                    was very much afraid of talking directly to anyone in the Embassy and for that
                    matter so were we. At this point we had no way of knowing if this were a set-up
                    or what it was. He wanted to exchange some information through our mutual friend
                    and see whether, under what circumstances, how might he be treated if he went to
                    the United States. It turned out he had a sister who lived in New York. In fact
                    it turned out to our great surprise, much later on in this, that he had in fact
                    been born in Washington. The son of a Chilean officer who was an Attach� in the
                    Chilean Embassy. As the son of a foreign diplomat he had no claim to US
                    citizenship, although it intrigued us at the time. As it turned out, his sister
                    had been urging him to get out and get away from all this. So long exchanges
                    with Washington ensued. Of course the case was in the hands of the FBI. The US
                    attorney's office was very interested and the State Department as well. But
                    there was also a lot of caution. There were all kinds of problems. As usual we
                    had to contend with the skeptics who contended that there was no way this could
                    be done. How on earth is this guy going to be gotten out of Chile? Being an Army
                    officer, is he going to walk up to the airport and fly to the United States?
                    That is not at all likely. We are going to have to tell him that he is going to
                    be subject to prosecution in the United States for his role in the
                    assassination. If you tell him this is he still going to come? No way.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>As I recall, months went by before we could get Washington to decide anything.
                    Sounds familiar to any of us who have ever been in the Foreign Service. But
                    finally as a result of persistent banging on Washington and a continuing
                    development of our indirect relationship with Fernandez Larios, we began to get
                    some movement. My most dramatic involvement was a time in November 1986, when
                    finally after much hand wringing and soul searching it was decided on both
                    sides, Fernandez Larios' and the US Government's side, that it would be useful
                    for there to be a face to face contact. The Ambassador had put me in charge of
                    the case. In fact he didn't want anybody else in the Embassy, except the station
                    chief, to know anything about this. So I was deprived of the usual staff that
                    might have helped on this. I did all the telegrams myself, because we were so
                    concerned about all these aspects, including the aspect that if somehow word got
                    out, that Fernandez Larios would disappear into a military cell and never be
                    seen again until you heard the noise of the firing squad. So it was decided that
                    I was the only person that could go and see him.</p>
                <p>I talked to one of the Embassy secretaries and said I'd like to use your
                    apartment for a meeting. I'd like to arrange for you to be somewhere else. We
                    wanted to hold it on safe territory and have some reasonable assurance that it
                    was not going to be bugged. It was not reasonable to believe that Pinochet's
                    police would have bugged the secretary's apartment. So I went home, and in Chile
                    as in Costa Rica I had a bodyguard who was with me at all times. So I told the
                    driver and I told the bodyguard, “That's all for today. Nothing else on the
                    schedule for today.” They thought it was very peculiar that I was home at that
                    hour of the afternoon and peculiar that I wasn't going anywhere else. “Are you
                    sure you don't want us to stick around?” “No!”</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>As soon as they were out of sight, I grabbed a bottle of scotch which I always
                    found to be helpful in breaking the ice in a Latin environment and put it into a
                    paper sack and went out and caught a taxi, the only time I ever caught a taxi in
                    Chile in front of my own house, and went to the apartment—the nearest thing to
                    playing cloak and dagger that I ever got involved in. I met with Fernandez
                    Larios and although he was very wary, the ice did get broken. We got a number of
                    things straightened out face to face that hadn't been earlier. There were
                    certain countries he could travel to without a passport, so we went through a
                    stage where we were trying to set up a meeting in Argentina. His contact in
                    Argentina was going to be CIA. I don't recall now why, I guess because the FBI
                    at this point was still extremely skittish about having anything to do with
                    this. I don't know whether CIA work is really like John LeCarre or whether they
                    modeled it on John LeCarre for my benefit. At any rate, I was told to tell
                    Fernandez about the rolled up magazine as a sign of identification and the
                    contact phrase to be used and everything else.But Fernandez Larios decided
                    against Argentina. Another of the complications was that his sister had hired
                    him a lawyer, and this American lawyer came down from New York and was far more
                    nervous than anyone else involved. He had visions of being hauled off by the
                    secret police and never heard of again. I guess he had seen “Missing.” He was
                    always giving very nervous advice to Fernandez Larios. The FBI finally sent some
                    people down to Santiago. Once that happened they began to get committed, to say
                    OKAY this is real; it may actually happen. It was finally worked out that
                    Fernandez would be willing to get on board a plane. The CIA station had checked
                    and found out that his name wasn't in the Chilean lookout book. They had someone
                    who had access to the airport computers and established that as near as they
                    could tell, if he tried to leave, his name wasn't going to come up on any kind
                    of screen. So he decided he was prepared to risk it. He got on a plane for Rio
                    de Janeiro. The FBI agreed to meet him.</p>
                <p>The most dramatic single meeting that I ever had in the Foreign Service was when
                    I called a meeting of the Emergency Action Committee, which was the group that
                    mainly worried about threats to the Embassy, but included all the senior people,
                    the station chief, the attach�, the political officer, the security officer and
                    so on. I got them all sitting down and told them that a Chilean Army Major on
                    active duty was now in the air on his way to Rio de Janeiro where he would be
                    met by FBI agents and taken to the United States and placed under arrest and
                    tried for complicity in the Letelier case. I think I had the most stunned
                    audience that I ever had in my career as well. It all worked beautifully, no
                    problems at all. Then the Ambassador and I went to see the Interior Minister,
                    who was not a bad guy, at his home. Within the Pinochet cabinet certainly one of
                    the least far right wing, and we broke the news to him. We had another stunned
                    audience. I certainly hated to do it to him and complicate his life.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Fernandez Larios appeared in US federal court and testified against the Pinochet
                    government. I'm not sure whether he was given any prison time or if he served a
                    suspended sentence. It seems to me it was the latter. And then he went into the
                    witness protection program which was part of the deal. He is presumably still
                    living somewhere in the United States. It was an extraordinary event, and in
                    addition to helping resolve the Letelier case, it helped the return of democracy
                    to Chile. It was enormously embarrassing to the Pinochet government that this
                    had occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume they had been denying the whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh yes! And continued to deny it. But they could not deny that Fernandez
                    had gotten away, that it had been possible for that to occur. As in any
                    dictatorship, part of its success is its image of invincibility. When you
                    demonstrate they can be outmaneuvered in their own territory, it damages their
                    own opinion of themselves along with everybody else's. It also enabled us to
                    reactivate the whole case. The Chilean courts had denied extradition of the two
                    senior Chilean Army officers who we knew were responsible for the assassination,
                    General Contreras, who was head of the Chilean intelligence agency at the time
                    of the assassination, retired at the time I was there, and another general whose
                    name escapes me at the moment. The request for extradition had been turned down
                    because the Chilean courts had said there was insufficient evidence to support
                    it. Now we had new evidence and we could go back in. During my time, we didn't
                    actually accomplish anything further. We sent dozens of diplomatic notes and all
                    kinds of other actions, but we laid the groundwork for the legal action which
                    took place after Pinochet's departure, which eventually led. not to Contreras'
                    extradition, but we had always said in the diplomatic approaches, that either
                    extradition or trial in Chile was acceptable to us, either one or the other. A
                    trial in Chile eventually occurred; Contreras was sentenced. Pinochet, who is
                    still today commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army, made one last effort to keep
                    him out of prison, but in the end yielded and let him go. So in the end it was a
                    successful law enforcement/diplomatic effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result of their involvement in this, I would have
                        thought that the senior Embassy officers would have suffered somewhat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>JONES: No we didn't. We suffered a lot more from the Rojas case that we talked
                    about the last time than we did from the Letelier case. The level of Chilean
                    embarrassment over Letelier was extremely high. I mean for all Chileans. Anybody
                    who wasn't totally blinded by hero worship of Pinochet knew perfectly well what
                    had happened. Contreras had planned and ordered Letelier's murder, the only
                    uncertainty in everybody's mind was to what extent Pinochet was personally
                    involved, whether Contreras did it without his knowledge or under some vague
                    general authority from Pinochet. To many of us it was inconceivable that
                    Contreras would have taken this serious an action without checking with Pinochet
                    first. Pinochet controlled and managed everything in his government. But we had
                    no evidence of that; Contreras never said anything of course. As I recall some
                    of Fernandez Larios' testimony was suggestive on that point, but no hard fact.
                    So we never accused Pinochet and Chileans never talked about his possible
                    involvement. But I don't think I ever talked to anybody who tried to argue that
                    Contreras hadn't done this. The argument instead was, if the chief of your CIA
                    was accused of something like this, would you extradite him to another country?
                    How could you expect us to do that? Knowing all the secrets that he knows, would
                    you hand him over to another foreign power? To which we had the very fortunate
                    reply, “Fine, then try him in Chile.” We always said that would be perfectly
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>The Fernandez Larios business was in late '86, early '87. The plebiscite was
                    October 1988. There were a number of amazing aspects to it. As part of the deal,
                    as part of Pinochet's decision to permit... I just realized, I haven't said
                    anything about the assassination attempt on Pinochet. Still another chapter. An
                    assassination attempt in September of 1987. It was one of the most beautiful
                    examples of extra sensory perception by a senior State Department official that
                    I have ever seen. Robert Gelbard, who is not universally loved in the Foreign
                    Service, was senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs. I was
                    due for home leave, and my home leave kept getting delayed for a variety of
                    reasons, but I finally got away. The Ambassador wanted very much to go off on
                    some leave of his own. By the time I could get off it worked out that toward the
                    end of my leave, we were both going to be away. If he was going to take his
                    leave when he wanted it, and I took my full home leave we were going to have to
                    have the third ranking person in the Embassy in charge. The Ambassador, who was
                    a great believer in delegation downwards, said, “ Fine, why not? The world won't
                    come to an end.” So I went off on my home leave, and in due course he went off
                    on his leave. I was out in Colorado visiting one of our children, and I got a
                    phone call from Gelbard's office saying that it was absolutely unacceptable for
                    both Harry and me to be absent from Chile. Since the Ambassador had left, he
                    wanted me to get myself back down there right away. So I had the world's
                    shortest home leave. I got on the plane and got back to Chile.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>I had barely gotten back, like two or three days after, when the Communists made
                    a nearly successful attempt to assassinate Pinochet. It turned out that they had
                    gotten a substantial arsenal of weaponry from the Cubans, which just like that
                    boatload of arms in Venezuela in the 1960's, had been clandestinely delivered to
                    an isolated point on Chile's long seacoast and stored in a cave. The Chilean
                    Communists had taken the most useful items, notably RPG's, rocket propelled
                    grenades, and planned an assassination attempt. Pinochet had a little farm out
                    in a mountain valley about an hour away from Santiago, which was actually owned
                    by the Chilean army. It had been acquired for his benefit, but was not
                    technically in his name. It was known that he went out there on weekends, and
                    there was only one road to and from the place, so it was easy for the Communists
                    to know that he was going to be returning along this particular road sometime in
                    the late afternoon. So they set up an ambush, and it was very nearly successful.
                    There were at least a couple of people killed. But one of his prudent security
                    measures was that there were several identical cars, identical Mercedes, that
                    were used, and they did not know which one he was in. Also these rockets had to
                    travel a certain distance before they were armed, and they were not skilled in
                    the use of these. The Cubans had not sent down any trainers with the weapons,
                    and they fired several of them too close to the cars with the result they made
                    dents but didn't penetrate. The cars were bulletproofed. Pinochet got a small
                    cut on the hand and that was it. The famous story was that after it was all
                    over, he looked at the pattern in the bulletproof glass of his car that had been
                    made by one of the rockets, and concluded that it looked like the Virgin, which
                    was yet another proof for him of divine protection of his rule.</p>
                <p>Shortly afterwards the part of the arsenal that was still in storage was
                    discovered. A fisherman or something ran across it along the coast. We provided
                    some technical assistance to the Chileans in tracking the weapons and
                    identifying where they had come from. It provided a useful opportunity for us to
                    make the point that we were just as much opposed to extremism of the left as
                    extremism of the right. We did not support violent solutions in Chile. I went as
                    charg� to visit one of Pinochet's guards in the hospital, and held a press
                    conference on the hospital steps to make those points. It was the second lead in
                    El Mercurio the next day.</p>
                <p>That was sort of the last gasp of the extreme left. I think there were some
                    things that happened much later on after Pinochet left. There was no significant
                    effort against Pinochet after that. It must have been extremely demoralizing to
                    them to have come so close and not succeeded. Of course he tried to avoid
                    offering them such another easy opportunity.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>So along came the plebiscite in 1988. Pinochet made the decision, I'm sure with
                    much reluctance but under heavy pressure from his own people, that at least to
                    some extent, this had to be played honestly and fairly. So an opposition
                    newspaper was licensed for the first time in 15 years. Advertising time was
                    permitted on television, very rigorously limited, but there was to be half an
                    hour once a week, late in the evening, 9:30-10:00, of which 15 minutes would be
                    available to those who supported a vote of yes in the plebiscite for Pinochet to
                    stay on and 15 minutes for those who favored a vote of no. I think the view in
                    the United States is that under no circumstances does a dictator ever play fair.
                    Pinochet is an interesting example that under certain circumstances where there
                    are reasons and incentives, they do play fair. This had an enormous impact in
                    Chile, that for the first time in 15 years political discussion was being
                    permitted publicly. The forces of the “no,” who by this time had gained some
                    self confidence and a sense of organization, the forces of opposition to
                    Pinochet, they went to some very good advertising people who worked for Chilean
                    advertising firms and designed a series of brilliant 15-minute political
                    programs. On the whole very reassuring, very moderate. Nothing to give
                    ammunition to those who claimed that the opposition were a bunch of
                    fire-breathing radicals who would destroy Chile if they are ever permitted back
                    in.</p>
                <p>Political demonstrations were permitted. Only a very few of them, rigorously
                    controlled. Nevertheless you had the first legal political demonstrations in
                    Chile in 15 years. The rallies, the marches for the opposition were massive. So
                    we were pretty hopeful how things were going to go in the plebiscite, but not at
                    all sure what Pinochet was going to do. As I mentioned earlier we had all kinds
                    of reports of things he was thinking about doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the leaders of the community?
                        What did they think was going to happen? The Chileans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well the people on the right were still insisting that Pinochet was going
                    to win, although more and more nervously as time went by. Some obvious things
                    like the television campaign and the opposition rallies gave them cause for
                    concern. The people in the opposition, many of them were sticking to their
                    standard 15-year line that Pinochet is not going to permit this to happen; he'll
                    figure out something to do. But they were willing to put this aside and say we
                    are willing to give this a try, which is what we had been urging them to do. By
                    early in '88 the debate in the opposition was settled and they had agreed to go
                    full tilt to contest the plebiscite. They weren't going to boycott it. They
                    weren't going to say it was all a farce. They were going to go at this seriously
                    and give it everything they had.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>On the night of the plebiscite, the scheme was that the Minister of the Interior,
                    who now was a much harder line person than the one we talked about in the
                    Letelier case, the Minister of the Interior was going to come on TV and
                    personally read the returns. He came on early in the evening and read some very
                    partial returns, some tiny percent of the vote showing Pinochet ahead, showing
                    the “yes” ahead, and then silence. In fact the TV stations that were under
                    government control switched to American sitcoms. Everybody sat there chewing
                    their fingernails wondering what was going to happen next. What happened was
                    first of all another ex-Interior Minister of Pinochet's, a very prominent figure
                    of the right was interviewed on the Catholic University station which was not
                    under government control, kind of a talk show together with the leader of the
                    opposition. That very friendly and amicable discussion helped to set the tone
                    that the world was not going to come to an end if the “No” won. Then in the wee
                    hours of the morning it became known that the junta was going to meet at the
                    Presidential Palace. Of course we had information coming in from quick counts
                    that were being done. I think there were at least a couple. One was being done
                    by the opposition and there was another one that was being done by the National
                    Democratic Institute which was there in force. So we knew that the “No” was
                    winning, but it had not been announced publicly. The TV stations got their
                    cameramen to the entrance to the palace and filmed the members of the junta
                    going in, and they stopped the commander of the Air Force, General Matthei, and
                    asked, General, how are things going? He said, “Well, it seems to me the “No” is
                    winning.” General Matthei and the commander of the Carabineros, the Chilean
                    police, General Stange, were the two members of the junta who had assured us
                    privately that the results of the plebiscite were going to be respected. We were
                    sure that they were among those at the time who were urging Pinochet that this
                    had to be an honest plebiscite, and that he had to abide by the results of it.
                    That was the crucial event, because once Matthei said that on camera, of course
                    he did that very deliberately, and he did it going into the meeting with
                    Pinochet knowing that whatever happened inside, Pinochet's hands were going to
                    be tied by what Matthei had said outside. They got in and Pinochet gave them a
                    copy of a draft decree, suspending the plebiscite in essence and going back to
                    the drawing board, and they all refused to sign it. So he threw up his arms and
                    said in effect that it was all over. After that a very glum Interior Minister
                    went back on TV, not having been seen for five or six hours, and started
                    reporting the results. The next morning there were something like a million
                    people on the streets and parks of downtown Santiago. Very peaceful, very
                    orderly, but a tremendously joyful celebration.</p>
                <p>Chile is the country of my most bizarre experiences. The last thing I'm going to
                    tell you about Chile is even more bizarre than all these bizarre stories I've
                    told you so far. That was the story of the poisoned grape. Timing in life is
                    everything. You are always hearing about people, Clark Clifford is a great
                    example. If he had only died in time, how well off he would have been. You stick
                    around too long, you get into trouble.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Had I left Chile as Harry Barnes did in November of '88 right after the
                    plebiscite, we would have all been covered in glory both externally and
                    internally in Chile and the US. It would have been great. Tony Gillespie came in
                    as Ambassador. The agreement was that I would stick around for about six months
                    after he got there before leaving myself, to help him get his feet on the ground
                    and get started. I guess it was right around the turn of the year, we got an
                    anonymous phone call. Somebody called up the Embassy out of the blue and said
                    that he had injected cyanide into grapes that were being shipped to the United
                    States. I'm trying to remember what he used as a justification for this. It was
                    nothing political. I mean he didn't say this was because of the plebiscite or
                    the Rodrigo Rojas case or anything like that. I think it was to the effect that
                    he didn't have a job, and the economy was going to hell, and nobody would listen
                    to him. So he just wanted to warn us that he had taken this dramatic act of
                    protest. Well, what the heck do you do? Of course you report this. Bearing in
                    mind all of the injunctions from Washington about not over classifying, we sent
                    it in unclassified. Absolutely nothing to protect about this phone call. But
                    that of course meant that it went to the Department of Agriculture, US Customs
                    and all these agencies in Washington who had no ability to discriminate between
                    one kind of information and another, and they halted the importation of Chilean
                    grapes over the weekend. When we found out about it the State Department was
                    horrified; we were horrified. We were told sternly never to send anything like
                    this in unclassified ever again. You can't let Agriculture get their hands on a
                    State Department cable for gosh sakes. With a lot of frantic work by the Embassy
                    and by the State Department we persuaded them to release the grapes and start
                    importing them normally again. And in fact it was even by a miracle kept out of
                    the papers because we had gotten it turned around again fairly quickly. The
                    grape exporters of course knew what had happened. Once again I was charg�. All
                    of these things seemed to happen when I was charg�, and I had the honor of
                    calling them in and apologizing and explaining what had happened and so on, the
                    heads of the major exporting associations. And so we breathed a huge sigh of
                    relief; things were back to normal.</p>
                <p>Then this guy called again, and assured us that you haven't found it but I did
                    poison those grapes. I just want to assure you of that. So we reported that,
                    classified this time. As a result of the second report, the fruit inspectors for
                    the Department of Agriculture began a very intensive search. They didn't stop
                    the importation this time, but they began a very intensive sampling of imported
                    grapes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might mention that Chilean grapes are a mainstay in
                        every supermarket in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>JONES: During the winter because we have opposite seasons. Chilean grapes are
                    grown when the snow is on the ground in the US, and vice-versa. Our two markets
                    fit together relatively well. Lo and behold, on a Sunday I think, an inspector
                    found a couple of strange looking grapes, literally two out of hundreds of
                    thousands if not millions of grapes, and what looked to him like a couple of
                    puncture marks. They were rushed off to the laboratory. On a Monday morning we
                    got the call that the lab tests from the Food and Drug Administration had shown
                    traces of cyanide. Boom! The Food and Drug Commissioner ordered not only the
                    cessation of imports of Chilean grapes, but ordered all Chilean grapes taken off
                    the shelves of American supermarkets and destroyed. Bearing in mind the Tylenol
                    case and other instances where people had discovered poisonous substances in
                    products on the shelves, there being no way to tell how many additional bottles
                    of Tylenol had been poisoned, so the solution was to get them all off the
                    shelves. And of course, at this point it did go public. The Food and Drug
                    Administration made a public announcement. Here we thought we had just
                    established the best possible US- Chilean relations and laid the groundwork for
                    Pinochet's departure and everything else, and this thing hits us in the face.
                    Demonstrations in the front of the Embassy. And then to return to your question
                    about the effect this had on senior people at the Embassy. In contrast to the
                    Letelier case, where there was no accusation of personal involvement or personal
                    bias at all, in the grape case there was a prominent Chilean, not in the first
                    rank but in the second rank of prominence, named Ricardo Claro. He was an
                    attorney; he was president of Santa Rita Vineyards; he was president of the
                    Chilean-American cultural center. He was a regular lunch companion of mine. He
                    gave everybody to believe for years that he was basically anti-Pinochet,
                    although he confessed to me at the time of the plebiscite that he had voted for
                    Pinochet. The other thing is that he was a stockholder in a shipping company
                    that shipped grapes to the United States. He decided, this otherwise apparently
                    rational man, an attorney for a number of prominent American companies, he
                    decided that the United States Government was responsible for this. Among many
                    other things, he had a morning radio show, a five or ten minute broadcast in
                    which he commented on various things that were going on in Chile. He began to
                    use his radio broadcast to attack both Tony Gillespie and much more intensely,
                    me, for having personally plotted this as a means of getting Pinochet out
                    sooner. Because under the Constitution, Pinochet was to stay until March of
                    1990. There would be Presidential elections in the fall of 1989, so he was going
                    to be around for a while. This was both punishment for Pinochet and a means of
                    getting him out sooner. Of course, he never spoke about the fact there was
                    personal punishment for Claro's pocketbook. Some of his ships' cargoes became
                    worthless; there was substantial economic impact on him personally and on a
                    number of other prominent Chileans. He held a press conference announcing his
                    resignation as president of the cultural center and saying he wanted nothing
                    further to do with the United States. Just the bitterest kind of attack. I spent
                    the last two or three months in Chile defending myself to the right wing. The
                    left wing generally kept their mouths shut with puzzlement and bafflement. The
                    right wing unleashed all of the bitterness they had piled up over the plebiscite
                    and many other things and said this was the last straw that the United States
                    would do this. “Of course it was political. You mean to tell me the State
                    Department doesn't tell the Food and Drug Administration what to do! You're
                    lying through your teeth. This is all a calculated administration decision to
                    punish Chile.” I mean it was unbelievably bad. Just about as hostile an
                    atmosphere as we could possibly have. A terrible start for Tony in his mission.
                    I could get out of there in a couple of months but he had to stay.</p>

                    looking for another assignment.</p>
                <p>JONES: Well, actually it started before I left Chile. Personnel suggested that I
                    come up to Washington in late March or early April of that year and talk about
                    potential onward assignments. That of course was at the beginning of the Bush
                    administration and a change in personnel once again in the ARA. Bernie Aronson
                    was coming in as Assistant Secretary. He was one of the people that I went to
                    see, one of the people I was most interested in seeing. He had not been sworn in
                    yet, but he had a small office in ARA and was assembling his staff. I would have
                    been very interested in a Deputy Assistant Secretary position or an
                    Ambassadorship at that stage. But in talking to Bernie and to others, I gathered
                    that the pickings were slim in those categories. I had hear that the job of
                    National Security Advisor for Latin America was going to be coming open. Bob
                    Pasterino, who was in it, would be leaving shortly. Toward the end of my
                    conversation with Bernie, I asked him, when it became clear that I was striking
                    out in other directions, I said, “Well, I understand that the NSC job is going
                    to be opening up.” He said, “Now that is a very good idea. You would be very
                    good for that. Let me look into that and we'll get back to you.” We stood up to
                    go and I said, “There is one thing you should be aware of as you explore this
                    possibility, that I am very likely on Senator Helms' list.” He grimaced and
                    said, “Oh, what for?” I said,” Just for being in Chile. Just for being Harry
                    Barnes' deputy. He is bitterly antagonistic toward Ambassador Barnes, and it is
                    very likely that it has rubbed off on me.” He said nothing further. I wasn't
                    sure anything was going to happen. I had made it clear that I was wearing my
                    scarlet “A”. The next thing that happened was that I was told I had an interview
                    at the White House with the Deputy National Security Advisor and went over and
                    talked with him.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Gates. Bob Gates. And a fairly brief interview, he looked at my r�sum� and
                    said, “This looks very impressive.” But he sort of left it open, and I still
                    wasn't sure where this was heading. Very shortly afterwards, I got a call saying
                    would I come to see Brent Scowcroft, the President's National Security Advisor?
                    So I put on my best suit and trundled back to the White House a second time and
                    had a brief meeting with Scowcroft in which he offered me the job. He stuck out
                    his hand and we shook on it, and he asked me how soon I could start. I said,
                    “Well I do have a family I left behind in Chile and all our household effects
                    and I would like to be able to get down there and put some things in order, as
                    usual I will have to leave my wife to do all the packing, but I can at least get
                    started on it.” So we agreed on my starting in a couple of weeks. He said I
                    should go see the administrative people, so I went to see them and start
                    processing in. I was flying back to Chile that evening, so I went over to the
                    State Department. I had lunch with the Deputy Latin American Advisor, and we
                    talked about how the office might be run. There was an issue as to where it
                    might be located, what office space we might have, and we talked about things
                    like that, and I received various and sundry congratulations from people around
                    ARA and then I got on the plane and flew back to Chile.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday of the following week, three or four days later, I got a phone call
                    from Bob Kozak, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary at that point. The unpleasant
                    task had trickled down the line from Scowcroft to I don't know how many other
                    people in between and the buck finally stopped with Mike. He told me that
                    sometime over the weekend, the senior senator from North Carolina had called
                    Scowcroft and said that I was personally unacceptable to him. So despite the
                    handshake, the offer was being withdrawn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, this is no fancy appointment. I mean
                        it is a good working man's position in the Foreign Service. It is not an
                        Ambassadorship; it is not a Deputy Secretary. I mean it is a good solid one,
                        but it is not going to come up on Helms' radar unless somebody is really
                        working at it. Do you have any idea who was blowing the whistle? I mean it
                        sounds like there is a mole in ARA or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, Helms had this staff of people who shared his distaste for the
                    Foreign Service in general. How much he was personally aware and how much he was
                    acting on memos put before him by his staff I don't know. Part of the background
                    to this I learned later. I heard one vivid version of it from a retired
                    colleague just a couple of months ago. The conservatives in the Republican Party
                    who were interested in Latin America were very upset by Aronson's appointment,
                    because Aronson had been a lifelong Democrat and probably still regards himself
                    as one. He had been a speech writer for Walter Mondale, had worked with labor
                    unions and other “unsavory” organizations. Having lost that battle, they were
                    very interested in having someone conservative in the Latin American job at the
                    NSC . Of course during the first part of the Reagan administration, they had
                    Constantine Menges, whom I think I mentioned in an earlier tape, who was
                    entirely a soul mate. So from their standpoint, it had only gone downhill, and
                    would go still further downhill. That would have been their view even if I
                    hadn't been in Chile. I was a foreign service officer of no known conservative
                    leanings and that was bad enough. But of course, Chile was clearly part of it. I
                    think at least his staff was out to prevent the upward movement of anyone who
                    had been associated with what they regarded as a mistaken, indeed a criminal,
                    policy in Chile. So, there I was. We left Chile in May which was a little
                    earlier than I had originally been scheduled to leave, but later than I would
                    have left had I gone into the NSC job. At that point we didn't have much
                    enthusiasm for sticking around. Plus, now that all bets were off in terms of an
                    onward assignment, it was important that I get back to Washington as quickly as
                    possible to start walking the corridors, as the expression goes. And that is
                    exactly what I did. So I was essentially in limbo, an experience common to a lot
                    of senior officers, for the next several months. There were a couple of Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary positions open that I interviewed for, but the Assistant
                    Secretaries already had somebody in mind. I was being interviewed because
                    Personnel was telling them I was a deserving case that ought to be considered. A
                    good friend of mine was Director of Mexican Affairs and he asked me if I would
                    undertake to organize the annual meeting of the Binational Commission which is a
                    committee of members of the US and Mexican cabinets. They were meeting in Mexico
                    City in September, so I did the organizational work on that. It kept me busy.
                    But nothing else was turning up.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Finally one day I ran into another friend of mine who was president of the
                    American Foreign Service Association, AFSA. He had just come into office and his
                    vice president who had been elected with him had decided to retire and was
                    therefore leaving the position and would I be interested? The more I thought
                    about it the more I thought this would be fun to do for awhile. The Department
                    seconds two people to AFSA, the president and the vice president, so it would
                    mean no loss in salary and benefits, and it would be an opportunity to do some
                    work on behalf of the Foreign Service as a whole. So I told him yes. I spent a
                    few days working myself into that job and finally had my future settled. Maria
                    and I decided to go off on vacation for a couple of weeks. But while I was on
                    vacation, Mike Kozak called again and said, “How would you like to go as
                    Ambassador to Guyana?” I thought about it overnight and talked to my wife and
                    said, “Sure!” It was not the ambassadorship in a Spanish-speaking country that I
                    had hoped would come my way, but it was an Ambassadorship and it was a bird in
                    the hand.I continued to work at AFSA over the next year as I went through the
                    process of filling out all the forms and getting them approved by everybody, all
                    the clearances done, State Department security, FBI, IRS, White House Counsel,
                    etc. Finally in June of 1990, the nomination was sent to the Senate. I was told
                    that the Bush Administration very sensibly had dropped that peculiar Reagan
                    Administration practice of having a political and a Foreign Service candidate
                    for the same job. I had the assurance of knowing that I was the one and only
                    candidate, and that I had been previously approved. My name had gone from State
                    to the White House and had been approved before the job was even offered to me.
                    In addition, as a double guarantee to keep things from going wrong on
                    Ambassadorial appointments, the Bush administration had instituted the custom of
                    pre-clearance on the Hill. Before the nomination went forward, they had checked
                    it out with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I was told that no
                    objections had been raised. I was greatly relieved to hear that. This fit in
                    with what Kozak had told me the theory was in ARA, namely that Helms was not
                    going to care about Guyana. They had concluded they might have problems if they
                    tried to send me to any larger, more significant country but for Guyana there
                    would be no problem. Well, they were wrong.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>It was never explained what went wrong with the pre-clearance, whether it went to
                    the wrong Helms aide or whether somebody just slipped up or my name didn't ring
                    a bell or what. As the summer wore on it became clear that Helms continued to
                    have strenuous objections to my appointment. A hearing was finally held in
                    October. I was going through with Jack Leonard who had just been DCM in
                    Nicaragua and was going as Ambassador to Suriname, and with Phil Hughes, a
                    political appointee going to Barbados. We went up together for the great
                    victory; a hearing was finally scheduled. Helms' first tactic was always to
                    block hearings, because there is a rule that you can't hold a hearing while the
                    Senate is in session if any Senator objects. So they scheduled the hearing for
                    1:30 P.M. The Senate wasn't going to meet until 2:00. The Democrats were still
                    in control at that point. Chris Dodd was Chairman of the Latin American
                    Subcommittee and doing his best to push these appointments through. So when he
                    turned the microphone over to Helms, Helms proceeded to ask Leonard a long
                    series of questions about Nicaragua which consumed the half hour. At the end of
                    the half hour, Dodd said regrettably the Senate is now in session and an
                    objection has been raised to continuing the hearing. Helms said with a smile, “I
                    really regret that because I have a lot of questions that I would like to ask of
                    Mr. Jones, but we have to go now.” That was the end of the hearing or rather the
                    partial hearing. They never got to Phil Hughes at all much less to me.All kinds
                    of people then got involved. The White House went to Senator Dole and tried to
                    get him to blast things loose. Of course Hughes who had been an aide to Bush
                    when he was Vice President was pulling all the strings he had all over town to
                    try to get the nominations brought to the floor. Finally it was made clear that
                    Helms would permit all the nominations to go to the floor except mine. So the
                    decision was made to sacrifice the difficult case and let the others go through.
                    It was a reasonable decision; I would have made the same decision myself. So
                    there we were. The Congress had adjourned. There had in fact been an
                    interruption of Congress during the year and some nominations had to be
                    submitted again that had not been approved. So I was submitted a second time in
                    1990. But here we came to 1991 with the new Congress. If my nomination was going
                    to go forward, it had to be submitted a third time. And of course there was a
                    strong feeling in a number of quarters that this was utterly pointless.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Helms never admitted to anyone that he had any bias against anybody. His real or
                    ostensible reason, your guess is as good as mine, was that he had written to the
                    State Department and asked for copies of all the documents relating to Chile in
                    a certain time period, the end of Pinochet's administration. This was a leftover
                    from the Rodrigo Rojas burning case, and the accusation that Helms leaked
                    information to the Chilean intelligence service. As part of his attempt to clear
                    his name, he had asked for all the documents relating to Chile. The State
                    Department in what I thought was one of its most mistaken moments had written
                    him back that enclosed are all the documents with the exception of two which due
                    to sensitive national security considerations we cannot provide. Of course, that
                    focused his attention on the missing two documents. Why is the State Department
                    withholding these two documents? Why are they denying them? So this was his
                    stated reason for delaying on my nomination. He intended to continue to block my
                    nomination until he was given these documents. The widespread view in the State
                    Department was that this was strictly cover, that he had no intention of letting
                    my nomination go through in any event. It was pointless to let him jerk us
                    through hoops, and dangerous to show him documents. One of them was a memorandum
                    from Assistant Secretary Abrams to the Secretary; the other was an
                    official-informal letter from Ambassador Barnes to the Department, the most
                    private kind of internal correspondence. To reveal this kind of correspondence
                    in a case where the guy wasn't going to get confirmed anyway was idiotic, the
                    argument ran.</p>
                <p>I mean this whole year I felt like I was on a seesaw or a puppet at the end of a
                    string. I had quit the AFSA job in September of '91 because the hearing had been
                    scheduled and it briefly looked like the nomination might go through. So once
                    again ARA had given me a tiny little office on a tiny little obscure corridor. I
                    had a place to sit, but nothing particularly to do. One day I would get word
                    that things were going to get unblocked and were all going to get resolved. The
                    next day there would be word that it was bleaker than ever. And so I was jerked
                    back and forth through all this period. As a result of the Department's internal
                    debate, the nomination was not sent back to the Senate until October. Finally in
                    October as a result of, I don't know what it was a result of, I had pounded and
                    pinged on the system in every way I knew how to, President Bush sent the
                    nomination to the Senate for a third time.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Larry Eagleburger, to his everlasting credit in my eyes, the Deputy Secretary of
                    State, decided he would go personally to see Helms and show him the two
                    documents. Not give them to him, but let him read the documents. From an
                    entirely objective standpoint, I was as outraged as anybody in the building that
                    Helms would have access to this correspondence, but from a personal standpoint,
                    I was delighted that Eagleburger was doing something that might result in
                    breaking my nomination loose. At any rate it was clear that if it failed, then I
                    was finished; there would at least be some conclusion to it. By this point I was
                    anxious to have, to reach closure as they say, in one form or another and not
                    have this go on and on. So he went to see Helms. Helms read the documents, said,
                    “Thank you very much; that's what I wanted.” Eagleburger said,” I would like you
                    to meet with Mr. Jones.” Which was one of the things we had been trying to do
                    for a year and a half, to get me in to see either Helms or a member of his
                    staff. They were impossible; you could not get in to see anybody. They wouldn't
                    return my phone calls, nothing. And Helms said, “Fine. I'd like him to meet with
                    my chief of staff first, and then I would be happy to meet with him.” No
                    reference to Chile. No reference to past complaints about me of any sort. So I
                    met with Jim Lucier, who we learned at that time was just about to be fired as
                    Helms' chief of staff. Admiral Nance was coming in as his replacement. I've
                    always wondered if this had some possible connection, if it was Lucier who bore
                    the great grudge. In fact, Helms' practice has changed from that moment forward.
                    Nance clearly has counseled Helms not to engage in this kind of Mickey Mouse
                    tactic of holding up ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Nance comes from the military too. You do these
                        things and you realize these are not petty games you play I would think. I
                        don't know.</hi>

                <p>JONES: The meeting with Lucier was interesting. Lucier was obviously in an
                    extremely bad mood at having to talk to me at all. He asked what I thought of
                    the situation in Central America. I said I hadn't been involved with Central
                    American affairs for six years but I thought the movement toward peace in El
                    Salvador was encouraging, knowing perfectly well that from his point of view it
                    wasn't encouraging. He didn't want peace in El Salvador until every last commie
                    had been wiped out.</p>

                <p>JONES: Academic, I think. It seems to me that he was a professor of philosophy
                    somewhere. But we got through the meeting and I think the next day I went to see
                    Helms. Nance was with Helms; Lucier was not. Helms, as he normally is when he is
                    dealing with someone directly, was the soul of courtesy. He asked me if I had
                    anything to do with those two documents. By sheer good luck I did not. I would
                    have thought that the odds of picking two documents out of a file of Chilean
                    papers and of my not having anything to do with them were extraordinarily poor.
                    But as it happened, one of them had been written in Washington while I was in
                    Chile, and the other had been written in Chile while I was on home leave. So I
                    could honestly say I did not have anything to do with them. Fortunately, he
                    didn't ask me if I agreed with the two documents. For example, did I agree with
                    Abrams' characterization of Helms in his memo? But he didn't ask. That was all
                    of the interrogation that he had. All of those long questions he said in the
                    hearing he wanted to ask me had somehow disappeared. The perverse came out in
                    me, I said to myself, I am an Ambassador-Designate meeting with a United States
                    Senator, I should do what I think normally should be done in such occasions, so
                    I gave him about five minutes briefing on Guyana which thoroughly glazed his
                    eyes over. No interest whatsoever. We bid farewell very cordially. That was my
                    one and only meeting with Helms. Shortly thereafter, a hearing was scheduled
                    with no difficulty. Now I had an entirely new set of colleagues to go through it
                    with. The Senators present were Dodd and Lugar, who were extremely friendly.
                    Helms did not show up, although Debra DeMoss, Helms' Latin American aide at that
                    time, I met in the hallway outside for the first and only time. I think she came
                    into the hearing room for a few minutes and left.</p>
                <p>Dodd, in spite of his friendliness, asked me a very difficult question. He said,
                    “Is it true that Cheddi Jagan, the leader of the opposition in Guyana, is still
                    a Communist? Is it possible after all these years, he is still a Communist?” In
                    the first place at that point I had no idea and secondly it was almost an
                    impossible question to answer in a hearing where for all I knew there could be
                    some member of the press tucked away somewhere in the rear rows. I stumbled
                    through an answer in some form, and that was it. My and other pending
                    nominations were approved on the day before Thanksgiving 1991, without objection
                    by the Senate. It had been 17 months from the time of my initial nomination—25
                    months from the time I was first asked if I would like to go. But 17 months from
                    the time of nomination to confirmation was and I believe still is the record. In
                    the entire history of the foreign service there have been others who have been
                    held up for comparable or longer periods and never made it. Of those who
                    eventually made it, it took me the longest to get there. I passed Melissa Wells
                    who had been the previous record holder. When I went to tell her that I had
                    seized her record, she said that was a dubious distinction at best.</p>

                        how did it affect you with the family and all this? I would think this thing

                <p>JONES: Well, it did. Also there were some things in our personal life that were
                    happening simultaneously with this. We had to take custody of four small
                    children, three nephews and a niece of my wife's for whom we were the only
                    logical custodians, and they came to live with us in January of '91. So there
                    was a tremendous amount going on in my personal life. I certainly owe my wife a
                    great debt of gratitude for putting up with it all and seeing me through it. But
                    we survived.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well I had to go through all of my briefing in 1990. There was this damned
                    pre-clearance thing. It seemed likely that it was going to go through that year
                    so obviously I had to be prepared, touch all the bases, go around to all the
                    various agencies of the government and find the private companies that had
                    interests in Guyana and so forth. In August of 1990 the Department asked of I
                    would go to the Capstone course at the National War College for about six weeks.
                    It is designed for military officers who are being promoted to general and
                    admiral ranks. They have one place for a foreign service officer who is being
                    promoted to Ambassador in the course. During the course we went to Ottawa and
                    visited the Canadian Government, so I used that visit to consult with the Latin
                    American division of the Canadian Foreign Ministry. All these meetings I had
                    gone through introducing myself as the Ambassador Designate to Guyana. I didn't
                    get there until a year and a half later. My embarrassment was acute; I think
                    there was some embarrassment to the United States. I was sworn in in December of
                    1991, and I arrived in Guyana on January 18, 1992.</p>

                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>JONES: There were some interesting parallels to Chile. Major differences of
                    course, Chile was a much larger country. Certainly relations with Chile under
                    Pinochet loomed much larger in the State Department's eyes than Guyana. But
                    Guyana also had had a long period without a free election. At the time the
                    British were thinking about giving it independence, in the early '60's, the two
                    major political leaders were Cheddi Jagan, a Guyanese of Indian descent who had
                    studied at Howard University and then taken a dental degree from Northwestern
                    University, and Forbes Burnham, a Guyanese of African descent who was a lawyer.
                    While in Chicago, Jagan had met an American, Janet Rosenberg, and married her.
                    Janet, if she wasn't a card-carrying Communist, was the next thing to it and
                    certainly converted Cheddi to Communism. Cheddi returned to Guyana with Janet,
                    went into politics, and won all the elections that were held under the British
                    colonial administration except for the very last one. The British who were
                    initially very reluctant to turn an independent Guyana over to him were clearly
                    coming around to the view that there was no alternative. No matter how many
                    elections they held, he kept winning them. But then Cheddi paid a visit to
                    Washington in '61, I guess, met with Kennedy at the White House, and gave a
                    famous speech at the National Press Club. Kennedy of course was very concerned
                    not to have another Fidel Castro in Latin America, not to have a second Cuba.
                    Although Cheddi said lots of things about wanting good relations with the United
                    States, he didn't give quite the right answers. He wouldn't forthrightly deny
                    that he was a Communist or assure us that he wouldn't have anything to do with
                    the Communists. So the Kennedy administration decided that it should pressure
                    the British to prevent him from coming to power. The Foreign Relations volume
                    with all the documents on this is supposed to be coming out within the next few
                    months. Their publication has been approved.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>The methodology that was eventually arrived at was to change the Constitution to
                    provide for proportional representation instead of first-past-the-post
                    elections. So an election was held on that basis in 1964. There were three
                    forces in Parliament, none of which had a majority: Burnham and Jagan and a
                    smaller conservative pro-business party led by an important businessman. He had
                    the same view as the United States, that at all costs, Jagan must be prevented
                    from coming to power. So he threw his support to Forbes Burnham. Burnham was
                    named prime minister and the British granted independence to Guyana. A number of
                    other things were done as well to help insure Burnham's election. But
                    ironically, after a number of years of getting along well with the United States
                    and Britain, Burnham began turning increasingly toward the Communist Bloc and
                    toward dictatorship and state socialism internally. Something over 80% of the
                    economy was controlled by the government at the time of Burnham's death. My own
                    view is that Jagan could not have possibly been as bad a leader for Guyana as
                    Burnham turned out to be. A spectacular illustration of the risks we run when we
                    try to choose who is best for another country. The uncertainties of that
                    calculus are such that time after time we have been burned, and we were
                    certainly burned in Guyana. We pulled out the Peace Corps, closed down our AID
                    mission. Relations were absolutely at the zero point. Gerald Thomas, Reagan's
                    first Ambassador to Guyana, a political appointee, met with Burnham only once
                    his entire time there, relations were so bad. Burnham died on the operating
                    table under Cuban doctors in 1985 in what was supposed to be a routine
                    operation. They sent his body off to Moscow to be preserved the way Lenin's body
                    was. It was supposed to be viewable in a tomb like Lenin's. Somehow it didn't
                    quite work. The Mausoleum is there but it had to be closed, not for open
                    viewing. Burnham was succeeded by a man named Desmond Hoyte, who was his prime
                    minister. Burnham in the meantime had converted himself from Prime Minister to
                    President, and Hoyte was his Prime Minister and became President on Burnham's
                    death and was confirmed as President in an election held in December of 1985.
                    All of the elections that were held after 1964 were highly suspect. They were
                    not free and fair by any standard. So Hoyte's term of office was supposedly up
                    in 1990, just as I was getting ready to come to Guyana. Hoyte looked at the
                    situation Guyana was in and concluded that the only hope for the country was a
                    180 degree turn. Up to that point, he had been a faithful follower of Burnham's
                    and still talks about him with great affection and nostalgia and so on, but he
                    reversed his policies totally. He began to let foreign investment in. He sold
                    the telephone company to American investors. He cleared up Guyana's arrears to
                    the international lending agencies. He began to give indications that he wanted
                    the 1990 elections to be regarded as free and fair. He told the State
                    Department, I sat in on some of these meetings as Ambassador Designate, that he
                    planned to invite the Commonwealth to send observers to the election. Well, the
                    Commonwealth had observers at previous elections, and they hadn't filed a very
                    credible report, the obvious supposition being that they didn't like having to
                    criticize another Commonwealth member. So the State Department said that's fine
                    but we think you also ought to invite the Carter Center. A bit to everyone's
                    surprise, an invitation was extended to President Carter. Carter went down there
                    in September of 1990 and did the kind of negotiation that only Carter can get
                    away with. He only spent 24 hours in Guyana, but he had done his homework
                    beforehand, and he knew what had to be changed to prevent the election from
                    being stolen once again. It was absolutely clear that whatever Hoyte's
                    intentions were, and there was some doubt about that, it was clear that there
                    were members of his party who had been in power for 26 years and had no
                    intention of giving it up easily. So Carter, just before the end of his visit,
                    and just before a scheduled press conference, told Hoyte that unless Hoyte
                    agreed to do the following things, he was going to announce at the press
                    conference that he was not going to be able to accept the invitation to observe
                    the elections because he couldn't have anything to do with elections that were
                    questionable. So he had Hoyte over a large barrel, and Hoyte agreed to
                    everything that Carter asked. My own view is that Hoyte knew that from the
                    moment he invited Carter, Hoyte was no fool, he didn't know everything he was
                    going to have to concede, but he knew there was a damn good risk that he was
                    going to lose the election, and that he was putting his Presidency on the line
                    by inviting Carter. I think he did it with his eyes open. He did it because he
                    could see no choice for Guyana. So Carter agreed to observe the elections. The
                    various changes that were agreed to began to be implemented, but in best
                    Guyanese fashion with stops and starts and twists and turns. So the elections
                    did not in fact take place in 1990. They still had not taken place when I got
                    there in January of 1992. Hoyte's term just got extended. They wound up being
                    held on October 5, 1992. Which to my private amusement was exactly four years to
                    the day after the plebiscite in Chile in which Pinochet had been defeated. The
                    delays were caused by trying to get a clean voters list and all of the hassles
                    related to that. But we finally got a list that was reasonably accurate. The
                    chairman of the elections commission was changed and an honest man was put in
                    charge of it. The counting of votes had in the past been done according to the
                    British system, at a central counting places. They don't count votes at the
                    place of poll. Carter got Hoyte to agree to count at the place of poll because
                    the big mechanism of fraud had been between the polling place and the counting
                    place, boxes had mysteriously disappeared, and been replaced by others. So my
                    first nine months in Guyana were spent preparing for the elections.</p>

                <p>JONES: There was certainly no difficulty in presenting credentials. The Guyanese
                    were very nice about that. I think I arrived on Saturday, the Foreign Minister
                    received me on Monday, and I presented credentials on Tuesday. When I thanked
                    the Foreign Minister for that very speedy action he smiled and said, “Well we
                    thought you had waited long enough.”</p>

                        political overtone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Certainly the Foreign Minister, Cedric Grant, did. He was in fact
                    simultaneously Ambassador to the United States. In fact I first called on him in
                    Washington in his role as Ambassador. Hoyte had asked him to come back to
                    Guyana. He didn't actually have the title of Foreign Minister because he
                    couldn't be that and Ambassador simultaneously, and he didn't want to give up
                    his Ambassadorship, so they called him special advisor to the President on
                    foreign affairs. He was functioning as Foreign Minister. But it was not terribly
                    easy to see Hoyte or to deal with Hoyte. Hoyte was a very private person to
                    begin with. He had a major tragedy in his personal life. His two daughters were
                    killed in an automobile accident. He was not an easy person to get close to and
                    was very much, both while in the job and out of it, conscious of being
                    President. He wanted all the formalities paid to that status. That is
                    practically the only Guyanese I can say that about. The Guyanese are a very
                    delightful people, very hospitable, and care very little about protocol.</p>
                <p>Jagan received me very warmly. The whole story of Cheddi Jagan is a fascinating
                    one. He bore no resentment toward the United States for having prevented him
                    from becoming Prime Minister. Maybe he did at one time but by the time I got
                    there he certainly bore none. He was an avid listener to the Voice of America.
                    He was always writing in to the VOA commenting on their programs or asking them
                    for more information on something that he had heard on one of their broadcasts.
                    He had heard an interview I had given to VOA after being confirmed. He liked
                    that interview and that got me off to a good start. I asked him the question
                    Senator Dodd had asked me. He replied that he was a Marxist-Leninist, and that
                    he wasn't going to apologize for it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about '92 when Marxism and Leninism was
                        really falling apart in the Motherland and elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>JONES: That was the one and only time I ever talked to him about it. I didn't
                    think it was very productive to rehash the past in terms of accomplishing my
                    mission. But other people, journalists and historians, were always asking him
                    about it. He didn't like to talk about it particularly. He was annoyed that it
                    was brought up with such frequency. But when compelled to talk about it, he
                    would say Communism had never really been properly tried. The Soviet Union had
                    messed it up. Stalin had gotten off on the wrong course so that if you could
                    have true socialism, that would work a lot better than what had been tried in
                    the Soviet Union. But, he would add, this is all irrelevant because this is not
                    the issue of the moment. Guyana certainly needed foreign investment, and he
                    wanted the best possible relations with the United States and with foreign
                    investors. He never apologized; he never retracted anything. In fact I don't
                    think that in his mind he ever changed his views, but he adapted to
                    circumstances. He was enough of a politician to be a pragmatist. He saw clearly
                    that there was no further assistance coming from the Soviet Union, that he had
                    to work with the West. He also saw that the West, not the East, had helped him
                    at long last get back into power. It was the West that was guaranteeing a free
                    election; it was not anybody from Eastern Europe. I think he was really very
                    grateful. He awarded a decoration to Jimmy Carter after he got to be President.
                    He was very grateful for the assistance that the United States in particular had
                    rendered.</p>

                        remember hearing over the years hat she was more red hot red than anybody
                        else and still maintained her American citizenship. I was just wondering
                        what was the feeling at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, both Cheddi and Janet I found charming. I always wondered if I would
                    have found them less charming earlier in their careers when they were both fire
                    brands and when they were not so disposed to be accommodating and neither felt
                    the same gratitude toward the United States nor the same dependency on the
                    United States. But they are certainly very nice people. They are grandparents.
                    Their daughter became a Canadian citizen; their son became a US citizen. Their
                    son was a dentist in New York for about 12 years, came back to Guyana after
                    strong arm-twisting by his parents after his father became President, moved his
                    dental practice to Georgetown. He complained constantly about having to put up
                    with this third world country. He didn't use those words but that was the gist.
                    How he missed the United States and how the United States was the greatest
                    country in the world. I mean the ironies are just profound. Janet had in fact
                    been deprived of her citizenship twice. Once for voting in a foreign election,
                    got it restored, and then taken away again when she was elected to the Guyana
                    legislature, and swore allegiance to Guyana. When Clinton invited Jagan and four
                    other Caribbean leaders to have lunch at the White House in August of '93, his
                    advisor for Latin America, Richard Feinberg, called me and asked me to look into
                    the status of her citizenship and if she still wasn't a citizen, what could we
                    do about restoring it. So I did that and was told that in the light of all the
                    court decisions in the intervening years, she had never voluntarily given it up
                    and therefore it was hers for the asking and she could have it back. I went to
                    see her and laid all this out. She was very nice about it and must have been
                    secretly amused. The American Ambassador coming to see her and offering her her
                    citizenship back. She said she would have to talk to the family, and of course
                    it was difficult now that her husband was President. She never got back to me on
                    it, never took any further steps, so I just kind of let it lie.</p>
                <p>I heard the same thing, that she was the more forceful and committed of the two.
                    I think certainly she must have had the intellectual convictions of Communism.
                    Cheddi was not an intellectual. He was a political leader, a politician. There
                    must have been a time of conversion, but once he was converted I don't think he
                    was as solidly embedded in theoretical marriage to Communist ideas as she was. I
                    don't know whether she would have been as pragmatic as he was. I mean if she had
                    been the Guyanese President, would she have bent as easily with the prevailing
                    winds, I just don't know. There was no visible evidence that she opposed his
                    revisionist policies, his pragmatic course of action.</p>

                        I imagine there was some attention. It obviously wasn't on the front burner
                        but there was some attention. What was your role? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>JONES: We were monitoring the process and reporting on it, trying to do
                    everything that we could to ensure that it would be a free and fair election. I
                    think that everyone who knew anything about Guyana thought that Jagan was the
                    overwhelmingly likely winner for demographic reasons if for nothing else. The
                    East Indian section of the population was the majority, somewhere between 50 and
                    55%. The African descent, 40-45%. The rest were mixed and assorted other
                    ancestors. Everything indicated that the East Indians had a fanatical loyalty to
                    Cheddi and always had. He won his first elective office in Guyana in 1947. By
                    the time of the Bush and Clinton administrations, the shadow or the specter of a
                    second Marxist leader in the hemisphere didn't worry anybody anymore. We no
                    longer had a security concern that Soviet bases would come to be based in
                    Guyana. That was not going to happen in the world of 1990-92. What we wanted to
                    do is keep this process building of converting every country in the Americas to
                    a democracy, for a variety of reasons including the reason that this would
                    isolate Cuba and identify it as the odd man out in the Americas, which it is
                    today. During this first period in Guyana, that was my overwhelming interest.
                    There were little obstacles on the road, but on the whole, all the preparations
                    went well. For the elections in October, a huge number of foreign observers came
                    down. The Carter Center brought 66 observers for the election; the Commonwealth
                    had another 20 or 30 I think, and then there were various other smaller groups
                    that showed up.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>We also had the Deputy Assistant Secretary who was responsible for the Caribbean,
                    Donna Hrinak. On election day she and I visited a polling place, and things were
                    going smoothly; voting was taking place in an orderly fashion. Everything seemed
                    to be going just fine. I was giving a lunch in her honor. Our guests had arrived
                    and we had sat down to lunch. Then the phone rang. There were a couple of
                    Americans who were working at the elections commission. In order to get a clean
                    voters list and an efficient voters list that was computerized, foreign
                    technicians had to be brought in. Actually the UN provided the computer
                    programmers to put the voters list into the computers and set up the computers
                    for receiving the results of the election as well. The senior person was an
                    American named John Gargett. Gargett called me and told me the elections
                    commission was under attack. There was a large crowd outside and they were
                    stoning the building. He was very concerned; they had a couple of policemen
                    there and that was it. They were unarmed, as Guyanese policemen, like the
                    British, normally were. John was very fearful that at any moment the crowd was
                    going to storm the building, run right up the stairs to the computer center and
                    wreck the equipment and threaten the lives of all the foreign programmers
                    including his own. He asked for help. I went to Donna and told her, sorry, I
                    need to get down to the election commissions building. She said I'll go with
                    you, so we piled into the car and headed off to the commission and found
                    conditions exactly as described. There was indeed a sizable crowd outside the
                    door in a very bad mood, as I found out by trying to talk to some of them. In
                    this three story building every pane of glass in it had been shattered. So we
                    worked our way through the crowd and into the building and found the chairman of
                    the commission holding a press conference with mostly foreign press on the
                    ground floor of the building. Gargett and the other technicians were also down
                    there. The press conference broke up, and Gargett and the others said, “get us
                    out of here. This is totally unsafe.” Donna and I led the way out of the
                    building, and just as we came out, the mob began to throw stones again. Some of
                    the glass cut me on the hand and scalp, but we made it out of the building and
                    back to the cars. One of the Commonwealth observers was there, a remarkable lady
                    from New Zealand named Dame Anne Hercus. She said why don't we go see the police
                    commissioner. Some of the cars took the technicians off to the hotel. There was
                    no major problem anywhere except right there in front of the elections building.
                    Dame Anne and Donna and I went off to see the police commissioner, and after
                    some delay got in to see him. He was talking on about four phones at once; there
                    was further delay until he could give us any attention, and in effect made no
                    promises. He said he thought the building had adequate police protection as it
                    was. He did in fact send a few additional policemen to the building. And the
                    technicians, at our urging, went back to the building. Things quieted down. One
                    of the things that happened, the chairman of the elections commission made the
                    very... the complaint of the crowd was that they had not been able to vote.
                    Well, as I had determined by talking to the people, the problem was that they
                    thought all they needed in order to vote was their national identity card. I
                    don't doubt that in past elections that was all they needed. But in 1992 they
                    were supposed to have registered to vote and to be on the voters list. They had
                    not found their names on the list and they were very upset. So the chairman of
                    the elections commission decided to set up a special ballot box and let all
                    these people vote. An absolutely brilliant idea. Their votes were not counted so
                    it was sort of a smoke and mirrors thing, but it got them calmed down and gave
                    them the feeling of satisfaction. So the atmosphere had calmed down and the
                    technicians had gone back to the building.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>But around nightfall I got a call from them again saying there were still just a
                    handful of policemen in front of the center. They could see there was looting
                    going on and people running up and down the street, there were still a
                    considerable number of people outside the building, and they were still very
                    concerned about their safety. Carter had been out of town during the day. He had
                    flown off to the interior to watch the voting, but by this point he was back in
                    town and we briefed him on what had transpired. He went to the elections
                    commissions building, and then picked up the phone and called Hoyte and said,
                    “I'm a former president of the United States and I'm here in this building. I'm
                    not concerned about myself because I have the Secret Service here with me, but I
                    think that if any kind of mob got into this building it would cause very
                    unfortunate press for Guyana.” So Hoyte at that point gave the order and
                    suddenly miraculously, lots of policemen appeared and some army armored
                    personnel carriers were quietly moved into place a few blocks away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: the mob that was outside there were they distinguished as
                        being black as opposed to being Indian or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Of course the population of the city was overwhelmingly black. The
                    East Indian population was overwhelmingly rural. If you had a crowd in
                    Georgetown, the odds are that it would be black. The looting that was going on
                    was looting of Indian stores with Indian names. There is a real racial factor in
                    Guyana. As soon as I heard that Carter had gone to the Commission, I joined him.
                    Later in the evening the British and Canadian High Commissioners cane as well.
                    We stayed there for several hours just to give the technicians some moral
                    support and make sure that nothing further went wrong. In fact nobody ever did
                    enter the building. Who knows why they didn't. I mean they could have easily
                    done so and destroyed everything in the building during almost any point in the
                    day but they didn't. We came within a hair of losing the election, that is, of
                    not having had one. If they would have destroyed the computers it would have
                    been very difficult to have continued with the election. It certainly would have
                    given a perfect excuse to those who didn't want to continue with the election.
                    But the votes were counted. The Carter people did a quick count, a selection of
                    precincts that were representative of the entire vote. Carter went to see Hoyte
                    and Jagan the next morning and told them the results of his quick count showed
                    Jagan ahead by 14 points. The actual vote was 11 points, but Carter said their
                    margin of error was three points, so it was within the margin. So the results
                    were announced; Jagan had won.</p>
                <p>There is a park in Georgetown which has an oval path through it which is fine for
                    jogging or walking. I used to go there and walk every afternoon that I could. I
                    was walking around the path one afternoon a few days later and an Indian lady
                    walked past me in the opposite direction. She went past and just looked at me
                    and said, “Thank you.” A lady that I had never met before and as far as I know
                    never met again. That meant a lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our perspective were there any important changes when
                        Jagan came in? We're talking about really the late '92 up through '95
                        period. Did things change particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, yes. In several contradictory ways. On the one hand, I found access
                    to the President much easier. I found the relationship with the President much
                    easier. I had no trouble getting in to see him and it was always a very relaxed
                    and friendly situation when I did see him. His cabinet was a funny mixture of
                    some very competent people and some much less competent people. There were
                    clearly great debates within the government on just how far to go with this
                    private enterprise nonsense. The election was the high point of my tenure. A
                    very emotional moment, a very satisfying moment to have seen another country
                    through to democracy. There is no question Jagan is going to run an honest
                    election the next time they come up, next year, October of '97. Hoyte had done a
                    lot but he hadn't done everything. The atmosphere in the media was still very
                    controlled when I first arrived. Jagan opened up the media. There was no longer
                    any sense of intimidation or pressure. He gave no indication of having any
                    problem with, well that's a little too strong. There was one occasion when not
                    he himself but his party issued an angry statement about one of the independent
                    newspapers. But on the whole, the whole atmosphere of the country changed to a
                    genuinely free one following the election. So that was very satisfactory. But
                    from that point on the main issue I was concerned with, the main thing the US
                    government wanted me to do during the remainder of my time there, was to try to
                    persuade them to privatize, to get rid of these highly unprofitable government
                    enterprises that were causing their budget deficits, and open the door for
                    foreign investment, in particular American private investment. We were able to
                    restart the AID program. We were able to bring back the Peace Corps. Of course
                    our AID program was tied to compliance with the IMF. The IMF and the IDB and the
                    major Western powers were all trying to get them to privatize. Success in this
                    area was virtually zero. Those remaining two and a half years were on the whole
                    quite frustrating. I had the sense of having a lot of chips that we had won by
                    astutely and honorably playing in the poker game and yet never succeeding in
                    cashing any of them in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that with an Indian population, along
                        with the Chinese and others, these are entrepreneurs from their fingertips.
                        I would have thought that no matter what the proclivities of Jagan and his
                        immediate entourage, he would be dealing with a bunch of small
                        shopkeepers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>JONES: And some of them not so small. There were some very substantial, not
                    substantial in US terms, although there was one family in particular that was
                    substantial even by US standards. The Indians dominated the business community.
                    The blacks were the civil service, the army, the police. The middle class
                    Indians dominated the business community and they had financed Jagan's campaign,
                    plus the communities overseas. One of the remarkable features of Guyanese
                    election campaigns is that both Hoyte and Jagan went off to the US to hold
                    campaign rallies and collect money from Guyanese living in the US and Canada.
                    But in spite of that, the Indian businessmen expressed time and again their
                    frustration at not being able to get through to Jagan. He had all kinds of
                    concerns. He was genuinely worried about the poor. Jagan was somebody, it's hard
                    to say this about a politician, in whom there was hardly a devious bone in his
                    body. What you saw, what you heard from Jagan was it! He was very sincere, I
                    mean the reason he had become a Communist was that he became convinced that was
                    the way to help people, the poor, to raise up the masses. For example, one of
                    the worst run of the government enterprises was the electric company. He was
                    very concerned that if he privatized the electric company, what would happen to
                    the electric rates, people would have to pay more. I and dozens of other people
                    said to him, “Okay, you can skew the rates. You can make the rates high on your
                    Indian businessmen friends and low on the average consumer.” He shot back
                    immediately, ah but the businessmen would simply pass it along and raise their
                    prices in order to make up for their increased electricity costs.</p>
                <p>The second factor was nostalgia and unwillingness to admit error. He had been the
                    one who had nationalized the electric company in the 1950's when he was premier
                    of the colonial government. He just couldn't bring himself to undo that. He is
                    certainly a nationalist if nothing else. That was one issue where he had a lot
                    of black support as well. The idea of foreigners controlling the electric
                    company just stuck in their craw. There were all sorts of schemes for part
                    ownership by local businessmen and part ownership by foreign investors and the
                    state would keep a minority ownership. These ideas were all discussed endlessly
                    and none of them got anywhere. The same thing with the state airline. He would
                    always listen, and his ministers would always listen. They were always extremely
                    polite. I began to be very negative with American businessmen and they would
                    think that I was trying to keep them out of doing business with Guyana, but all
                    I was trying to do was warn them. They would come away glowing from their first
                    meetings. They seemed so interested. They wanted investment. They told us how
                    much they wanted American investment in here and how much that would help the
                    country. Then I would watch it as the weeks went on. Then they would come and
                    see me and say you know you were right. These guys don't really want foreign
                    investment in here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period you were there, did the Cubans play any
                        particular role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>JONES: No. The Cubans still had an embassy there. The Russians, the North
                    Koreans, the Chinese, that was the remnant that was left; I'm told that at one
                    time the place was just inundated with East Germans, Bulgarians, they were all
                    there. The Cuban Ambassador who was there for most of the time I was there was a
                    very friendly sort. The American School even talked us into doing a debate once.
                    Well sort of. It was on separate nights. I thought it wise not to appear on the
                    same platform with a government we didn't recognize so I spoke one night and he
                    spoke the following night. The Cubans had on the whole a very low profile. They
                    did have a group of about 40 doctors there to assist the public health system
                    and some of them would periodically defect. But that was the only aid program
                    they had left. They did very little. Oh, every time something major would happen
                    in US-Cuban relations, he would hold a press conference and condemn us but
                    otherwise played no role. The North Koreans even less. Very little was even seen
                    of the North Koreans even at diplomatic functions. They never did anything
                    publicly. The Russian was a very nice guy, Mikhail Sobolev. We became good
                    friends. Of course by the time I was there they were flying the red white and
                    blue flag, put up on December 31, 1991. He had nothing to play a role with. The
                    Russians and ourselves had built new embassies at the same time. They built a
                    massive structure, a full city block including apartments. And to our great envy
                    a swimming pool and tennis courts. After the change there was no staff to put
                    into this nor any interest in Moscow in having it. They decided not to sell it
                    but instead to lease it to a hotel. A fence was built through the middle of the
                    compound. The swimming pool, tennis courts, and apartments were converted into a
                    hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the tragedy in Jonestown, you know we are talking 20
                        years ago, were there any reverberations from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Not really. The Guyanese, as some of the Latin countries do as well, stole
                    their TV off the satellites. They just downloaded the signal. So we enjoyed a
                    limited amount of American television. Every time that motion picture was shown
                    about Jim Jones, “The Guyana Tragedy,” that got great viewership in Georgetown,
                    the only movie that ever featured Guyana. But it was not something they liked to
                    talk about. Obviously they were mortified that the only thing that most
                    Americans knew about Guyana was “Oh, wasn't that where that crazy guy made
                    everybody drink Kool Aid?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about outside of Georgetown, getting around in Guyana
                        out in the bush or whatever you call it. And also relations with Brazil and
                        Venezuela?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>JONES: Getting around the country was easier than I had expected. There is quite
                    a good paved road that runs from Georgetown, which in the middle of the Atlantic
                    coast, all the way to the eastern border with Suriname. The same road makes a 90
                    degree turn and goes south from Georgetown about 30 miles to a bauxite mining
                    town called Linden. (Linden Forbes Burnham named it after himself.) The American
                    and Canadian bauxite companies were another thing that were nationalized, by
                    Burnham in that case. Those were essentially the only paved roads in the
                    country, that one road with its 90 degree turn. So you could travel quite easily
                    along to coast and to Linden by car. Beyond that you really had to have a four
                    wheel drive vehicle and you could drive over unpaved roads for further
                    distances. There were many rivers, and you could go up them by boat, or you
                    could fly. As in many of the Latin countries, there are small landing strips all
                    over the place and lots of small private planes around. Not at all difficult to
                    get yourself a ride into the interior. Anywhere there was any significant
                    economic activity, there were people flying in in small planes, because that was
                    the only time-effective way to get in. The interior is quite beautiful. The
                    interior is a subsection of the Amazon rain forest and as the Amazon rain forest
                    is burnt off and chopped down, the Guyana portion of it is one of the last
                    unspoiled virgin rain forests in the world. Another thing I tried to do and kept
                    being frustrated about was to get some kind of interest shown by the US
                    Government and non-governmental organizations in the Guyanese rain forest. Again
                    highly frustrating and no real success. The World Wildlife Fund was very
                    interested at the time I was first going down to Guyana, but their condition of
                    cooperation with Guyana, was for Guyana's one national park to be expanded
                    substantially, increased about ten times in size in order to provide some legal
                    basis for protection. They told the Guyanese that if they would take that step,
                    the World Wildlife Fund would go out and raise funds for Guyana worldwide, and
                    give it a lot of publicity as a country courageously protecting its environment.
                    But the Guyanese would never take that step. Neither the Hoyte nor the Jagan
                    administrations were willing to, basically because they weren't willing to close
                    the door permanently to development of that large an area. In any developing
                    country the dilemma is a severe one. They want to protect the environment, but
                    they also want development. The United States and other industrialized countries
                    didn't protect the environment when they were developing, why should they? As
                    they saw it, they were now being asked to do the things we were unwilling to do
                    when we were going through the developmental phase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, maybe we are coming to the end here. Things can be
                        added on. I take it you got your election and everything was fine and then
                        you began tilting at these windmills.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>JONES: The windmills of privatization. The one political issue that came up after
                    the election, they had another election incidentally, municipal elections in
                    '94, which ran very smoothly with much less furor and tension. In the political
                    area the only other issue that required major attention was getting Guyanese
                    support for our objectives in Haiti. Which was originally trying to get them to
                    take Haitian refugees. A lot of major efforts were made. I made efforts with
                    Jagan, leaned on him harder than on any other issue the whole time I knew him. I
                    got what I told the Department was as close as Jagan ever came to saying no.
                    What he said was “the boys in the party are not enthusiastic about this.” I told
                    the Department, you should read that as this is not going to happen. Then he
                    went off to a conference in Barbados, and the Department sent its top Haitian
                    people down to this conference at least in part to work on Jagan. Bill Grey, the
                    President's special advisor on Haiti, Jim Dobbins and various people, I'm told
                    met with him for five hours. An extraordinary example of Jagan's patience and
                    good will that he devoted that much time to a group of people that he knew he
                    was going to say no to in the end anyway. They got nowhere with him. They got a
                    yes from Suriname and in fact we moved in military engineers and built a big
                    camp in Suriname. Then just as we got it built the need for housing refugees
                    disappeared because we made the decision that we were going to go in to
                    Haiti.</p>
                <p>So then instructions came out for the new pitch. The new pitch was that we wanted
                    Caribbean participation in the multinational force. The Guyanese had been very
                    nervous, an Indian government was nervous about taking black refugees, but they
                    were quite prepared to participate in a UN force in Haiti, but then we made it
                    clear that what we were asking them to do was to participate in a US-led force
                    which was going to be the precursor to the UN force. Because the reality was the
                    UN would not come in until someone else had made things safer. That gave them
                    considerable pause, and again I had to work very hard on Jagan and the Foreign
                    Minister. It was a close thing. I think Guyana was the last of the Caribbean
                    countries to come aboard, but they did finally agree to participate. At any one
                    time they had about 50 Guyanese in Haiti. All things considered, given their
                    history of total non-cooperation with the US in foreign policy matters, it was a
                    big step forward in US-Guyanese relations, and I was proud of my part in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you retired in '95?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I did some soundings as I suspect everyone does as to whether there
                    might be another chief of mission assignment. There were no indications that one
                    would be forthcoming. So I put in my retirement papers and planned to retire
                    after leaving Guyana in August of '95. But then the Department called up and
                    twisted my arm to go up to New York and be the Latin American advisor to the UN
                    delegation. So I did that from September to December and then retired the last
                    day of the year 1995.</p>
