                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 18, 1989</p>

                <p>[Note: Ambassador Wiley did not edit this interview]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, give us a little of your background. How
                        did you become interested in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I came to the profession a little later than many of my colleagues. I was
                    over 30 when I went to the Middle East for the State University of New York,
                    which was conducting some aid activities under contract, in what was then called
                    USOM, the predecessor of the aid mission. While there, I became rather
                    interested in the problems of the Middle East and foreign affairs in general. So
                    I took the exams out there in the Middle East, both the written and the oral
                    exams. I passed them and came into the Foreign Service when I was about 33 years
                    old, I guess. Since I had had some experience in the Middle East, I was assigned
                    Arabic language in area training, and became involved in the Middle East from
                    that point on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing when you were working for
                        the university? You said it was aid-style work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I was deputy chief of the aid group that was sent out by the State
                    University of New York, and I handled all the administrative aspects of the
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Recruiting, handling the payrolls, the finances, etc. The work was
                    across-the-board technical assistance in various economic activities, such as
                    agriculture and industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What countries were you particularly involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WILEY: My first experience out there was in Israel, when I went out with the
                    group from the State University of New York. I took the written exam in Israel,
                    and I took the oral exam in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment when you came in 1958 into the
                        Foreign Service was going to Taiz. I get confused over the Yemens. Where
                        does Taiz fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Taiz is in north Yemen. That was back in the days of the old ruler, who
                    kept the country quite isolated. My visa that I received to go into the—what was
                    then the legation. It was something like the 67th visa that had ever been issued
                    for north Yemen. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was doing work—on the reverse, at the other end. I was
                        in Dhahran issuing visas to Yemenis going to Lackawanna, New York and
                        Youngstown, Ohio. Could you describe a little of what Taiz was like at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was the Imam that ruled the country. He moved around frequently from
                    Taiz up to Sanaa or down to Hodeida. He was very suspicious that there were
                    going to be coups organized against him—which, of course, there was a year or
                    two later. Taiz in those days was very much like a city out of the Middle Ages.
                    They locked the gates at sundown and didn't open them again until the next
                    morning. It was an experience of, literally, going back and living in the Middle
                    Ages. There was no water, except what you could go and hire coolies to dredge
                    out of a muddy pond near Taiz into large containers that you then took back and
                    pumped up to the roof tanks in your building. There was no electricity, except
                    for a small generator that an Italian had set up strictly as a private
                    enterprise. He would sell you a connection up to the generator which he only ran
                    at night. He didn't run it in the daytime. So for a refrigerator, you had to use
                    a kerosene burner type of refrigerator, which was always smoking and the wicks
                    burning out. [Laughter] So everyday living was something of a problem at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a mission did we have there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: In those days when I first went there was just two officers, Bill
                    S(Inaudible) was the charge, and I was his assistant in practically everything.
                    The way it worked out, Bill did the critical reporting, and I did practically
                    everything else, including the administrative side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest in the Yemen at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILEY: The major reason that we had opened an office there was our concern over
                    the penetration of Communist China into the Yemen. They had come in and offered
                    some rather substantial assistance to North Yemen, in the way of road projects
                    and other economic assistance. This, of course, caused a number of eyebrows to
                    rise back in Washington, and we thought that we ought to have some diplomatic
                    representation there as well.</p>
                <p>So the office was originally manned out of Aden. Then, later, it became fully
                    resident, although, for awhile, it was under the ambassador in Cairo. By the
                    time I got there, there was an independent charg� d'affaires. Then I was the
                    number two man, although it was still not an embassy. At that point, it was a
                    legation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the penetration of—for want of a
                        better word—Nasserism there? It certainly was a factor in other parts of the
                        Arab world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: This was in the late '50s. We were concerned about Nasserism, particularly
                    in places like Aden, which was strategically considered quite important in those
                    days. But then, at that stage, it was still a British colony. The British were
                    concerned about possible subversion from Nasserite elements in Aden. Yemen
                    Proper there was—that is, by Yemen proper I mean North Yemen, where I was—there
                    was not much Nasserite penetration at the stage that I was there, because the
                    population was pretty isolated, largely illiterate, and had very little contact
                    with the outside world, including the more radical forces in the Arab world at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For one thing, one of the concerns was the spreading out
                        of Palestinians, who were considered to be the bringers of Nasserism at that
                        point, if I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: There were almost no Palestinians in North Yemen. They were not permitted
                    in the country. Just about the only foreigners there were a few Italians, who
                    had established kind of a beachhead there when they were across the Red Sea in
                    Eritrea. But even the Italians had very small numbers present there, a few
                    doctors that were in the country operating very primitive equipment. Then the
                    Chinese made this move, in which they offered a lot of assistance to the Yemen,
                    and were able to bring in a number of workers who were working on roads and so
                    on, which is when we became more concerned about possible communist penetration
                    of the country, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at the Chinese effort there, this was
                        certainly a wide jump from where they were, without sort of a Navy, or Air
                        Force, or anything to support it. Looking at our assumption at the time, did
                        we—was it borne out that this really a real danger, or was this just a sort
                        of a peculiar Chinese effort which was doomed to failure, if it meant to
                        have any political influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILEY: Well, this was the late '50s, if you remember, when the Cold War was
                    pretty much at its height. We were worried about any apparent increase in
                    communist influence anyplace in the Middle East in those days. It was true that
                    the Chinese capability was fairly limited. They certainly had no Navy or Air
                    Force. They were definitely not a military threat to the region. I think we were
                    more concerned about possible subversive activity. The Chinese, there, could
                    have linked up with more radical indigenous elements and attempted to overthrow
                    the regime, in order to establish a regime more sympathetic to them, which is
                    basically what happened down in Aden, of course, in the southern unit later on.
                    South Yemen is still very much dominated by the Soviet Union these days. We were
                    concerned about the possible subversive efforts against the Imam, who was not
                    all that popular at that time in North Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our view of the Imam, or how did you see him at
                        the time? Did you have any dealings with him? What type of person was he?
                        How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: My boss saw him a few times. I didn't see him directly. He was a rather
                    reclusive individual. He kept to his palaces with a few of his friends and
                    concubines around him. He did not appear in public very often. He kept a very
                    autocratic kind of regime. He was quite capable of executing people who showed
                    any opposition to the regime and did so publicly from time to time. But he did
                    not have a broad base of support, except in certain of the traditional elements
                    among the tribes, who had traditionally supported his tribe or his family. It
                    was only a year or so later that the Egyptians overthrew him in a coup d'�tat,
                    and his son came into power briefly and then he was expelled in turn. Then that
                    started the long civil war that went on in North Yemen between the Egyptians,
                    who sent in troops, and the Yemen army, the indigenous army who opposed
                    Egyptians, whom they considered invaders, and eventually the Egyptians were
                    forced to leave the country as you know. But it was mainly the Egyptians who
                    organized the coup d'�tat that did overthrow the Imam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, were we watching the Egyptians rather
                        closely? Were we concerned at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think in that period we were rather concerned about the way Nasserism
                    was spreading all through the lower gulf, and in the Yemens, etc. I don't think
                    North Yemen was all that much of a strategic hot point for us. Nevertheless, we
                    were concerned about it, more, I think, because of its relationship to Aden,
                    which, at that point, was considered the more strategic port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about oil? Were we thinking in terms of oil there at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WILEY: There was some exploration going on. John Meekum (phonetic) came in when I
                    was there and did some exploration, but then he was unsuccessful and he left
                    again. Subsequently, there, they have been more successful and there is some oil
                    now being produced in the Yemen. But it was never considered to be a major
                    potential for oil there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we weren't thinking in terms of oil reserves there, or
                        something. We were more concerned about its strategic location.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think, yes, in those days we were more worried about Aden, and we were
                    worried about the lower gulf, that were rich in oil, and the possibility that
                    our adversaries internationally could use Yemen as kind of a bridgehead to then
                    move into these other countries that were more strategically important than
                    North Yemen was. And also about Saudi Arabia, because they had always had a
                    rather special relationship with North Yemen, and they still consider North
                    Yemen to be kind of within their sphere of influence. Of course, our interests
                    in Saudi Arabia were much greater because of the oil reserves in Saudi
                    Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went into language training. Was this your choice, or
                        were you sort of tabbed and said go, or how did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: No, by this point I was quite interested in the Middle East, and I
                    volunteered for the Language-in-Area program in Arabic in Beirut, Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Historians, who I hope will be looking at this record in
                        later years, are always very interested in, what you might call, the making
                        of an Arabist. Looking at your class and those around you, was there a type
                        that went into Arabic studies, or how would you describe the group that you
                        went in with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We had, in those days, fairly large classes going through the program.
                    Very few of them are still left in the Foreign Service these days, but a few of
                    the old hands are still around. I think, back in the late '50s, the Middle East
                    had become more important to us because of the growing importance of the oil
                    reserves. This was still the era of fairly cheap oil, but our imports from the
                    Middle East were rising quite rapidly, and it was becoming obvious that it was
                    going to be an important source of energy of the future.</p>

                <p>Most of the fellows that went into Arabic—not most of them, but some of
                    them—actually had some experience in the Middle East previous to coming into the
                    Foreign Service. They had been sons of teachers or missionaries who had lived in
                    the Middle East and things like that, and they knew some of the language
                    already. Others of us were just interested in the area, primarily, because of
                    its politics and because of the archeology in the historic connections of the
                    Middle East. I think a number of the Arabists were people who did have some
                    historical interest in the area, and because of the cultural interest that many
                    of us had in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, would you say there was a factor, too, that, at that
                        particular time, there was a feeling that it was best to concentrate in an
                        area for career advancement, and the Arab world looked like a fairly good
                        place to stake out your claim?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think there was some feeling to that effect. Particularly, if you were
                    interested in the political side—and in those days, the political side of the
                    Foreign Service were the elite. It was the best way to get to the
                    ambassadorships, to come up through the political ranks, of course. I think the
                    Middle East was very attractive for someone who was interested in the political
                    aspects. I always said the Middle East was probably the most interesting part of
                    the world for diplomats and journalists. I think it probably still is, in many
                    ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another thing, too, is that ambassadorial assignments and
                        all did not go to political appointees, but mainly went to those who were in
                        the professional service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Generally speaking, that was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the view of Israel? Again, one of the charges
                        made often is Arabists are basically anti-Israeli. What was the view of
                        Israel? You were in Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I have yet to see any of my Arabist colleagues show any anti-Semitic
                    leanings of any kind. They have all been very intelligent, with no racial biases
                    or religious biases that I have been able to detect. Someone who volunteers to
                    spend a good part of their life in the Middle East, is probably not someone with
                    strong ethnic biases to begin with, or you wouldn't volunteer for this. Although
                    I think the Arabists have been accused of being anti-Israeli, I think this is
                    certainly not true, in the sense that they had any inherent anti-Jewish or
                    anti-Semitic bias. Obviously, the Arabs are Semites, too. If they are
                    volunteering to spend their lives with the Arabs, they are, obviously, not
                    anti-Semitic. I think that is a bum rap, in so far as that has been applied to
                    Arabists, as it has been, sometimes, rather irresponsibly.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I think, as a result of our experiences in the Middle East, many of us ended up
                    being pretty unhappy at the way the policy decisions were made in Washington. We
                    did feel that the Israeli lobby had too much influence in terms of U.S. national
                    interest, and that our elected political leadership was influenced by the
                    domestic political factors to a greater degree than what we viewed as our
                    long-term interest in the Middle East. I think that is probably still true of
                    our political situation, because of the strength of the Israeli lobby here in
                    the United States. The Arabists were constantly in a position in which they were
                    giving their honest judgment that a certain course of action was in the United
                    States interest, which was opposed by the Israeli lobby back here, who had other
                    interests as they saw it, in terms of their relationship with Israel.</p>
                <p>So there was this built in tension, and, to some extent, I suspect this is always
                    a problem between a career service, who are trained primarily to look at long
                    term U.S. interests, as opposed to elected officials, who are focusing primarily
                    on the next election. So there is always this built in tension between the two,
                    and this was particularly acute in the case of the Middle East and Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '58, this was already a feeling there. What were the
                        U.S. long-term interests? Because things keep changing all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: In '58, the Israeli lobby didn't have near the clout it has now. In fact,
                    we didn't start selling weapons to Israel until the '60s, it was after that
                    period. We were not an arms support of Israel, when I first came in the Foreign
                    Service, and got involved in Middle East problems. That all started at a later
                    date.</p>
                <p>The Israeli lobby tightened its control over the U.S. Congress considerably over
                    the years. In those days, they didn't have anything like the control they have
                    now on Middle East matters in the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were language-trained from '61 to '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Jordan, where you were an economic
                        officer from '63 to '65? What type of work were you doing there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WILEY: In Jordan I was the economic officer in the embassy. We had a fairly
                    substantial aid program going with Jordan in those days, including a rather
                    large straight cash subsidy as well as a large technical assistance program. So,
                    my job was really to analyze the nature of the economy of Jordan, report on it,
                    and to make recommendations to my superiors about the nature of our aid program.
                    I used to attend all the meetings of the aid mission as well as the embassy
                    meetings, I mean the staff meetings of the aid mission. We also had a relatively
                    small amount of commercial relations with Jordan, largely aid finance that I
                    became involved in, promoting our commercial relations in Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador then was Robert Barnes, I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Barnes came after I was there. Butts Macomber was ambassador when I first
                    arrived, and then Barnes came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Macomber is sort of a major figure in American
                        Foreign Service. Could you describe a bit about his method of
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I always got along, I think, quite well with Ambassador Macomber. He was
                    not a career Foreign Service Officer. He had come in via the Congress, where he
                    had been a staffer, and then, from there, went into the executive branch. So he
                    was essentially a political appointee, but he had a strong feeling for the
                    Service. He had been in the Marine Corps in World War II, and was oriented in
                    terms of career services and developing career services. I think he felt
                    strongly about that, and still does. He didn't have the kind of background that
                    a lot of Foreign Service Officers would have, in that, he didn't come up through
                    the ranks of the Foreign Service. He came in as an ambassador. But he was
                    certainly not the typical political appointee either, who was there because he
                    was a fund raiser. He was there because he did know a lot about the area, and
                    because he knew how the political system in the Congress and the Executive
                    Branch worked back here. As I say, I didn't have any problems with him. I always
                    found him very devoted to his job, worked very hard, and had a very sincere
                    interest in the United States interests in that part of the world, and took his
                    job very seriously.</p>

                        take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, and reporting on the overall economic condition of the country.</p>

                        puzzle of the Middle East. How effective was the aid program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILEY: The country was very poor. Jordan doesn't have the natural resources or
                    the oil of rich states, of course. They have a relatively well-educated
                    population, and, in fact, a lot of Jordanians—in fact, more than half the
                    country were Palestinians, when I was there, a lot of them refugees, of course.
                    But a lot of them were professional people, businessmen, bankers, etc. as
                    well.</p>
                <p>Later on, many of the Palestinians went on to jobs in the gulf in Saudi Arabia
                    and the oil rich countries, and sent back remittances, which became a very
                    important part of the economy. That hadn't really started when I was there. That
                    was just beginning at that stage. They did have this large refugee population,
                    which was supported primarily through UNWRA, the U.N. agency. And the U.N.
                    agency was funded, a substantial part of it, by the United States Government. So
                    we were, either through the aid program directly, or through UNWRA, providing an
                    awful lot of the economic support for the country.</p>
                <p>Their resources were quite limited in terms of what they could do for themselves.
                    Agriculture is limited by the lack of water. They don't have oil. They have
                    developed a pretty strong service industry, which at that stage was only getting
                    under way for that part of the world. They were helped, considerably, later on
                    by the problems of Beirut, because a lot of companies that had regional offices
                    in Beirut moved to Amman. That provided an in-flow of capital into Amman. That
                    did help them a lot later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Amman when you were
                        there? We're talking about '63 to '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: The king had gone through kind of a difficult period before I got there,
                    when there were some riots and demonstrations against the king. He was still a
                    little defensive, I would say, from that period. He always had a delicate
                    balance to maintain of being an East banker. Actually, his family are from the
                    Hejaz in Saudi Arabia. In a population that was more than half Palestinian in
                    those days, many of them did not like the idea of having a king who came from
                    the bedouin elements of the population, where as they considered themselves more
                    sophisticated and advanced city dwellers, which a lot of the Palestinians were,
                    of course.</p>
                <p>So you always had to be pretty careful about Palestinian sensitivities. Of
                    course, in those days he also had sovereignty over the West Bank, and the old
                    city of Jerusalem which they lost then in the '67 War, when Israel occupied the
                    West Bank in Jerusalem. But he had that large Palestinian population on the West
                    Bank, as well, then under his sovereignty. So it was kind of a difficult
                    political task, but he was fairly adept, I think, at balancing off the pressures
                    upon him, and handling a delicate political situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the embassy feel about him as a person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think, generally speaking, the embassy was fairly impressed at his
                    political skills. He was still quite young when I was there. He was always, at
                    least, acceptable to the Israelis. The Israelis preferred to see the Hashemite
                    regime in Jordan, than to one of the more radical Arab regimes taking over the
                    place. So they never made any particular trouble for Jordan, except on some of
                    the arms sales problems. The economic aid to Jordan didn't bother the Israeli
                    lobby. The Israeli lobby did become quite vocal over arms sales, and that did
                    get to be a period of real political struggle back then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in any of that while you were there, or
                        did that come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Most of it came later, I was involved in some of the first aircraft sales
                    to Jordan. At that point, the Israeli lobby was not as well organized as it
                    became later on, and it didn't put up any effective opposition to the initial
                    round. Although there was opposition in the Executive Branch in those days
                    because, the simple reason, they didn't think Jordan could afford the more
                    sophisticated weapons, and it would really be funded at our expense, which it
                    was, largely, of course. They didn't see any particular reason for the king to
                    have the more sophisticated weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At your level, or at the ambassadorial level that you are
                        aware of, was there much consultation between our embassy and Tel Aviv and
                        in Amman, or did you each go your own way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: There was a fair amount of consultation. There was a certain amount of
                    visiting back and forth in those days. You could go up to the old city, and you
                    had to walk across the Mandelbaum Gate, which you could do and visit the other
                    side for a few days, and then come back. I went over to Israel several times
                    while I was in Amman. I think, probably, there was more visitation from Jordan
                    into Israel, than there were from the embassy in Israel going into Jordan,
                    except maybe to the old city to see some of the sites there. Certainly, there
                    was a pretty wide distribution of communications between the two. We saw most of
                    their telegrams. They saw most of ours, and airgrams etc.</p>

                <p>WILEY: Yes, it was until '57, and I was gone by then. There was, I think, some
                    tendency, particularly, on the part of the ambassadors in Israel, who were not
                    Arabist, who didn't have a broad experience in the Middle East to become
                    convinced of the Israeli point of view and to push it very vigorously back in
                    Washington, which used to annoy the ambassadors in the Arab countries around the
                    area, of course. That tension always did go on.</p>

                <p>WILEY: I was a desk officer for Jordan and Iraq when I came back. And it was on

                        it, and what did you do?</hi>

                <p>WILEY: How did I hear about the war?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this come at you? Were you ready for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We were a little surprised when the war finally broke out. Obviously, the
                    tensions had been building. And the Arabists had been saying for a long time
                    that there has to be some kind of a settlement to this problem, or there is
                    going to be an explosion. It was hard to predict just when the explosion was
                    going to take place, of course. When it came about in '67, Jordan made the
                    mistake of listening to Nasser, who talked him into joining into the war, of
                    course, for which he paid a heavy price in losing the West Bank, which he has
                    still lost, and has still now pretty much renounced any claim at all to the West
                    Bank. In that period leading up to the war, I think, there was a lot of concern
                    at the working level that our policies were not sufficiently vigorous in
                    pursuing peace initiatives. Particularly, we were never very effective in
                    working with the Israelis to try to get them to make an accommodation that would
                    some how be acceptable to the Palestinians, which we still aren't very good at
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're on the Iraqi-Jordanian desk. War comes out, I mean
                        the Israelis. Nasser called for the U.N. to depart. The Israelis have the
                        air strikes. Jordan came in. Were we doing anything, as far as King Hussein
                        was concerned, saying, “For God's sake, don't get in this thing. You're
                        going to lose your shirt,” which he did? Do you know that we were involved
                        in that, or did it just happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WILEY: I think this happened very quickly. The king was largely convinced as a
                    result of a telephone call or two from Nasser, that he better join in on the
                    first day. We, as far as I know, did not have an opportunity to make any
                    representations to the king about this before he made up his mind. He acted very
                    quickly based on conversations with Gamal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a desk officer do, when one of the countries
                        you're in goes to war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: He doesn't sleep much for one thing. [Laughter] He spends a lot of time in
                    the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You see, these interviews are designed for people who are
                        not overly familiar with what happens in the State Department. So I would
                        like to get a little feel for what you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: The desk officer, of course, gets immediately deluged by people wanting to
                    know about relatives or family members, who are in the war zone. There were some
                    construction companies working in Jordan in the West Bank, for instance, who
                    were then overrun by the Israeli forces—American construction companies. They
                    were not only worried about their personnel. They were also worried about their
                    equipment, this kind of thing, that they had there in the war zone. Of course,
                    they all immediately came charging into the desk officer wanting to know what
                    the situation is, and wanting help in getting their stuff out, and getting their
                    people out.</p>
                <p>So that takes a lot of time. Then, of course, you're getting pressure from your
                    bosses to write position papers on what our policy ought to be—to talking points
                    when we're calling in the Jordanian ambassador to talk to him or the Iraqi
                    ambassador whoever. The assistant secretary will want talking points prepared by
                    the desk officer to help him set up a line that you take with the ambassador as
                    to what we're advising the country to do, or whatever representations we want to
                    make to the country at that point. And there are usually other kinds of think
                    pieces that go to a higher level, and perhaps even go to the President, about
                    what we should do as a result of these events. Should we put pressure on the
                    Israelis to withdraw? Do we not pressure the Israelis, let them sit in the
                    occupied territories in hopes of bringing the Arabs into a more accommodating
                    stance in negotiations? If we put pressure on the Israelis is this going to lead
                    to a situation in the future in which the Arabs will feel freer to start
                    hostilities? What's happening at the U.N.? What are we telling our ambassador at
                    the U.N. to say in the Security Council meetings? The desk officer gets involved
                    in all of this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I was generally pushing the line that we should be putting more pressure
                    on the Israelis to withdraw. After all, they had started the thing by their
                    sudden strikes on the Egyptian air fields in beginning the war. I thought that
                    we would have been in a much better situation as far as future negotiations, if
                    we had asked the Israelis to withdraw, as we had in previous occasions when
                    Israel had crossed the border on raids aimed at Palestinian concentrations, and
                    so on. I thought we should have done it then, and I think probably I had
                    support, at least up through the assistant secretary.</p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: The Secretary and the Under Secretary, and the White House, of course,
                    where the final decisions were made, of course. Johnson was quite close to the
                    Israelis, and he refused to put any pressure on Israel at all about their
                    occupation in the occupied territories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One can say one is close to the Israelis, and looking at
                        this as a retired Foreign Service Officer, it's difficult to see what vital
                        interest we have in Israel. Is this purely a political matter, being the
                        Israeli lobby, which often is translated as being the Jewish voter, as sort
                        of a rather cohesive body? Is it purely political, or is there another
                        reason that you can see for such strong support of Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: In my view, it is strictly a reaction to the strength of the domestic
                    lobby, the Israeli lobby. The argument that Israel is a strategic asset to the
                    United States, is essentially a rationalization for the domestic political
                    pressures, because, in fact, they're not an asset, they're a liability. Our
                    relationship with Israel has gotten in the way of much more important strategic
                    relationships that we should have with Saudi Arabia, with the gulf countries,
                    where our real interests lie in the populations, and in the wealth of the area,
                    which is in the oil fields, primarily. Israel is only about 2 percent of the
                    population, and because of our support for that 2 percent, we're willing to
                    alienate the good will of the other 98 percent, which have most of the land area
                    and most of the resources, which, I think, in terms of our national interest, is
                    a mistake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any pressure on you to tailor your
                        recommendations to, you might say, the domestic political realities, or did
                        you feel you could call it as it was, and then sit back and watch any
                        recommendations go down the tubes, because of domestic politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think as a junior officer, I felt fairly free in giving my
                    recommendations. Now there is a limit in how far they would go. They may not get
                    past the assistant secretary, who I think, personally, was probably sympathetic
                    to what I was saying, but who had to be a little more in tune with the political
                    realities here, than I had to be. I think as a junior officer, I was free to
                    call the shots as I saw them. The higher you get up the ladder, the more
                    difficult that becomes. An ambassador, for instance, has to be more careful
                    about this kind of thing. I think many ambassadors do feel that they have to be
                    careful in their recommendations. They can't always say exactly what they
                    believe because of the political realities back here on the domestic side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This waxes and wanes, but did you feel at the time that
                        dealing with Middle Eastern affairs— very sensitive Middle Eastern
                        affairs—that recommendations you made would immediately be leaked to
                        Congress? Did you feel comfortable at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think, as a junior officer, I didn't worry too much about that, because
                    no one paid that much attention to what I was saying, in any case. [Laughter] I
                    wasn't that important that the Israeli lobby was going to single me out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that is sometimes forgotten. It really
                        didn't make any difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Exactly, yes. Within the Bureau, there has always been a very healthy
                    relationship, in the sense that the people knew and trusted each other and
                    really expected the other person to give honest judgments and honest opinions. I
                    think the Middle East Bureau has always been very good for that. The Arabists, I
                    think, are an unusually honorable group of people and always have been in this
                    sense, and have really been concerned about the national interests of the United
                    States, and consistently opposed the Israeli lobby, when they thought the
                    Israeli lobby positions were contrary to those interests, which is why they are
                    still very unpopular with the Israeli lobby, of course. I think they're a very
                    decent, very honorable bunch of people, and supplied my bosses for the next two
                    or three levels up. So I was, in a sense, shielded from the political problems
                    by this being far enough down the ladder, that no one cared that much about what
                    I was saying.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILEY: Iraq was going through a pretty difficult period in those days. After the
                    overthrow of the Nuri al-Said regime back in '57, the country really went
                    through quite an unstable period. The Baath party took over briefly in '63, and
                    then they were in power only about nine months before they were kicked out
                    again. Then there were various military dictatorships that ran the country,
                    until the Baath party came back in '67, and at that time managed to hang on to
                    control, and they are still in power now. But from '57 to '67, the country was
                    very unstable with a series of coups and coup attempts, until the Baath party
                    consolidated its power in '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing much then, or did we have representation
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Oh, sure, we had an embassy, a rather big embassy, in fact, until the '67
                    War, when relations were broken. We had a fairly substantial aid mission up
                    until '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Iraq at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: There were some substantial reserves of oil that we were aware of, even
                    then, although they have since proven to be much greater than we had realized at
                    the time. And it's one of the larger countries of the Middle East. It has a
                    population now of about 16 million or so, a little less in those days, of
                    course. It was potentially a fairly wealthy country. It had water. It had oil.
                    It had a relatively well-educated population in terms of an infrastructure which
                    the Baath party has done a lot to build, incidentally, since they have gotten
                    into office, for which they were starting on in those days. It had a relatively
                    key geographic position there in controlling the river valley, the Tigris and
                    Euphrates. It was a player in the Arab and Israel situation, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Iraq fit into the Israeli equation? Again we're
                        talking about the '65 to '68 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: When the Baath party consolidated its control over the country, I think it
                    attempted to use the Israeli issue as a means of exerting some leadership in the
                    Arab world. You see, the Baath party does not have aspirations limited to Iraq.
                    It was a Pan-Arab party, and they had Baath parties in various Arab countries,
                    although it is only in Iraq and in Syria where they succeeded in taking power.
                    But they had parties in places like Jordan and even in Saudi Arabia and the gulf
                    states, the Yemen, there is a Baath party there.</p>
                <p>They saw the Arab-Israeli issue as a means of promoting themselves in the
                    Pan-Arab contacts, by becoming more outspoken against the Israelis than other
                    countries were. So they talked a very hard line. They, for a long time,
                    maintained very cool relations with the U.S., as part of that policy, because of
                    our support for Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>After the '67 War, they were one of the last countries to finally resume
                    diplomatic relations with the United States, you know, although we had
                    intersections in each other's countries for a long time. But the one reason that
                    they were cool to the U.S. was that they were trying to make the point to the
                    other Arabs that they were stronger anti-Israelis than the other Arabs were. I
                    think that may have changed now as a result of the war. They found out, I think
                    during the war, that it was important not to be too isolated in this world, as
                    they had been prior to the war.</p>

                <p>WILEY: It started in 1980 and just finished in '88, about an eight-year war. So
                    the Iraqis always did try to ride that issue. At the same time, they didn't
                    actively do much about it. They did have some terrorist groups working out of
                    Iraq. Abdul Nidal was held up there for quite a while. Finally, they expelled
                    Abdul Nidal.</p>

                <p>WILEY: Yes, they did expel him finally. But they told us, when they expelled him,
                    “This isn't going to help you very much because, when he was here in Iraq, we
                    did exercise a certain amount of influence over him. When he is out of the
                    country, we are not going to have any influence over him.” They had a point. If
                    anything, his terrorism increased, as a result of his being expelled from Iraq,
                    at that stage.</p>
                <p>Basically, the Iraqis came to power with a anti-Western philosophy. They felt
                    that their country had been dominated by an elite, who were exploiting the rest
                    of the population in cooperation with the Western capitalist countries. Their
                    philosophy called for the overthrow of that elite, and the establishment of a
                    socialist economy. Their role models were more in the communist bloc than in the
                    West as far as the kind of society they wanted to set up. So there was nothing
                    here that made them natural partners of the U.S., until the Iraq-Iran war came
                    along. I think now, they are moving in the direction of free enterprise, as is
                    the Soviet Union and is Eastern Europe, of course. They are part of that
                    movement. As part of that movement they are anxious to get on better commercial
                    and economic terms with us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '65-'68 period, were we trying to get them to do
                        anything, or stay out of it? Do we have any particular control there?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>WILEY: After our break in relations at the time of the '67 War, Iraq did not play
                    an important role in the minds of the policy makers in Washington. For a long
                    time, we didn't have any representation there at all. It finally started with an
                    intersection, when I arrived there in late '74-'75. There had been one officer
                    there ahead of me, Art Lowery was a head of the intersection before me for about
                    two years. So he got there about '72, or thereabouts. But from '67 until '72,
                    there were no diplomats at all stationed in—there was no intersection. Then it
                    was a very low level operation until we finally resumed relations back in '85, I
                    believe it was, when full diplomatic relations were restored.</p>
                <p>During that time, there was minimal contact between the United States and Iraq.
                    There was some oil activity of interest to American oil companies, but that had
                    all been nationalized by the Iraqis in '67. They had to sell their oil, of
                    course, and some of the international oil companies were lifting oil from Iraq.
                    But we weren't involved in the exploration or production. That was done by the
                    Iraqis themselves, largely with Soviet assistance, and Soviet technology in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We must have been quite concerned though about the
                        penetration of Soviets into the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, that was a concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we do anything about it? Was it sort of, “Let's hope
                        it doesn't spread”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We didn't have much influence in the Iraqi regime. They, in fact, the
                    Baath party suppressed the Communist party in Iraq, rather brutally, after they
                    consolidated their power because they saw the Communists as a threat to their
                    power. They managed to maintain fairly good relations with the Soviet Union, in
                    spite of that, and, of course, the Soviet Union was their main supplier of
                    weapons during the Iraq-Iran war. Largely, because, I think, they saw the Iraqis
                    as being ideologically closer to the Soviet Union in terms of their social and
                    economic structure, which they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, trying to go back to this period in the mid- to the
                        later '60s, could we look with a certain amount of lack of
                        apprehensions—poor word—on Soviet influence in Iraq, on the assumption that
                        here is a regime, that is, essentially, going to be doing its own thing, and
                        it is not going to be a cat's-paw of the Soviets, or were we more concerned
                        than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WILEY: I think there was probably more concern here than was warranted by the
                    facts of the situation. The extent to which Iraq was becoming a puppet of the
                    Soviet Union. The Iraqis are nobody's puppets. I think the Russians, at times,
                    found them pretty difficult to deal with. They were willing to go along with the
                    Soviets on international issues that were not of immediate concern to them in
                    voting in the U.N. But when it came to regional politics they were very
                    independent, and they didn't take orders from the Soviet Union or anybody
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at our policy, particularly, in many of the
                        post-war years, there is a tendency to feel that once somebody turned to the
                        Soviet Union for assistance, they became a puppet of the Soviets, when,
                        actually, almost all these countries had their own self-sealing devices
                        which would prevent allowing any sort of Communist regime to take over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: If anything, the Soviets frequently antagonized these countries when their
                    presence there was not done in a way that made them very acceptable to the local
                    regimes. I was in Egypt, when the Russians were kicked out of Egypt later on,
                    and it was a similar type of situation there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we turn to that? You spent a year with the RAND
                        Corporation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in that? This was '68 to '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I went there in lieu of senior training. In fact, that was my year of
                    senior training. It was a very interesting year, because they did not have many
                    people at RAND in those days, who had much detailed knowledge of the Middle
                    East. So I was sort of their resource person when they were talking about the
                    Middle East. They were focusing more on Soviet-U.S. relations, nuclear weapons.
                    Jim Schlesinger was the head of the strategic analysis department at RAND in
                    those days. Bill Kwat (phonetic) was a young student, just out of MIT with RAND
                    when I was there, who had had some experience with the Middle East. He and I
                    were the only two Middle East people there, really. Fred Ikl� was my immediate
                    boss, who later became the number three man in the Pentagon, as you know.</p>
                <p>So it was a rather interesting experience working with these people, many of whom
                    became quite prominent later on, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did RAND play? You hear about a think tank, but
                        were these people thinking, or did it go anywhere or have any effect? Was
                        the thinking, would you say, rather to the point and helpful, or was it sort
                        of up in the air?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: RAND was sort of a half-way house between the government and the academic
                    world. They didn't have any students, of course, so they only did research and
                    wrote papers, and consulted, and that kind of thing. I would say that they did
                    have an impact in a couple of ways. In a few cases, studies done at RAND were
                    very influential in determining our policies in the U.S. government. A famous
                    study of overseas basing, for instance, did become policy. We stopped trying to
                    base our bombers overseas, and instead we developed strategic capabilities that
                    would operate in the U.S. or from submarines, you know. They were quite
                    influential in pushing that process along, based on the studies that were
                    generated at RAND.</p>
                <p>The other way in which they did have a lot of influence, was that a lot of the
                    people at RAND, it was sort of a training period for them. They later came into
                    important jobs in the government, like Schlesinger, who became Secretary of
                    Defense, the head of the CIA, and the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, all
                    of them after his experiences at RAND. A lot of the knowledge that he gained in
                    these areas came from his time at RAND, of course. Fred Ikl� who became the
                    Director of Policy for the Pentagon, was my immediate boss at RAND, and he
                    learned a lot while he was at RAND, of course. Bill Kline, of course, went into
                    the NSC staff, as the principal Middle East guy under Carter, and he and his
                    training was primarily at RAND.</p>
                <p>So, in that sense, they also did influence government policy. It was people that
                    came out of the RAND think-tank who moved into policy positions in Washington. I
                    think there also were a number of studies that were done at RAND that went into
                    the file and nobody paid much attention to. And I think there is a certain level
                    of frustration for people in think-tanks for that very reason. They do spend
                    months doing a study, and they feel that no one really is paying any attention
                    to it when they finish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, true within government, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Exactly, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1969. You were assigned as deputy

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Actually, at that stage it was deputy principal officer, we didn't have an
                    embassy then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the situation was when you went
                        there, what our interests were, what so-called embassy or intersection was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: At this point, we had quite a small staff in the interests section,
                    compared to the rather huge embassy we had there in '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a place where, technically, we did not
                        have diplomatic relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: That's right. We broke relations at the time of the '67 War. A few months
                    afterwards, we started feelers with the Egyptians as to whether or not they
                    would be interested in setting up an intersection between the two sides.</p>
                <p>I got there in '69. The intersection had been going for some months prior to
                    that. Don Burgess was my immediate boss in those days. He was the head of the
                    intersection, and I moved in as the number two man. The main purpose was to try
                    to repair the ruptured relations that had taken place in '67, and to get us back
                    onto a more solid relationship with Egypt, which continues to be a key country,
                    of course, in the Middle East. We had stopped our major aid program, for
                    instance, when they broke relations. We still had these large quantities of
                    Egyptian pounds in Egyptian banks, that were sort of frozen because we didn't
                    have any uses to put them to after our relations were broken.</p>
                <p>The Russians, of course, had come in and had established a major influence, both
                    with the army and the political side, supplying military equipment to the
                    Egyptian armed forces. They were giving substantial economic aid to the
                    Egyptians in the period from '67 until we later resumed our diplomatic relations
                    with Egypt. Then, of course, there was the Arab-Israel equation, which Egypt was
                    then a major player in that situation. So that our interests in Egypt were
                    largely, at that stage, concerned with Israel because of our interest in Israel.
                    I mean Egypt was one of the principal military threats, of course, to Israel,
                    and the possible source of explosion which, of course, did come about in '73. We
                    were worried that war would break out again, which it finally did in '73, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the war of attrition on at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, that was, while I was there. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, after all Egypt is a much larger, and potentially
                        more important country than Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Not politically.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not politically, but your work there was really focused on
                        the problem of Israel more than Egypt per se.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think its safe to say, that from the point of view of U.S. policy, that
                    was our major concern, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet influence there? Were we just
                        passive by-standers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: There wasn't too much we could do about it. We didn't even have formal
                    diplomatic relations ourselves with the Egyptians at that point. We didn't like
                    it, of course. We were happy when the Soviets were finally kicked out by the
                    Egyptians, which is largely due to their own mismanagement of the relationships,
                    rather than to anything that we did, and to Sadat's feeling that he had to swing
                    the country's policy back more into a Western orientation from the position that
                    Nasser had left it in when he died. It was largely under Nasser's influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nasser died in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was when I was there. I think it was about 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think it was about that time. He died in August
                        1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: And Sadat, I think, did not like the Russian presence. The Russian
                    military was not very popular with the Egyptian military. They were pretty
                    heavy-handed in the way they did things and joked about the Egyptians in so many
                    ways that antagonized the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time you were reporting back that the Soviet
                        penetration of the Egyptian military was basically minimal, did we feel it
                        at that time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was important, militarily speaking, to the Egyptians. After all, we
                    weren't giving them any arms. They were the main support of their weapons. And,
                    of course, the Israeli lobby was very worried about the Russian presence in
                    Egypt. It could be used against Israel. In the general cold war climate that
                    still persisted, we were always worried about any Soviet increased influence,
                    particularly, in fairly strategic places, like Egypt was.</p>

                <p>WILEY: Yes, and the Russian navy was using bases, particularly in Alexandria at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you talk to the Egyptians? You didn't have
                        diplomatic relations. How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We had channels set up, including one to the foreign minister who was an
                    Egyptian named Mahmoud Riad, who was somewhat shorter in stature than his boss,
                    so we used to call him “Little Mo”, as opposed to “Big Mo”, the foreign
                    minister. [Laughter] But Mahmoud Riad was a very sophisticated Egyptian, who
                    spent a lot of time in the U.N., loved the city of New York, loved the U.N. He
                    was sort of our designated interlocutor. But he sat right in the foreign
                    minister's office, so we did have access through him at a pretty high level to
                    the foreign minister. But if we had a demarche to make, it was to Mohammed that
                    we'd make it. He would take it in to the foreign minister.</p>
                <p>Don Burgess occasionally did see the foreign minister, and even saw Nasser,
                    himself, from time to time. Although the every day contact was at lower levels.
                    Then I, as the number two, handled most of the economic matters, and I had a
                    designated contact, who was the number-two-man in the ministry of economy.
                    Whenever I had to discuss something of an economic nature, I took it up with
                    him. These two men, plus one man in the Presidency, were the three points of
                    contact that were designated for us to have, and these were all pretty
                    high-level people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the relationship, actually, was not overly hurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: No, it was much more constrained when I went to Iraq in the intersection.
                    There, contacts were kept at a much lower level, than we had had in Egypt. In
                    Egypt, we had pretty high level contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before, we turn to Iraq, I would like to ask about what
                        did you do, and what did we all do, during the '73 war there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WILEY: I left there just before the '73 war, so I was not on the ground. I was
                    there at the time of the war of attrition, that went on for some time. This was
                    because Nasser had ordered his troops to do a certain amount of firing across
                    the canal, just to let the world know that they didn't acquiesce in a permanent
                    occupation of the Sinai by the Israelis. The Israelis responded in kind, and
                    shooting back and forth began to escalate to the point where the Israeli Air
                    Force was bombing targets around Cairo. In fact, they bombed a military camp on
                    the outskirts of Maadi, the area of Cairo where I lived, and hit the camp which
                    was located right next to the school where my children were going to school at
                    the time. That was a bit disturbing. It killed a number of soldiers in the camp.
                    That also tended to bring the Russians in, because as this escalated with the
                    Israeli planes bombing targets in Egypt, the Egyptians began to try to stop them
                    with both ground-to-air missiles, and their own fighter aircraft. There were a
                    couple of clashes where a number of Egyptian planes were shot down.</p>
                <p>Also, the Russians then decided to supply Egypt with the SAM 3 missiles, which
                    are fairly advanced ground-to-air anti-aircraft missiles, which Egyptians began
                    using then against the Israeli air force. So this all began escalating to the
                    point where it was beginning to be a serious confrontation between the two
                    sides. It didn't really stop until the war in '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before leaving the Egyptian picture, and moving to Iraq,
                        when Nasser died, what was our interest section's evaluation of Sadat at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We did not have as high an impression of Sadat as he later acquired, I
                    would say, in the U.S. government circles. In fact, when I first went there,
                    when Nasser was still alive, Sadat was sort of the designated anti-American. He
                    was going around the country making speeches attacking the United States, I
                    presume under orders from Nasser. Many times saying things that were out-right
                    lies, that we would have to go in and protest as being, you know, falsehoods,
                    that Sadat was saying in his speeches that were carried on the radio and put
                    into newspapers. After, Nasser died, and Sadat took over, then he really decided
                    he had to move their orientation more toward the U.S., so he stopped that, of
                    course. Eventually, he became the darling of the United States government
                    because of his decision to make peace with Israel, and to go to Israel. Of
                    course, that happened after the war of '73. Initially, we did not have that high
                    an opinion of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the feeling that he probably wasn't going to
                        last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think, we probably felt that, yes, that he would not last all that long.
                    He turned out to have more staying power, although, in fact, when he died, it
                    didn't create anything like the popular out-pouring of grief that it did when
                    Nasser died. He was never the hero among the Egyptian public, that Nasser was.
                    He was much more of a hero in the U.S. than he was among his own people in
                    Egypt.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you served a rather solid period as the head of our
                        U.S. interests in Iraq from '74 to '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, in between, I was back here for awhile and became the country
                    director for North Africa. I held that job for about a year before I went out to
                    Baghdad and set up an intersection there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we move to the Iraq situation. We've already
                        talked quite a bit about Iraq, but what were you doing there? I mean, what
                        developed during this '74 to '77 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: That was a very interesting period, because our relations with Iraq had
                    really been almost non-existent from '67 on, from the time of '67 War, and after
                    the Baath party took power in Iraq. So there we were really trying to
                    re-establish relations. In the case of Egypt, even though we formally broke
                    diplomatic relations, we still had a lot of dialogue back and forth, a lot of
                    economic matters. We even had cultural programs running using the accumulating
                    currency that we had in the bank accounts, and so on. But, in the case of Iraq,
                    there really was very little contact between the two sides, either privately, or
                    at the government level. So this was much more virgin territory, in a sense,
                    where we had to start from the scratch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of given orders to do something about it?
                        Where did the initiative come to try to re-build the relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I don't think there was any strong urging on the part of the U.S.
                    government to rebuild the relationship. It was, I think, just the feeling that
                    this was a fairly large, fairly important country in Arab contexts. They seemed
                    to be willing to establish intersections, so we would be willing to reciprocate,
                    and have our intersections.</p>
                <p>When I first went out there, I don't think we had any particular policy designs
                    about Iraq, other than to gradually improve relations to the extent that the
                    Iraqis were willing to do so, but we weren't going to force the issue. In fact,
                    my original contacts were limited to a young lady in the protocol office of the
                    foreign ministry. I really couldn't see anybody else when I first got there,
                    though, later, I was able to make some higher level contacts in the foreign
                    ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what were we doing? When you are dealing with the
                        protocol office, you are at the bottom of any list practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WILEY: That's right, we were. We did some reporting in Iraq. There was a dearth
                    of information about Iraq, of course, back here in the government, since we
                    hadn't had an embassy there. It's hard to get information there, but through
                    contacts in the diplomatic community and elsewhere, we did do some reporting on
                    what was happening in the country. Some assessment of the Baath party and the
                    leading personalities of the party, and so on. Really, there was a total void of
                    information about Iraq back in Washington in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume, in a case such as this, more than in many
                        other places, where you find other diplomats are coming to the United States
                        to find out what have you heard in the diplomatic corps. I mean, there is
                        also a sharing of information, but often you don't see this as a larger
                        mission, and it's felt as a key player, that you must have been spending a
                        lot of time sitting at the feet of the French and British, and other
                        ambassadors finding out what was going on in this case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, and some of the Arabic ambassadors were quite helpful. The Egyptian
                    ambassador, who was pretty well plugged in there, and the Tunisian ambassador
                    had pretty good contacts. I was on good terms with them, so I got a lot of
                    information through them, as well.</p>
                <p>We, again, were concerned about Iraq's rather militant anti-Israeli posture and
                    we had hoped to moderate that, of course, when I was there. We viewed Iraq as,
                    potentially, an important trading partner for the U.S., just because it's got
                    the oil. The oil companies, of course, were interested in getting involved in
                    Iraq in the long run, because of the substantial oil reserves. I still think
                    it's going to be a very important commercial partner for the United States. If
                    the country develops, it's going to be, probably, the most important trading
                    partner we have in that part of the world, if things develop properly. But these
                    were all potentials at that stage. We had very little active going on. Q: As far
                    as Washington, or the State Department's, concern, it was what you might call a
                    holding brief there. Nobody was pressing you to get things moving again?</p>
                <p>WILEY: No, I think there was some feeling that the time had come when we probably
                    should renew diplomatic relations, but there was no great pressure on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was more tidying up matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, we had resumed with almost all the other countries at that stage,
                    with whom we had broken in '67, at the time of the '67 War. Iraq was practically
                    the only hold out apart from—I guess, maybe, no, I guess—Iraq was the last one
                    to finally resume diplomatic relations with us. The feeling was that it was
                    potentially an important country. One that, if they ever got their act together,
                    could be quite important, both politically and economically, in that part of the
                    world. To the extent that we could gradually establish better government
                    relations, fine, but there was no great pressure to do it, I don't think. There
                    was more pressure on the reporting side, to fill this void of information that
                    had developed about Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Granted, you were not in much of a position of power, but
                        were you concerned from your vantage point about the very close relations
                        that, particularly, Kissinger and Nixon seemed to be pushing toward Iran?
                        There seemed to be a loading of Iran down with a lot of armament and all
                        this. Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was to me. In those days, Arabists commenting on Iran were not very
                    well received in the department. There was a kind of saying going
                    around—”Scratch an Arabist, and you'll find an anti-Iranian.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was a feeling that you had localitis, and that the Arabs and the
                    Iranians were enemies. You tended naturally to side with the Arabs. Therefore,
                    you didn't like the Shah and things in Iraq. But it was a little broader than
                    that, I think. In the bureaucracy as a whole, there was, I thought, a more
                    objective evaluation of the Shah's regime than you found in the top levels of
                    government. The Shah, as you know, had this great charm and he was able to work
                    it on a succession of American Presidents. No one down in the bureaucracy could
                    quite understand how he did it, but he was always able to convince a series of
                    Presidents that he was their kind of man, and they really want to support him in
                    the future. I could never quite understand the attraction that the Shah had for
                    our Presidents, but they certainly did, and this was reflected through the
                    bureaucracy. It was certainly reflected in Kissinger's days, where it was just
                    not very good for your career to be too critical of the Shah.</p>
                <p>I think a lot of people were discouraged from saying things that were critical,
                    even if they honestly believed them about the Iranian regime, because of the
                    interest at a high level of improving relations with Iran and making Iran kind
                    of the linchpin of our policies in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Were you getting any reflections, or you just really didn't
                        have enough connection with the Iraqi government? Was anybody saying, “What
                        the hell are you doing with these Iranians?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILEY: I didn't get that from the Iraqi government so much, in fact, I was in
                    Iraq in the period following the signing of the 1975 agreement in Algiers that
                    Kissinger brokered. In effect, where Iraq and Iran signed this agreement,
                    whereby, Iran would stop supporting the Kurds, and Iraq would recognize Iranian
                    planes to the Shatt al-Arab, to the Iranian boundary. I mean to the middle of
                    the Shatt al-Arab.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shatt al-Arab being the delta river, or whatever you want
                        to call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: The confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. They flowed together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over which the later Iran-Iraq War, that was the cause of
                        the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: It was one of the causes. It's still in dispute right now. Iran claims
                    that the deepest part of the river, should be the boundary between the two
                    sides. Iraq claims all of the shot up to the Iranian shore, and this is what the
                    British had given them when they were running both sides, really, back in the
                    old days. The Iranians were claiming half the river, up to the deepest part of
                    the river, which they still claim.</p>
                <p>In '75 agreement had been reached where Iraq represent accepted Iran's claim to
                    the middle of the river, and, in return, the Iranians stopped supporting the
                    Kurds. We had been assisting the Iranians covertly to help the Kurds. So we
                    stopped doing it, too, at that point. In other words, the Kurds were cut off,
                    and the Iraqis were able to quell the Kurd resistance in the north as a result
                    of that agreement. For awhile there, after that agreement, relations improved
                    between Iraq and Iran.</p>
                <p>In fact, I can remember an Iranian national day, where I was present, and Saddam
                    Hussein actually showed up at the national day. That was quite a signal, you
                    know, that he wanted better relations with Iran at that stage. He didn't come to
                    any national days normally, and this was an exception. He showed up at the
                    Iranian national day with all the camera men taking pictures, and it all spread
                    in the papers the next day, and so on and so forth. So, when I was there, there
                    was a temporary period when relations were actually improving between Iraq and
                    Iran. Later they deteriorated again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you reporting on the Kurd situation, because for
                        many, Kissinger, first we supported this and then we cut the feet out from
                        under the Kurds, and Barzani, who was the leader and all. We left them high
                        and dry, and many of them went into either exile or were killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it from your vantage point, what were you all
                        saying from our interest group there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Generally speaking, I was always a little skeptical that we were following
                    the right policy with our support for the Shah, and, of course, this was related
                    to it. The Iraqis were working out a relationship with the Kurds. That, you
                    know, left the government, obviously, in power. When you really look at the
                    situation, they had not treated the Kurds as badly as a lot of minorities are
                    treated around the Middle East area. The Kurds did have their own
                    representatives in the Iraqi parliament. They were able to keep their language,
                    their customs, their traditions, and so on. The Iraqis never tried to stop them
                    from this, as the Turks did, for instance. The Turks refused to recognize
                    Kurdish culture in any way, and they called them Mountain Turks, instead of
                    Kurds. The Iraqis were more forthcoming than other countries around the area
                    were in dealing with the minority groups.</p>
                <p>I was never convinced that Kissinger and Nixon were on the right track with the
                    Shah. I thought that we overdid it. Certainly, we overdid it in the arms supply
                    relationship. Kissinger really gave orders to the bureaucracy to not question,
                    in any way, any request that the Shah made for U.S. military equipment or
                    support. It didn't go through any of the usual review processes, or the usual
                    committees, didn't consider anything else. It was just automatically granted, if
                    the Shah wanted it, and that was Kissinger's personal orders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the things that often arises in these
                        interviews, about how there was a complete stoppage of criticism of the
                        Shah, a real stoppage of the entire objective reporting process, of what
                        U.S. interests were. Why was this? You know you can make your decision after
                        hearing the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I don't know, other than the stability that the Shah had, on a personal
                    basis, to appeal to the President and the Secretary of State, and convince them
                    that he was their man in the area, and they didn't want any static out of the
                    bureaucracy on this. They had made up their mind about the Shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were feeling some reflection of this, too, from your
                        point, that this is territory where it's best to stick to your own country
                        and stay out of this particular one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I occasionally got into disputes with Dick Helms, who was then the
                    ambassador to Iran, when I was head of the intersection at Baghdad on things
                    that involved Iraq and Iran. I know we had a couple of rather vigorous
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any particular issues that got you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Well, it had to do more of the Shah's attitude toward Arab affairs. The
                    Shah was always looking at it from his point of view, of course. He was always
                    concerned that maybe Syria and Iraq would get back together, to get on the same
                    wave length, and that would be a threat to him. He was hoping that the United
                    States, at times, would take steps that would make sure that Syria and Iraq did
                    not get back on the same wave lengths. I would object to that, saying that does
                    not help us with either country. We are carrying the Shah's water here, in a
                    way, that is contrary to U.S. interests in the area. So I did get involved,
                    sometimes, in our relations to Iran.</p>
                <p>Before I went out to Baghdad, while I was in Washington and was the country
                    director for North Africa, I was detailed for a brief period of time to the
                    inspector's office to do what was called a policy inspection. Jerry Livingston
                    and I went out and traveled all around the gulf including a visit to Tehran, and
                    then wrote a long report on our policy to the area, where a lot of these issues
                    did come up, not only the Arabs, but our relationship with Iran was part of this
                    study. But even in that study, we were told by our bosses, in no uncertain way,
                    that we should not be critical of Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is how the system breaks down. If you have a strong
                        Secretary of State who doesn't want to hear, he doesn't hear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: That's right. He doesn't want any opposition out of the bureaucracy. Of
                    course, Kissinger was notorious for this, anyhow. He viewed the bureaucracy as
                    just another element to manipulate in the external environment that he had to
                    deal with. He dealt with foreign countries. He dealt with the bureaucracy, and
                    he played them off against each other. He retained information from the
                    bureaucracy, if he thought it would help him in his maneuvering with the
                    bureaucracy. I thought his policies, as far as being the head of an
                    organization, were quite destructive to the organization. I'm sure you've gotten
                    this feedback from others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have. You were appointed to Oman as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I went to Saudi Arabia first as DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Saudi Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: A little over a year. I was asked to go to Saudi Arabia by Porter, who was
                    then the ambassador in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Porter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Not Dwight. Ambassador Porter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: He was the ambassador there at the time. By the time I got there, he had
                    been fired, and John West had been sent out, who was governor of South Carolina.
                    John was very much a political animal, very much a politician, and knew almost
                    nothing about the Middle East. But he had been active in Carter's campaign, as
                    one of his supporters. I'm not quite sure why he wanted to go to Saudi Arabia,
                    but, in any case, he did and Carter sent him there, after firing Porter from the
                    job.</p>
                <p>So by the time I got there, there was a brand new political appointee on the
                    scene, who arrived, more or less, when I did as DCM. So I had the experience of
                    dealing with a political ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? Was he able to function at all? The
                        Arab world is a complex world, and we have real interests there. This is not
                        Luxembourg; this is the Middle East. So how did the embassy run, and what
                        did the ambassador do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Relations were never very good between Ambassador West and myself. I
                    thought that he came in with kind of a chip on his shoulder, knowing that he was
                    a political appointee, and that the bureaucracy would probably resent him,
                    particularly, replacing a career Foreign Service Officer, as he did, as
                    ambassador. As a result, he tended to strike first against the bureaucrats as he
                    saw them in the embassy, and I was in the middle as his DCM. On many of these
                    issues, I was much more sympathetic to the bureaucracy, than I was to West. I
                    would tell West this in private, which he didn't particularly appreciate, having
                    his deputy side with the people with whom he was in dispute. It was not a very
                    happy year, I must say, although I feel my personal relationships with West were
                    not very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues that you had to deal with at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Policy issues. John, like many political appointees, felt that he was the
                    appointee of the President. He was not really ready to take orders from the
                    Secretary of State. At times, he would ignore, or even go contrary to
                    instructions from the Secretary of State. I thought he should not have done
                    that, of course. He said, “I'm not the Secretary of State's appointee; I'm the
                    President's appointee.”</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a recipe for disaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning from that rather awkward time, in a way I am
                        surprised that you got an appointment as an ambassador, because sometimes if
                        you are not on the right side of a previous ambassador, particularly one who
                        is connected, this can sometimes be the end of a career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: John had kind of a problem looking at it from his point of view. He was
                    dealing with a bureaucracy, and a career officer, and myself, whom was part of
                    that bureaucracy, that he didn't wish to antagonize totally. After all, he was a
                    very political man, and he understands how political organizations work. I
                    think, he did have respect for me as a substantive officer, and my knowledge of
                    the area, and my reporting, and so on. His own reporting frequently reflected, I
                    thought, quite a lack of knowledge about the area, and I tried to help him in
                    this way, and, I think, generally, he did appreciate this. He knew that I was
                    respected back in Washington, although he also knew that Washington knew that
                    there was a conflict going on here. So he supported my nomination for an
                    ambassadorship. This enabled him to bring in someone, whom he wanted as DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Promote up!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes. [Laughter] So he supported my nomination to be an ambassador to Oman.
                    So maybe it helped me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any other politics or maneuvering that came
                        about because of your appointment to Oman? Because sometimes an
                        ambassadorship becomes very much a part of the political process within the
                        State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I don't think there was much legislative or Presidential concern about
                    Oman. I don't think there were any politically powerful people who wanted the
                    job. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the reasons why West stands out as almost an
                        anomaly in the Middle East. For the most part, this is not the place where
                        political animals want to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WILEY: No. So, as far as I know, there was no particular opposition. I think
                    there was a little rivalry maybe, in terms of other FSO's, who would have liked
                    to have the job. But I had the support of the Assistant Secretary in the Bureau,
                    Roy Anthony, whom I had worked with for years, and I knew very well. I'm sure
                    that Roy pushed me very hard to get the ambassadorship, which probably took care
                    of the opposition back from other career Foreign Service Officers. There was no
                    real opposition from any political appointee who wanted the job, and West was
                    for it. He pushed me, himself, through his own political connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you describe what were American interests in
                        Oman at the time? We're talking about '78. Carter was just in for about a
                        year or so at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: When I went to Oman, I think, it was not, again, in the forefront of the
                    minds of policy-makers in Washington. In fact, I was only the second resident
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a treaty there since 1832, I think. By the way,
                        when you talk about Oman and Muscat, is that the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, they use to call it Oman and Muscat, but the name was changed to
                    where it was just Oman, after the conflict back in the '50s, when the British
                    helped the Sultan and put down the Imams revolt in the interior, and after that
                    they stopped calling it Oman and Muscat, it was just called Oman after that
                    period.</p>
                <p>The major thing that was probably of interest to policy makers, when I went
                    there, was what was happening in Iran, with Oman being just across the water. In
                    fact, apart from Kuwait, I was the closest ambassador to Iran. We didn't have an
                    ambassador in Baghdad, of course, in those days. The rather key position on the
                    Strait of Hormuz, of course, going into the Persian Gulf, and over the oil
                    flowing through Strait of Hormuz, and so forth. So that made it geographically
                    important on one side of the choke point, and Iran being on the other side of
                    the choke point. You know, into the Persian Gulf.</p>

                <p>WILEY: Riots and demonstrations were going on, which started while I was still in
                    Saudi Arabia. Interestingly enough, when they first started going on, I was then
                    in the embassy in Jeddah. We were getting lateral distribution on telegrams
                    describing what was happening. Then, all of a sudden, we stopped getting them.
                    Apparently, orders had gone out that any telegraphs that might indicate that the
                    Shah was in trouble should not be distributed any place, except to the proper
                    authorities back in Washington. Because, apparently, we didn't want it too
                    widely known, even among the other embassies in the area, that the Shah was
                    having problems. This was part of that cocoon, again, around the Shah.</p>

                        This was when Kissinger was out at this point, but we still were trying to
                        preserve this relationship. If you didn't say ill things, nothing would
                        happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Well, remember Carter, himself, I think , was pretty much taken in by the
                    Shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he went to that coronation business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: He made some outrageous statements, at the time, I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to get more and more indications that
                        Oman may become a key player in the Iranian business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, as we got to the point when, finally, when the Shah was forced to
                    leave Iran. I sent in some—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '79, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, it was '79. I sent in some telegrams that I heard later were actually
                    given to Carter to read personally, talking about the consequences of the shift
                    in Iran, and the importance now of protecting the Strait of Hormuz. The access
                    to the oil supplies, and so on, which go through the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Until that point, most of our cards had been based on the two-pillar policy of
                    the Shah and the Saudis as representing our interest in the area. We gave the
                    Shah this military equipment, presumably, on the theory that he was going to
                    maintain security in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and keep the access to
                    oil open for us. Now that he was gone, we no longer had anybody doing that. I
                    pointed out that the supply lines in and out of the Gulf through these important
                    oil fields was now much more tenuous. You know, we didn't really have a good
                    security plan for that area. This, of course, started a lot of thought back in
                    Washington. They eventually got even more concerned, because it was just after
                    this time when the Russians invaded Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in December of '79, I guess, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think that is correct, if I remember correctly, yes. So it was shortly
                    after the Shah had left the country, and the revolutionary regime had taken
                    over. Then you had the Russians coming into Afghanistan. So these two events
                    really got people worried. They were afraid of military expansion by the Soviet
                    Union into the Gulf area. At the same time, we had lost our pillar of our
                    support there in the Shah. That's what started the whole idea of the rapid
                    deployment force.Carter made a speech in which he mentioned the Gulf area as a
                    third area of vital interest to the United States. This was done after a lot of
                    debate within the bureaucracy, implying that we would, if necessary, use
                    military means to protect our vital interests in the Gulf area. Then when he
                    turned to the Pentagon and asked them to tell him just how we were going to go
                    about protecting these vital interests. The Pentagon was not really able to come
                    up with anything, because they didn't have any military muscle that could be
                    projected into that part of the world. This got people pretty concerned. The
                    President was out on a limb. He had said we were going to fight, if necessary,
                    and we didn't have the means to fight, you know, in that area.</p>
                <p>So, in deciding what to do about it, the Pentagon developed the rapid deployment
                    force concept, which said, in effect, that we would identify certain highly
                    mobile units around the world that could be put into the Middle East area
                    quickly, if need be. Then we set about trying to make basing arrangements or
                    access agreements with various countries in the area, who would make it possible
                    for these forces to be moved into the area quickly, if we had to do so at some
                    future date.</p>
                <p>We had to think about things like pre-positioning equipment, having training
                    activities in the area, so, if the troops ever had to go in there, they would
                    know the kind of terrain they're facing, what the problems would be, and so on.
                    We did some pre-positioning down in the Seychelles Islands of ships with
                    military equipment on board, and so on. All focused again on the Gulf area, and
                    the oil resources in the Gulf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government like in Oman, and then how did you
                        deal with them on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WILEY: It was very much a one-man rule under the Sultan, and he had a group of
                    mainly merchant families with whom he cooperated closely. These merchant
                    families generally supplied the ministers for his cabinet, since, when he took
                    over the country, the merchant families were the only people that could read and
                    write, apart from some of religious establishment in the country. So he relied
                    on them, and in return he gave them favored positions as far as being agents in
                    government contracts, and things like this. So that you ended up with a very
                    wealthy group of merchant families close to the Sultan who were really running
                    the country, which was not that much different from what we had in Iran, prior
                    to the revolution.</p>
                <p>One major exception was that the Sultan avoided getting into an open fight with
                    the religious establishment, where as, the Shah was in a pretty open conflict
                    with the religious establishment in Iran. The Sultan never did that. He was able
                    to avoid that. But it was a government run by merchant families, in effect, and
                    the Sultan and his family. The British were still very influential. The
                    commanding officers of all three branches of the military were Brits. The
                    principal advisor to the Sultan was a Britisher, Tim Landen, who, again, was a
                    military officer, British, although he had retired as a British military
                    officer, and was on contract then with the Omanis. The Brits still had a great
                    deal of influence in the commercial life, and in the government policy,
                    generally, in Oman. I think Landen, who didn't always see eye-to-eye with the
                    British government on these issues did advise the Sultan to co-operate more
                    closely with the U.S., because the Brits were withdrawing from all over the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had actually taken over the responsibility with
                        COMIDEASTFOR back in the '50s when the Brits had withdrawn most of their
                        naval force from that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, but that was never much of a force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of destroyer tenders, I think, something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, and the one supply ship that was the admiral's flagship in the area.
                    So our forces stayed through all of this, but it was based in Bahrain, of
                    course, not in Oman. Then the Brits withdrew from the Masirah Island, which had
                    been just an island just off the southern coast of Oman, which had been an
                    important British airfield, when they had interest all through that part of the
                    world. So Masirah Island was left unprotected, basically, after the British
                    withdrawal.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I think the strategic thinkers around the Sultan, like Tim Landen, did encourage
                    them to enter into some kind of a working relationship with the U.S. for his own
                    security. The access agreements emerged out of that, where we had the rights to
                    use certain military facilities in Oman, on condition that, first of all, we get
                    the approval of the Omani government, on a case-by-case basis. They could be
                    used either in an actual emergency or for training purposes. In return, we spent
                    quite a bit of money building up these military facilities. Hangers, aircraft,
                    air fields—we did a lot of work down in Masirah Island in building up the
                    facilities there, so that you could move a squadron of fighters from Europe down
                    there if we wanted to at some future date. That was the thinking behind it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a confluence of interest there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, the Brits didn't want us to go too far. They wanted us to have some
                    kind of a protective umbrella over Oman, but they wanted to continue to run the
                    Trucial Oman Scouts, and they wanted to continue to sell very expensive, and
                    often quite inappropriate military equipment to Oman without U.S. interference.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any sort of set-tos on this particular
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I did locally, but I never got much backing in Washington. Washington was
                    happy to let Oman stay British. If they wanted to waste their money on tanks
                    that were designed for the nuclear environment in Europe, which they could never
                    use in Oman, but which cost ten times what a normal tank would cost, that was
                    the decision the Omanis made, and Washington was not going to get involved in
                    it.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a little about the strategic working out of this. I had two major
                    concerns about the rapid deployment for us. In the first place, I thought it was
                    oriented the wrong way militarily, and that was partially because of Pentagon
                    politics. When this came up as an important strategic area, of course, the three
                    services were all anxious to get a piece of the pie. A piece of the budget would
                    go along with it, of course. The only way the Army could justify a major role in
                    this was in the role of a U.S.-Soviet confrontation. That's the only reason that
                    you should put anti-tank weapons, heavy armor, and so on, in Oman was in the
                    context of a possible invasion of that region by the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I thought that this was a diversion of resources. I didn't think the Russians
                    were ever seriously going to invade that part of the world. It would have been
                    general war. If there was general war, there were a lot better places for us to
                    fight than there at the end of these tremendously long supply lines, and hostile
                    environment in the Middle East, you know. So I didn't think that we should build
                    up our forces in Oman, or in the Gulf, generally, as a counter to the Soviet
                    Union. I thought what we should do is put in relatively light, highly mobile
                    forces, which meant essentially Navy and Marine units, who could be used in case
                    of local emergencies, in local conflicts, or attempts to subvert our friends in
                    the area, that kind of thing. I thought we needed some force in the area, but
                    the force should be in the context of the regional politics, not in the context
                    of U.S.-Soviet relations. Of course, the army opposed this, because that would
                    have frozen them out of the action in the Gulf area. It also made me rather
                    unpopular with some of the military types, particularly the army, because I sent
                    in long telegrams discussing these issues, pointing out the real purpose of our
                    forces there should be thinking about how we can apply force quickly, if
                    necessary, to help our friends in local disputes, and that it was only a
                    bogeyman to talk about a Soviet threat to the area. The Pentagon, of course,
                    wanted to use the Soviet threat to get more money, not only for the Army, but
                    for the military, in general, out of the Congress. So they didn't like my saying
                    this about the Gulf area, as such.</p>
                <p>The other concern I had was that we had to keep it low profile. If it were too
                    high a profile, it would hurt our friends. It would hurt the Sultan, because
                    foreign troops on Arab soil are never very popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very definitely true.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: That concept was pretty hard to sell back here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We did keep a low profile. That I did succeed in doing with the help of
                    the Sultan, who also didn't want too high a profile around there. Although he
                    was willing, I think, to go for a higher profile than I wanted. I thought he
                    went too far in accepting a higher profile of the U.S. military. In fact, it did
                    work out to be a pretty low profile operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with American Army people or Navy,
                        but basically Army people, coming out and trying to sell their idea to the
                        Omanis? You're telling them, “I'm in charge here. Don't do this.” Was this a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, to some extent, the debate would go on before they actually came out.
                    The Pentagon's idea of a small presence, was not my idea of a small presence.
                    When the Pentagon thinks of something small, they are thinking of 300 or 400
                    men, when I'm thinking of something small, I was thinking of a unit of 10
                    people. There was this constant tension this way. They would put out what they
                    thought was a small operation, what I thought was outlandish in terms of the
                    high profile it would create in the country. So I had a lot of debate with the
                    policy makers on these issues. We did end up with a relatively small
                    profile.</p>
                <p>The one thing that I opposed, which is still going on, is the use of Oman for
                    Marine landing exercises, as part of this Operation Bright Star in Egypt. In the
                    Gulf area, we're still doing this on an annual basis, and we land a few Marines
                    on the beach, and take them back onto the ships again. I thought that was bad
                    both from the point of view of the high profile, and the simple cost. We've got
                    beaches in California you can land marines on for training. You don't really
                    have to send them half-way around the world to do this. The amount of money
                    these exercises cost is fantastic, both in Egypt and in the Gulf area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The real reason for doing this sort of thing is to show
                        that we have a commitment there. Did you feel that we shouldn't be showing
                        that type of commitment, or did it make that much difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think the commitment is of value to the elite and the power structure in
                    these countries, who are working with us, and this is an important commitment.
                    The commitment is not that important to the average man in these countries, who,
                    if anything, resents the presence of foreign troops. I thought there were ways
                    that we could reassure the elite and the power structure without actually
                    landing forces on the beach, where the average man could see them. I didn't
                    think that was necessary in order to reassure the people we were trying to
                    reassure that we were behind them, in terms of the relationships in the
                    area.</p>
                <p>I was rather unpopular with the Pentagon, because I was constantly trying to cut
                    back the size of the operations that they had in mind. They had big plans about
                    converting Masirah into kind of a “Little America” and things like this, and I
                    was constantly opposing this.</p>

                        your attention was focused to Iran, which was going through all sorts of
                        turmoil. Did Israel play much of a role in any thinking at that time, or was
                        it really almost another world?</hi>

                    and still be in the Arab world. Oman looks out on South Asia and Africa. A lot

                        Pakistan. There were demonstrations and fear of attack on all of our places.
                        This was '79, I believe. Was this right after the hostage crisis
                        started?</hi>

                <p>WILEY: I think this was in '80. This was after the hostage crisis in Tehran.</p>

                        for 444 days. It started, I believe, in November of '79. So we're talking
                        about 1980, and there was an attack on our embassy in Pakistan, in which
                        some Americans were killed. It was burned. What happened in Oman, if I
                        recall, there was concern there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Well, back in Washington, there is a tendency to look at all of these
                    countries as being similar, to a much greater extent than, in fact, they are.
                    Vance, at that stage, who was Secretary of State, put out an order, ordering the
                    evacuation of all dependents, and cutting down the staffs of all the embassies
                    in the Gulf area, after this Pakistani thing, and the attack of Damas in Saudi
                    Arabia came at about that point too. Except Saudi Arabia, the Saudi's desk
                    officer went in and said we can't do it in Saudi Arabia, because we have too
                    many people there. We can't cut back the embassy, and take out dependents, and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>Although the attack had taken place in Saudi Arabia, Vance still ordered that all
                    of the lower Gulf countries—he ordered this over the vehement objection of all
                    of the ambassadors, all of us screaming back to him, “Why are you evacuating
                    these companies? They are safer than New York or Washington for our people.”—and
                    they were, literally. But Vance absolutely had his mind made up, and he would
                    not listen to any of the ambassadors, or anybody else on this. He wanted all of
                    the dependents out of these countries, and staffs cut back. We all lost our
                    families for a period of 3 or 4 months, and we all got very quizzical inquiries
                    from our foreign ministers, saying, “What are you afraid of here?” It was very
                    embarrassing to answer. I'd say, “I don't know what we're afraid of.” [Laughter]
                    As far as I could see you're as safe as can be. This was orders from
                    Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This shows the value of saying, “It's the ambassador on

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Vance absolutely had his mind made up on this one, and he would not to
                    listen to any of the ambassadors, and he got very angry at the ambassadors for
                    protesting this. The feelings got very tense between the ambassadors and Vance
                    after awhile over this issue, because we could release no reason at all for
                    evacuating these countries. There were no threats of any kind to our staffs, or
                    our people, or our embassies. Why Vance did it, I still don't quite know why he
                    was so adamant on this.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: We would send in these long telegrams pointed out as logically and as
                    rationally as we could that there is no particular threat to the embassy here,
                    anymore then there has always been. He would say, yes, that is what they told me
                    from Pakistan. Then, the next day, the embassy burned down.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, that was a rather brief attempt early in the war, where the Iraqis
                    approached the Omanis in the possibility of flying sorties out of Oman against
                    Iraq. We strongly recommended to the Sultan that he not buy this and he didn't.
                    Whether he would have done it anyway, I don't know. We strongly advised him to
                    stay out of the Iraq-Iran war.</p>

                <p>WILEY: And the Omanis were not that well defended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all? This was the period of the
                        tremendous oil shock that hit all over by OPEC countries. Was Oman producing
                        enough oil to be a player in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WILEY: No, Oman was a relatively small producer of oil. That actually had come
                    about earlier in the '67 War, and the aftermath of that when the oil shock took
                    effect, and when we had our gas lines, and so on here. The Omanis, in those
                    days, were not producing enough, and they never were a member of OPEC, and they
                    still are not a member of OPEC. They sold their oil either on the spot market,
                    or in quarterly contracts to Japanese and other oil companies that lifted it out
                    of there. Their prices fluctuated more on the spot market, than on OPEC, no
                    fixed rates.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes, I think, we covered most of the interesting points. I had my
                    differences with the military on the rapid deployment force, and with Mr. Vance
                    on his evacuation of personnel, which I found very hard to defend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you retire from Oman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about your differences. Was this a retirement
                        that you called, or was it called on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: No, I mean, I wasn't forced to retire. I could have stayed in. I could
                    have become a diplomat-in-residence, I think would probably been the next thing
                    in order, had I stayed in, at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A diplomat-in-residence is where formal ambassadors are
                        assigned to give lectures at universities for about a year, which is often
                        sort of the end of the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Sometimes it is just a break before you go out in the boondocks again.
                    But, I was at that stage—this was early in the Reagan Administration. Then, the
                    Secretary of State and I didn't see eye to eye on a number of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Alexander Haig.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILEY: Mr. Haig came into office with the idea that we could some how set up this
                    strategic alliance with Israel and the Arabs, and that the Arabs would all join
                    in because they're all afraid of the Russian threat, like we are. This didn't
                    make any sense at all, of course, in the politics of the area. To the Arabs, the
                    threat was not the Soviet Union, the threat was Israel. Mr. Haig never seemed to
                    grasp this. I had some rather strong differences with Haig and his approach to
                    the Middle East and his policies.</p>
                <p>Of course, at that stage, this was just the start of the Reagan Administration,
                    and it looked like Haig could well have been Secretary of State for eight years.
                    In fact, he only lasted about a year after I retired, before he was out. At the
                    point I retired, I did not really want to work under a Secretary of State with
                    whose policies I was in fundamental disagreement, as I was with Mr. Haig. That
                    combined with my feelings that the bureaucracy, in general, including
                    ambassadors, were not being compensated adequately, and I had three kids going
                    into college at that stage. I came out and became a partner in a law firm, where
                    my salary is now two or three times what I was making as an ambassador. With
                    children in college, this was a sensible thing to do. So it was a combination of
                    things, both economic and political reasons, for me to leave at that stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it, this is a question we try to ask of
                        the people we interview for this series. What gave you, in your Foreign
                        Service career, your greatest feeling of accomplishment, satisfaction, would
                        you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: Well, that is an interesting question. I did feel that in Iraq I made some
                    real progress in improving our relations with Iraq, and, of course, I was the
                    head of the intersection there, so I was pretty much on my own in doing this,
                    and could do it at my own initiative. I think our relations certainly didn't
                    turn around totally, but they improved a lot during the time that I was there. I
                    think we laid the ground work for eventually resuming diplomatic relations.</p>
                <p>I thought in Oman I did have a constructive influence on the way our military
                    relationships developed in that part of the world. Though I wasn't particularly
                    liked by the Pentagon, or by some of the strategic thinkers in the White House
                    at that stage, I think I was able to moderate some of the things that would have
                    been harmful to us, had they gone as originally planned, particularly, on
                    keeping it a fairly low profile kind of operation. I think the way its worked
                    out, its been a fairly successful venture. I think it did work out, more or
                    less, the way I wanted it to in the beginning, so I think that was a
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the advantages of being in a place in which
                        there isn't as much high-level attention focused. You can be a real factor
                        in developments there. My final question is, if some young student comes to
                        you and says, “Mr. Ambassador, what about the Foreign Service as a career
                        today?”, how would you reply?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WILEY: Well, I've had a number do that, and I usually have to tell them that I
                    think it is probably less appealing than it was when I went in. I think the
                    Foreign Service has, unfortunately, not been treated the way it should be by a
                    series of Presidents now, who haven't really understood the importance of having
                    a kind of elite Foreign Service Corps, dating back to, at least to, Nixon and
                    Johnson. Nixon, of course, disliked any bureaucrat because he thought they were
                    all against him, as politically, probably most of them were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Professionally, I must say that in the series of
                        interviews I've done, there is more respect for Nixon within the Foreign
                        Service professionals, because he knew his stuff, as opposed to almost every
                        President we've had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: I think in substantive issues he was pretty good, but he did not like the
                    bureaucracy, as such. There was kind of a personal animosity toward the
                    bureaucracy. Carter couldn't stand the idea of any kind of an elite corps. He
                    was too much of a populist for an elite Foreign Service. Reagan, of course,
                    didn't like bureaucracy, either, he just didn't like government, in general, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>You really have to go back to Eisenhower, and Acheson, and maybe the Kennedy era
                    before you find a President who really supported the concept of an elite Foreign
                    Service. You know, above average individuals who can deal with important policy
                    matters, and make important policy recommendations, and so on. I think that has
                    had an effect on the Foreign Service over the years. It has been less attractive
                    because of this, because of the lack of top level support for us.Hopefully, that
                    will turn around with Bush, but, unfortunately, I'm not happy about his
                    ambassadorial appointments. He certainly appointed a whole series of
                    fund-raisers now to ambassadorships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the third month into the new Bush
                        Administration. The Foreign Service, I must say, the people I have talked
                        to, have been quite disappointed because the appointments have been of a
                        pretty low character, as far as the type of people and their lack of
                        political qualifications. It may improve.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: They are political payoffs. So that's been disappointing. But what I
                    usually tell the young fellow who is considering the Foreign Service, or the
                    young lady, is that it really depends on what you want out of life. In many
                    ways, the Foreign Service is still a very interesting way of earning your
                    living.</p>

                    of the prestige law schools, who come in and make fabulous amounts of money.
                    They start off at 70 or 80 thousand a year, first year out of college. By the
                    time they are a partner seven years later, they are making 2 or 3 hundred
                    thousand a year. But I, frankly, wouldn't trade my experience in the Foreign
                    Service for the experience these young men are having in this law firm now,
                    where I am an associate, because it just isn't that interesting of work. It
                    depends what you want. If you want the money, there are places you can go and
                    make a lot more money than you can in the Foreign Service, if you have the
                    qualifications.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if you are interested in foreign affairs, interested in this
                    kind of a life, challenged by the kind of work that you would do in the Foreign
                    Service, then money isn't that important. In spite of the downgrading of the
                    Foreign Service, I still think it does have a very remarkable group of
                    individuals in it, who are quite dedicated and who provide a milieu for their
                    fellow officers, which is not matched in the private sector. You have a feeling
                    of working with people whom you trust, whom you respect. There is less petty
                    back biting and so on in the Foreign Service, than there is in any other
                    institution I have ever been associated with.</p>

                        experience in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILEY: These things are all important. You know, these are intangibles, but it
                    depends on what you want to do with your life.</p>
