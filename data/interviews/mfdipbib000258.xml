                <p>Interviewed by: Self </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 17, 1988</p>

                <p>Introduction</p>
                <p>This is a reflection, many years later, of the highlights of my career with USIA
                    overseas and in Washington from early 1950 to my retirement near age 60 in
                    1976.</p>
                <p>Chile was my first post, at a time when USIA was part of the State Department. At
                    that time it was not a career service, and USIA (USIS overseas) officers were
                    looked down upon by the self-considered elite in State. Yet, having made a name
                    for myself in journalism as a foreign correspondent for Associated Press, I was
                    accepted in Santiago even though I was new to the business and a bit
                    apprehensive about engaging in propaganda — let's face it, that has to be the
                    right word for it — when 15 years as a journalist had conditioned me to resist
                    publicists and ad men.</p>
                <p>At this point, I confess that all through the 25 years of my career with USIA I
                    had some lingering misgivings about propaganda except in situations where I was
                    convinced that US policy was exactly right and that foreign audiences should be
                    brought around, if at all possible, to see things our way. But often I had an
                    unpleasant feeling in the pit of my stomach that our foreign policy was faulty,
                    and that I was in error, in the larger scheme of things, to be involved in
                    propagandizing it. However, the foreign environment in which my wife and I
                    worked was invariably pleasant, the hours and pay were good (considerably better
                    than when I was with AP), and generally speaking we found Embassy people
                    intelligent and attractive colleagues.</p>
                <p>Chile: 1950 - 1952</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The Chileans under President Gabriel Gonzalez Videla were quite pro-US, very
                    simpatico, and seemed content with their democratic regime even though there
                    were pockets of terrible poverty. There was a small communist element, but it
                    presented no threat to the government. Even so, we decided in USIS there that
                    one of our roles was to keep communism from increasing. so we issued news
                    releases to the press and radio about the failureof communist movements in
                    various countries, and how it suffocates the very freedom of which Chileans were
                    so proud. We also showed films around the countryside, films supporting
                    democracy and critical of communism, but also informative about the United
                    States and its institutions.</p>
                <p>One of the most effective pieces of work I did as Information Officer in Chile,
                    in my judgment, was to design, write and have published a comic book, “Juan
                    Verdejo Y sueno de Utopia” (Joe Everybody and his Dream of Utopia), describing
                    how the little man may be attracted by the utopia promised by the communists but
                    winds up worse off than before. The project was praised by Washington as one of
                    the best projects done in years anywhere. The comic book was eagerly grabbed up
                    by youngsters and taken home, and we had the feeling that it was effective in
                    planting seeds of doubt about communist movements. For one thing, it explained
                    what communism was, and we felt that few Chileans except the elite had the
                    vaguest idea. (Later, there was new thinking in Washington headquarters that
                    aiming for the masses was next to useless, that propaganda should be targeted
                    primarily at the educated elite, the potential leadership in any country. Yet,
                    my next post, Cuba, was being run by an unlettered former Army sergeant named
                    Batista.)</p>
                <p>Cuba: 1952-1957</p>
                <p>This was perhaps my most interesting and demanding post, and the most stressful,
                    because US policy supported the Batista Dictatorship, cruel and unprincipled,
                    but anti-communist. Two political ambassadors, Arthur Gardner and Earl E.T.
                    Smith, in the Eisenhower administration were completely sold on Batista, and
                    refused to accept the advice of Embassy intelligence and political officers to
                    back off a little and realize that an opposition movement was growing and could
                    win.</p>
                <p>I believe it highly likely that a tough career ambassador could have convinced
                    Batista early on, when Fidel Castro was first in the Sierra Maestra with his
                    ragtag guerrillas, to conduct an honest election, even at the risk of having his
                    chosen candidate lose, and go off to his home in Daytona, thus eliminating all
                    reason for a Castro revolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In my role as Public Affairs Officer in Havana, having moved up from Information
                    officer after a year, I dealt with all segments of the media and cultural
                    community, but also became involved with pro-Castro people without intending to
                    do so. There were more and more all the time as Batista's excesses became widely
                    known — tortures, killings, corruption. One of our closest friends was an
                    economist, Rufo Lopez-Fresquet, who had an American wife. Rufo later became
                    Castro's Minister of the Treasury, defecting two years later to teach in the US
                    Rufo was extremely close to the Castro movement, although he remained in the
                    capital, and was a great source of intelligence information which he passed onto
                    me and also to my Embassy colleagues in the political and CIA sections once I
                    convinced him they would not betray a confidence.</p>
                <p>But despite this channeling of inside information to the ambassador at staff
                    meetings there was great reluctance at the top to believe there could be any
                    serious movement against the man they often played canasta with and admired.</p>
                <p>I had excellent contacts with the Cuban media and was able to place a great deal
                    of material, but this may be due in part to the official Batista policy of
                    friendship with the US, and an abhorrence of communism, so that editors were
                    under pressure to follow this line.</p>
                <p>My Information Officer, Sher Helms, and I came up with the idea of a colorful
                    monthly poster “Mundo Grafico”, made up of photos and short captions, which
                    store owners placed in their windows to attract customers. Hundreds of these
                    went up for public view all over the island every month. We also put up racks at
                    airports filled daily with USIS pamphlets for travelers to read on the planes.
                    One of the best cultural officers in the business, Francis Donahue, had contacts
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p>Ishort, USIS-Havana was, in my view, a first-rate, highly imaginative,
                    adequately-funded endeavor, and effective in what it set out to do. Yet Castro
                    took over, seized the press and radio stations, converted Cuba to a form of
                    Marxist state, ranted against the United States to thunderous public approval,
                    and US-Cuban relations came to an end.</p>
                <p>It's not that USIS didn't do enough. The people wanted a change. They wanted
                    Batista out and they wanted Castro in, and they still do, 30 years later.</p>
                <p>Washington Assignment</p>
                <p>I was transferred to Washington a few months before the Castro takeover in 1959,
                    serving in USIA as head of the public information office having to do with
                    domestic press relations for the Agency, under, first, GeorgV. Allen, and later,
                    Edward R. Murrow. This was fairly straight-forward work extolling for American
                    readers the highlights of USIS activities overseas, and serving as a spokesman
                    for the Agency on newsworthy developments.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Ed Murrow was perhaps a more enchanting personality and capable newsman than he
                    was an administrator, but he created a needed public awareness of USIA. The
                    public for the first time knew what USIA was all about, and this was, I feel, a
                    morale-booster for its people.</p>
                <p>Mexico: 1960-1962</p>
                <p>In 1960, I was transferred to Mexico City as Deputy Public Affairs Officer, and
                    there helped run a large program which enjoyed considerable success because of
                    Mexican interest in its northern neighbor, based primarily on economics. But the
                    USIS program there was routine, employing the same tried and true tactics used
                    for years all over the world — press releases, radio and TV programs, pamphlet
                    production, writing speeches for the ambassador, attending cultural events in
                    the name of the US It was a large Embassy, and when Tom Mann was Ambassador he
                    commented more than once he'd met people in the elevator who were on his staff
                    but had been around for months without his knowing of them.</p>
                <p>As in other posts, I had the feeling that the higher level Mexicans received so
                    much information about the United States from Hollywood movies and wire service
                    stories in their own newspapers, US radio broadcasts, and the flood of US
                    magazines at their disposal that they really didn't need anything USIS could
                    offer. This information, of course, was both good and bad, and the Washington
                    view was that we had to correct bad impressions about the US held abroad. But US
                    - Mexican history works against us. As one Mexican editor once said to me,
                    “Let's face it, you Americans took the part with all the good roads!”</p>
                <p>My family and I enjoyed living in Mexico and mixing with Mexicans at various
                    levels, but the work offered no great sense of accomplishment. We didn't feel we
                    were changing Mexican attitudes about the US An anti-US bias was built into
                    their history books even at the elementary school level and that is still the
                    case today. Relations are harmed by obnoxious tourists, rich Americans buying up
                    property, problems with border crossings, and the treatment of illegals in the
                    US, petroleum economics, foreign aid debts, and numerous other elements make for
                    strained bilateral relations that no amount of USIS activity could hope to even
                    dent.</p>
                <p>Yet, I was there only two years — too short a tour of duty for Mexico.</p>
                <p>Venezuela: 1962-1967</p>
                <p>Director Murrow assigned me on direct transfer from Mexico to Venezuela as a
                    result of a meeting of USIS chiefs in Lima, Peru, where the Caracas PAO, I was
                    told later, put his arm around Mr. Murrow's shoulders and called him Ed, a
                    familiarity not in keeping with the austere tone of the moment. Mr. Murrow
                    obviously was not amused.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I had been warned that Venezuela would be a drag, that the Venezuelans were
                    aloof, lacking in cultural heritage, and were not liked among other Latin
                    Americans. I found this only partly true. In our widenincirclwe found
                    Venezuelans for the most part bright, party-lovinanproud of their economic
                    fortunes, based on oil production. But they lacked the warmth of the Mexicans,
                    the gaiety of the Cubans, and the sense of humor of the Chileans.</p>
                <p>Like Chile in our day, Venezuela had a democracy of long standing, and, like
                    Chile's dependence on copper, Venezuela had oil. But while there were extremely
                    wealthy Venezuelans, the oil economy only affected a small percentage of the
                    people and there were deep pockets of poverty. Leftist political movements did
                    not thrive, however, but they showed flare-ups of violencatimes. There were
                    kidnapings of US military and businessmen, more for political propaganda
                    purposes than for ransom, and the Embassy more than once was fired upon from the
                    nearby freeway. The university was a safe haven for rebellious students who
                    cached arms on campus knowing that government authorities were not allowed to
                    enter. The university often was closed by the government for months at a time
                    because of political activities.</p>
                <p>In this atmosphere USIS did the usual kind of thing in dealing with the media and
                    cultural circles, hoping to create a more positive image of the United States,
                    and success was there physically if difficult to judge as to its effect on
                    people's minds. The poorer and even middle classes had too much to worry about
                    just surviving to give a damn about the US and its policies. The upper classes,
                    while they might have been swayed to a degree by USIS materials in their
                    newspapers, magazines and films on TV, more than likely had access to a vast
                    amount of other material, including US publications and the impact of visits to
                    this country. Many had kids in US schools and universities.</p>
                <p>Voice of America (1968-1972)</p>
                <p>My five-year tour with the Voice of America in Washington lacked the excitemenof
                    overseas living, but proved professionally the most interesting and challenging
                    of my career. VOA Director John Chancellor wanted me as his deputy when my
                    Caracas assignment came to an end, and I accepted with some trepidation.
                    International radio was complicated, but highly effective. It was an entirely
                    new field for me, and it took several weeks before I got the hang of broadcast
                    frequencies, transmitter locations, program content, policy direction, foreign
                    language talent, slow-speed (”Special”) English broadcasting, news coverage, and
                    the political wallop, the commentary that serves as the government's daily
                    editorial.</p>
                <p>After a year working for Chancellor he bowed out to return to NBC to cover the
                    six day war in the Middle East, and I was left running the place with its 2,200
                    employees for two years, with such stories breaking as the US moon walk and the
                    Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Eventually, since the top job at VOA is
                    traditionally political, Kenneth Giddens from Alabama was brought in to head the
                    place, and I remained his deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It is fortunate that VOA has a lot of radio pros running its various divisions
                    because changes at the top have little or no impact on operations. I did manage
                    to put through, while Acting Director, a directive which lives to this day,
                    giving VOA reporters overseas a free hand to report news as they see it without
                    interference from ambassadors, who tend to be nervous about any reporting from
                    their country of assignment.</p>
                <p>In my time at VOA I came to consider international radio the best means of
                    getting ideas across to people all over the world, and if I had the job of
                    cutting the USIA budget to the very bone, I would eliminate everything but
                    radio, and beef it up considerably. I came to consider expensive other USIA
                    programs largely ineffective on the basis of cost-accounting — useful to a
                    degree, maybe, if you can afford them, but with nowhere the impact of direct
                    broadcasting in dozens of languages. Overseas press releases, films for TV,
                    programs for local radio, books for local libraries — all these things require
                    the services of someone to make a special plea for their use. Radio requires no
                    such middleman. It broadcasts a strong message right over the frontiers and
                    through censors into the ear of the listener.</p>
                <p>Kenya: 1972 - 1976</p>
                <p>USIA Deputy Director Henry Loomis assigned me to Kenya as PAO, observing that in
                    his view, “it's the best damned post in the foreign service”. It was where Henry
                    and his family had made several hunting safaris.</p>
                <p>In a way Henry was right. Kenya was a delight as a place for good living: the
                    best year-around climate in Africa, game abounding in 17 game preserves (one at
                    the edge of Nairobi), a newly-independent nation with an African hero, Jomo
                    Kenyatta, as president.</p>
                <p>Aside from the usual attention to media, USIS sought to influence opinion with an
                    active library program, lectures, art shows for promising young African artists
                    as well as resident Americans, film programs, and books to outlying African
                    libraries.</p>
                <p>No major coup can I claim from my five years there, but I believe we did well in
                    getting high exposure for US policies, at least those which the audiences
                    considered palatable. No kind of USIS activity, to my mind, can sell foreigners
                    on a US policy which they consider against their own best interests.</p>
                <p>Kenya, like many posts, was a favorite objective of frequent-fliers like
                    Congressmen, journalists, and other dignitaries, as well as being the locale of
                    numerous international conferences, all of which meant briefings for visitors on
                    the local situation. On several occasions business men or professional people
                    holding their tax-free annual conferences in Nairobi would sit through such
                    briefings in khaki, while their tour buses double-parked in the street
                    outside.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Politically, what was disturbing about Kenya to me was the widespread corruption
                    at and near the top, and the intense tribalism. Kenyatta may have been
                    relatively clean, but everybody knew that his wife, Mama Ngina, was deeply
                    involved in the ivory poaching trade, and he had numerous relatives, all of the
                    dominant Kikuyu tribe, of course, on the government payroll. Almost every day
                    there would be publicized ceremonies of business men giving huge checks to
                    Kenyatta or his wife for “charity”. (After Kenyatta died and the vice president,
                    Daniel Arap Moi, took over, Mama Ngina was placed under house arrest and
                    prohibited from leaving the country—Moi's effort to show he was against
                    corruption.</p>
                <p>I would have liked to fill out my second tour in Kenya, but I was transferred to
                    Washington, into a made-up job rewriting the PAO handbook, because — it was
                    explained to me — of my of my problems in getting along with the cultural
                    affairs officer, whom I down-graded in a performance report because of his
                    penchant for golf during working hours. He, in retaliation, accuses me of racial
                    intolerance.</p>
                <p>Whatever, I was nearing age 60, and at that time that magic birthday meant
                    goodbye, Charley, unfair as that sounds today.</p>
                <p>I took my retirement a few months before I had to, because I was bored doing
                    practically nothing in USIA, and after 26 years of service, and a Meritorious
                    Honor Award for running VOA during a time of crisis, I walked out of 1750
                    Pennsylvania Avenue having been wished God-speed not by any Director, or even
                    Deputy Director, but by an assistant in the Personnel Office, who even
                    pronounced my name wrong.</p>
                <p>It's not inspirational to realize that every country where I worked for USIA is
                    in worse shape now than when I was there. Chile is no longer a democracy, but a
                    rightist dictatorship. Cuba is a Marxist state, its leadershiantagonistic toward
                    the United States. Mexico has deep resentment toward the United States, and,
                    poverty-stricken, is in hock to this country. Kenya is rife with corruption and
                    in economic trouble, with the world's highest birthrate. All this was beyond our
                    ability to do anything about. Nations go their way, for good or bad,
                    regardless.</p>
                <p>Having worked 12 years as a newspaperman in San Francisco, I convinced VOA that I
                    would be a suitable string correspondent, and have been covering the Bay Area
                    for the past 10 years, voicing stories and features of all kinds. I also cover
                    for the USIA Press service. So, despite my misgivings about some of the USIS
                    activities overseas that I consider extraneous in today's world, and despite a
                    rather disquieting last half-year in USIA employ, I still maintain my lines of
                    communication with the Agency in order to keep my hand in Journalism.</p>
                <p>Addendum</p>
                <p>Richard G. Cushing: 1950-52</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Chile was my first post, at a time when USIA was part of the State Department. At
                    that time it was not a career service, and USIA (USIS overseas) officers were
                    looked down upon by the self-considered elite in State. Yet, having made a name
                    for myself in journalism as a foreign correspondent for Associated Press, I was
                    accepted in Santiago even though I was new to the business and a bit
                    apprehensive about engaging in propaganda — let's face it, that has to be the
                    right word for it — when 15 years as a journalist had conditioned me to resist
                    publicists and ad men.</p>
                <p>At this point, I confess that all through the 25 years of my career with the USIA
                    I had some lingering misgivings about propaganda except in situations where I
                    was convinced that US policy was exactly right and that foreign audiences should
                    be brought around, if at all possible, to see things our way. But often I had an
                    unpleasant feeling in the pit of my stomach that our foreign policy was faulty,
                    and that I was in error, in the larger scheme of things, to be involved in
                    propagandizing it. However, the foreign environment in which my wife (and I)
                    worked was invariably pleasant, the hours and pay were good (considerably better
                    than what I was with AP), and generally speaking we found Embassy people
                    intelligent and active colleagues.</p>
