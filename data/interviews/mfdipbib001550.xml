                <p>PHYLLIS FREEMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Hope Meyers</p>
                <p>Interview date: October 10, 1986</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Hope Meyers. I'm about to interview Mrs. Fulton
                        Freeman at my home.... The date is October 20, 1986.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I was so happy to have a family because my family...my mother went to
                    the hospital when I was ten years old, and from that time I was sent here, sent
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, Father taught at Phillips Academy for thirty years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you and Tony meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, when I got out of college I went with my roommate to New York. I
                    thought New York would be a wonderful place. She was going into the field of
                    design and she wanted to get into Macy's training school. That would be fun. So
                    I went with her. Of course, I didn't get the job because I wasn't convinced,
                    myself, that I wanted it. Shortly after that, about two or three weeks, I
                    couldn't wait to get out of New York. I just couldn't wait.</p>
                <p>It was really kind of a blessing because my father was quite ill then, declining
                    with heart disease, and he'd always wanted me to come home and be his hostess
                    and run the house. I had seen too many old maid aunts in Andover, and I wasn't
                    about to be caught in that situation. But I went home and was perfectly happy to
                    stay there for awhile. I stayed about a year and a half, I guess. But during my
                    college years...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: St. Lawrence, in Canton, New York. That's where my father had gone. I
                    wanted to go to Wellesley but he thought that I couldn't work and get through
                    Wellesley. And he also felt I needed a balance. I graduated from Bradford, which
                    is a girls' school, and I think he thought I needed to learn to have a social
                    life as well as...but I did have to work...and he felt that if I went to
                    Wellesley I wouldn't have any fun, and that I'd just be working all the time. I
                    didn't really like St. Lawrence that much because it was so isolated up in the
                    north country, and I missed going to the symphony with Daddy. I don't know; it
                    was just a different kind of life. I worked every summer at the Lake Placid
                    Club.</p>
                <p>In my junior year I met William Starr Meyers, who was a professor at Princeton in
                    political science. He spent his summers up there lecturing to all the idle rich
                    and old ladies on the political problems of the day, and he wrote a lot of
                    books, vitriolic books against Roosevelt, and I proofread his Hoover papers that
                    summer. You see, he felt that if my father was a professor at Andover, ipso
                    facto I was bright.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father teach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Mathematics. And so he asked me if I would proofread in my free time. I
                    evidently did a very good job proofreading the book, and there were very few
                    errors. Then after working for a year in Andover, I got a telephone call from
                    him saying he needed a secretary and he thought of me. He was writing books and
                    wanted me to work in his home in Princeton, and would I come to Princeton. That
                    was my ticket to paradise because...I didn't want to stay home and get into what
                    I considered to be a dead end for me. Of course, my father said I could go, but
                    it was hard on him because by this time I was taking care of him, and I was
                    working, and my grandmother was dying of cancer in a Boston hospital. All of
                    this going on at the same time.</p>
                <p>But anyway, Dr. Meyers asked could I do shorthand? And I lied through my teeth
                    and said certainly. And he said, “When can you come, next month or next week?”
                    And I said, “No, I can't possibly come until October 1.” I guess this was in
                    June. Well, he was very disappointed but he would wait for me. I went right to
                    night school and got my shorthand. My first dictation was in political science
                    vocabulary. My shorthand was about as limited as “Yours in the first instance.”
                    So, after about an hour and a half of dictation, I was getting absolutely
                    panicked. He said, “Now go home. You've done enough for today.” Well, I couldn't
                    have gone home; I had to read whatever it was there. I always said it was my
                    book. But he never changed it too much. Anyway, I got better after a while, and
                    you get used to somebody's vocabulary, so I had my own shorthand. It certainly
                    was no longer anything that I had got in school.</p>
                <p>Then he wanted his library catalogued. Well, then I sort of had to learn how you
                    catalogue a library, and I'm sure that wasn't done very well, but I did it all,
                    cross-filing and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>And in the meantime on Sundays...oh, I earned enough money to pay for my room,
                    and then I had to eat all of my meals out, and one of the thrills of my lifetime
                    was saying good morning to Einstein every day, or almost every day, as he was on
                    his way to the — what's the institution?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Institute for Advanced Studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Anyway, I got into a routine and I found out that I could live on my
                    money if I didn't eat three dinners a week, so then I thought, well I'd better
                    get some dates. Eventually I had enough friends there, but it was tough going.
                    Sundays the Meyers always held open house for the graduate students and that was
                    part of my job, to serve tea and sandwiches, and that also was my Sunday meal, I
                    might add. They were just darling to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't
                    meet Tony until February.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was there as a student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: He was there as a student but he was always off somewhere; I don't think
                    he ever came to those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Professor Meyers' student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I don't think so. I don't really remember. Professor Meyers taught
                    beginning political science and government, and he wanted me to attend class and
                    take down his new ideas and his new notes. Well, they didn't change at all. I
                    think that was one of my biggest disillusions. Here was somebody who had taught
                    for 30 years and picked a living subject. Well, if you've got to talk about 1775
                    that's fixed, but past that it was pretty fixed in cement. I never really saw
                    him when he was working with graduate students, but these were maybe
                    undergraduate students.</p>
                <p>Tony was in the — what was the school? Anyway, he was there as a graduate student
                    in political science. I kept hearing about him and everybody said, “You've got
                    to meet Tony.” Well, after he left college, he'd been going with a girl for a
                    long time, and her father insisted that if Tony married this girl, he had to
                    live next door and go into the family company in Texas. I'm sure that that's
                    what finished it more than anything, as Tony was already headed for the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you about that, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Tony went to Pomona where Dr. Edmunds was President. He had been
                    President of Lingnan University. On the bulletin board at Pomona was a notice
                    about exchange students to Lingnan and the first Japanese-American student
                    conference in Japan. The exchange, by the way, is still going on. So Tony went
                    to the conference and then on to Lingnan for one academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had already been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: No, he was an exchange student in his Junior year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but he'd already been there when you met him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, yes. When the year in Canton was coming to an end, he wrote his
                    mother and said, “I've already been across the Pacific, Mother. I'd like to
                    bicycle to the Olympics and come home that way.” They were in Germany that year.
                    So, three boys started out from Canton and bicycled all through Indochina, Bali,
                    Java, Sumatra. (Tony knew the name of every place where there was any fighting
                    during the Vietnam War.) It was an incredible trip when you think about it. They
                    bicycled all the way to Lucknow, India, where they got awfully tired of
                    bicycling through India. By that time they would throw their bicycles up on an
                    overhead rack on a train and ride at night. There they bought a car and they
                    drove across several deserts to Athens, whereupon he became very, very ill. The
                    other boys went on to the Olympics and then home, but Tony spent something like
                    four months in Athens in a hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took care of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Peggy. His sister, who graduated from nursing school in Montreal,
                    Canada, was sent by Tony's parents on a boat to get Tony, but this was four
                    months later and he was just a wraith. He had already been pronounced dead
                    several times. An interesting thing is that the only duplication on our wedding
                    list was the Consul in Athens who took care of Tony. He was somebody that Daddy
                    had been very fond of in Andover and had tutored him while he was attending
                    Andover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't find that out until then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: No, we didn't realize, and by that time maybe Daddy had lost track. I
                    found that an interesting coincidence.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So Tony came back. He'd lost a whole year of school, and he lost three ribs. It
                    took him quite a while to come back from this illness, and they never were quite
                    sure what it was that he had had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds terrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Everything was in French in the hospital, and no papers came home with
                    him, so this all became a little bit nebulous as far as the medical knowledge of
                    what he'd gone through. When he came to Princeton with his right-hand drive car,
                    he was quite a character. He'd been around!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Around the world certainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: So, I finally met him, and from the minute we met, that was it. I mean
                    it went like a spiral. I had been going with a boy for years. It was one of
                    those things that everybody knew that I was going to marry him. But there again,
                    I was trying to get away. I wanted to be...I wasn't sure. But I knew I was sure
                    when I met Tony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had he already taken the Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, he was going to get his Master's at Princeton and his family was
                    furious because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Tony from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: He was from Pasadena, California. His father was the Presbyterian
                    minister — a very well known Presbyterian minister, and of course they wanted
                    him to get his Master's degree before he went into the Foreign Service. A friend
                    of his at Cal Tech was a very close friend of the family and Tony knew him very
                    well so Tony went to him for advice. What should he do? He wanted to go into the
                    Foreign Service, and so he was told that he really should go to Princeton, and
                    that he needed maturing. But Tony then wanted to marry me, and nothing was going
                    to stop him, and I'm sure I didn't help. Tony finished his one year at Princeton
                    and went to Washington, met Chuck Burrows, roomed with him, and that's how our
                    friendship began with Chuck. We were married in October. The family finally
                    accepted that there was nothing they could do about that, and the next March 8th
                    we were in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As quickly as that...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Tony passed his exams and we went back to Pasadena and got married. We
                    went to Pasadena because my father was on a sabbatical, and he'd always planned
                    to go to California to lie in the sunshine. The family doctor said, “Phyllis, if
                    you let your father put on a wedding...” He was my mother, very much my mother.
                    Putting on the wedding was a job that he could do beautifully. The flowers would
                    be perfect. The doctor said, “If he does that, that'll be the end. His heart
                    won't take it.” So we talked Daddy into saying, “Okay, if you're going to
                    California, I'll meet you there.” That's where Tony's family is and we want to
                    be married by Tony's father. My father would have nothing to do, just come to
                    the wedding. So that's what happened and people at home never did
                    understand.</p>
                <p>There were 1500 people at my wedding and I knew just a few of them. Well, here is
                    a very favorite minister, and one of the favorite children of the minister. I
                    had a choir of 50 children with candles going down ahead of me. It was a
                    gorgeous wedding. Just gorgeous. But, you know, Robert Freeman was the minister,
                    Robert Guthrie Freeman was the best man, David Freeman was an usher, Peggy
                    Freeman was the maid of honor, and Zoe Beth Freeman was the flower girl. It's
                    the funniest newspaper article you've ever read but that didn't matter to me at
                    all. But my father collapsed after the wedding and they never told me. I was so
                    upset about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go immediately then to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, then Tony found out that he'd passed the written [examination]. We
                    were married before we found that out, but nothing could stop us. He was going
                    back to school at Stanford to finish his Master's, and I was going to support
                    him by getting a job. We went up there and picked out the cutest little doll
                    house under an oak tree. We were going ahead with those plans because we didn't
                    have any nickels and nobody was giving us very much. My father couldn't, and, as
                    I said, we'd made our decision so we had to do something about it. But then he
                    passed so we went to Washington for the oral exams. We drove across the
                    continent with our goods and chattels in a swivel-wheel trailer — that was a
                    good trip. I think his date was Monday morning on the 3rd day of January. Then I
                    think we heard — well, I think he knew really that he'd passed the orals at that
                    point, but not officially — that came fairly shortly. Then we had to sit and
                    wait for a job.</p>
                <p>On March 8th we heard the assignments were finally coming out. We were all
                    packed. We had our little swivel-wheel trailer and a funny apartment on 13th
                    Street and our things were ready. So the minute that letter came — that morning
                    we finished packing, drove to the State Department and I sat in the car while he
                    went in and signed the papers, and we left for our post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Mexico City.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't realized that was your first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I don't know what we'd have done if it had said we were going to
                    Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Maybe we got a letter that said we were going to Mexico; we must have
                    had to know something. Oh, well Tony took Spanish in 8th grade and he knew every
                    grammar rule there was, but I didn't know a word. I came from New England where
                    French was...if you learned anything, you learned French. In Mexico Tony just
                    couldn't understand how the cook could understand me. He used to shake his head
                    over me. But I was learning. I spoke miserably. Every language I spoke
                    miserably, but I communicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his assignment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: In those days every Foreign Service Officer went out to a first post
                    contiguous to the United States — Canada, Cuba, Mexico. I don't know how many
                    more places there were but they were all in embassies, I think. The new Foreign
                    Service Officers spent a month in Visas, a month in the Political Section, etc.
                    The embassies were very good about that. Tony spent a lot longer in the Consular
                    area than he did in the upper echelons of the Political Section, but all new
                    recruits had to learn all facets of the Foreign Service. Then they came back to
                    school in Washington. Now, you see, they go to school before they go out in the
                    field, but then they go out on a permanent assignment. We were just out a year
                    and came back to Washington. He was not considered a Foreign Service Officer
                    until he'd finished school. He could have been dropped at anytime up until then.
                    I think the school was three months long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have made it difficult moving backwards and
                        forwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, it was very interesting. By this time I had a baby. I wanted to have
                    a child as fast as possible because it was the only thing I could think of to
                    give my father. He saw her and loved her before he died. That's why I got
                    pregnant so fast, and I was the brunt of all the jokes in Mexico City because a
                    week after I missed my period I went to the doctor, sat in the office, and he
                    said, “Lady, you aren't pregnant. Come back in a month.” I said, “No, I'm sure
                    if you examine me you'll find I'm pregnant.” He examined me and said, “You're
                    six weeks pregnant.” I said, “No, I'm one week pregnant.” (I was right.) And he
                    said, “Well, I wouldn't know. I couldn't tell if you were one week pregnant.
                    You're at least six weeks pregnant.” That night we went to a cocktail party, and
                    I told everyone I was pregnant. I was so excited about it. I was the funniest
                    thing that came down the pike. I'll never forget that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, with baby and trailer you returned to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: No. We sold the car for $50.00 and a gun. It would have been impossible
                    to take the baby in that open car. It was a car that had tires in the fender
                    well — very chic looking. Ours was a 4-door touring car and it was in Night Must
                    Fall and several other movies. Tony earned money while he was in college by
                    renting the car to movie companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For reimbursement...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Right. For different movies, and Night Must Fall was a very famous one.
                    No, we came back by boat. That was a trip! First by train from Mexico City, down
                    to Vera Cruz and then by boat. I remember the cabin: you couldn't turn around in
                    it, that kind of thing. And we got to Cuba. Then we finally got to New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I don't remember. I know the baby was awfully sick from diarrhea — I'm
                    sure from all the changing of everything — but she survived. Then we had to stay
                    in Washington — everybody else went out on assignment by about the first of
                    April, but since language school didn't open in Peking — the Chinese language
                    school — we were kept in Washington until September.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>It was interesting how Tony got his assignment out of school, which I'm sure
                    wouldn't happen today. Everybody was waiting to see his name go up on the
                    bulletin board with his assignment, and eventually each person received his
                    assignment, and Tony's name remained absolutely blank. When he first came to
                    Washington to take the written, he went to the State Department, called on the
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, and said, “I want to know
                    how long it will take me to become a Chinese language officer after I pass the
                    exams.” And, of course, the Assistant Secretary, who was Max Hamilton, said,
                    “You just come back and see me after you've passed the exams.” So the minute
                    Tony passed the exams, the first thing he did when he got back to Washington was
                    to go and say, “Well, I passed the exam,” and he [Hamilton] said, “Wait until
                    you pass the orals.” Tony passed the orals and went right back up to the Far
                    Eastern division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had he acquired this interest? Having been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: He was an exchange student in the Lingham University, and he spoke
                    Cantonese. On his orals he put down Cantonese, and the State Department had to
                    really hustle to find somebody to give him the exam. (That's a wonderful story
                    that Jim Penfield will be glad to tell you about.) Anyway, he got 99 on his
                    Cantonese exam. So then Tony was getting really nervous and he'd come home and
                    say, “I don't understand.” Then we got an invitation from Max Hamilton,
                    Assistant Secretary of State, for dinner at his home.</p>
                <p>At the dinner there was much joking about how difficult it was to get with the
                    China service, but at the end of the dinner Max Hamilton got up to give a toast,
                    and to our great surprise and excitement he said, “We're gathered here tonight
                    to bring in a new member, and give Tony his assignment to the Far East — to
                    China, in Peking.” I tell you, it was incredible. I mean, here we were, just
                    nine months into our foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Extraordinary. I'm sure nobody else ever was given an
                        assignment that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: That's right, but it was because this boy, not yet a man even, kept
                    going right straight to the top and saying, “I want to be a Chinese language
                    officer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You remember who else was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Max Hamilton said, “We never have ever sent anybody as the Chinese
                    language officer who hasn't at least been in the Foreign Service for a year.”
                    But they never regretted it. Tony was the first Foreign Service Officer as an
                    interpreter to ever present the credentials of an American Ambassador. I mean,
                    they always had a Chinese do it. And Time Magazine called him “Fulton Faultless
                    Freeman” You know how Time Magazine always had an adjective for everybody.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: We had one child. She was still a baby and I guess she was still on the
                    bottle because we had that stupid sterilizer that we all used — those baby
                    bottles went in and you had to steam them for 15 minutes and the nipples would
                    get too soft. Anyway, I carried that to the ship's kitchen.</p>

                <p>FREEMAN: We stopped in Yokohama and the Niles Bonds were there ahead of us
                    because they'd gotten their assignment a good three months ahead of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I wanted to ask you about. Do you think that
                        as you went on in the Service you changed yourself a great deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: The qualities you need are very different now. I hope I grew. You grow
                    as you go along depending on your job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think are the qualities in those times as
                        distinct from now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: I think money facilitates a lot of problems. We didn't have any money.
                    I'm not saying that we were impoverished, but we had to live on the salary, and
                    we always owed the — what was the name of that place you could borrow money from
                    in the Department? The Credit Union. Our name was certainly there all the time,
                    which was marvelous for us. I must say we really couldn't have gotten along
                    without the help of the Credit Union.</p>
                <p>So, you're living carefully, in new territory. You really can be taken advantage
                    of when you don't speak the language well, and you don't know exactly what's
                    required in this particular post. I think one of our biggest problems was that
                    we were moved around so much in the beginning. It was very difficult. Then, of
                    course, the war came and then when we separated and Tony had to live too
                    so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I couldn't go anywhere except to Tony's family. My father had died just
                    before I left for Peking the first time... Do you want that first trip finished
                    before we go into this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I do want to go back to that but I would very much
                        like to hear what you have to say about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I think one has to have an interest. The people who will fail, in my
                    mind, are those who go with the attitude that there are only good Americans, and
                    bad foreigners and even that they're called foreigners when they're living in
                    their own land. Fortunately we don't have very many people like that, and
                    certainly not in the Foreign Service, though I've run into people who were
                    happier in some areas than in China, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was the embassy there? At that time — your first
                        post there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Not very big. In 1940 things were very insecure. The Japanese came in in
                    1937 and so the Japanese were in control of Peking, and then the war came and
                    [the embassy] moved to Nanking, then to Chungking, and stayed in Chungking
                    during the war. When we came back we were the first American family in the
                    consulate in Peking in 1946, and I was there just about two months before Jean
                    was born.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>But to go back to that [first] trip. Going out the first time we went to Yokohama
                    and were greeted by the Bonds and I took a ride with Julie leaving the baby on
                    the ship. I think she had only been driving about a week and the Japanese drove
                    on the right hand side and these military trucks were barreling down on us. And
                    I just knew this was the end, and my baby was going to be without a mother.
                    After that ride we went back to their house in the American consulate building
                    and I said, “Well, I guess I'd better go home, get back to the ship, take care
                    of my baby.” Everybody remonstrated but I went back, and then I fast learned
                    that Tony never got on a ship unless the gangplank was dangling, in air, you
                    know, that sort of thing. Oh, how many times people have wanted to put our
                    children off on the dock when we hadn't yet arrived and the ship was waiting,
                    ready to leave. But I learned that, so I usually went back first.</p>
                <p>From there we went to Kobe and changed to another ship, a smaller ship; went
                    through the Inland Sea and the Japanese took the three of us and put us in a
                    room with no windows. Oh, they were nasty to us going through customs. They took
                    away the diapers, they took away the baby food, they took away all our books.
                    They gave them back to us when we went out, but I mean things were really bad at
                    that point, in 1940, a whole year before the war. And all through the Inland Sea
                    we could hear all the banzais as the soldiers were getting on or off boats but
                    we didn't see the Inland Sea at all. I was very pleased to see the Inland Sea in
                    1981 finally.</p>
                <p>We went to Dairen and the Chases [he was the Consul there] and I'll never forget
                    her kindness because she knew my concern about leaving the baby at the hotel and
                    coming to their house for dinner, and I just blessed that woman because I was
                    beginning to think I was paranoid or something. But the scene was changing every
                    minute. There's nobody that you know there. You can't even talk to people in
                    their language. So it's a little hard to give up your baby to anybody. But Helga
                    [Chase] said, “I'm going to send my personal nursemaid who takes care of my
                    children, and I can assure you that she will stay right there, and if there's
                    any trouble she'll call us right away.” And I said, “Why don't you let me get
                    Midge to sleep because she'll sleep all night and I think everything will be
                    fine.” But I think since she was very much aware of the constant change, she
                    didn't like to get out of my sight. (I remember my mother-in-law calling me a
                    delinquent mother when I came home from all this because she said, “Well, I
                    can't understand why she cries all the time.”) So that was a wonderful
                    introduction and I just never forgot her kindness, both of them.</p>
                <p>Then we went on from Dairen, took a smaller boat. I stood there on the deck
                    watching hundreds of people going into the hold — I knew the whole boat was
                    going to turn over — then they shut the doors and we took off.</p>
                <p>We finally got to Tientsin, and I was really quite homesick between reaching
                    Yokohama and reaching Tientsin. But the minute I reached Tientsin I was
                    perfectly at home. Couldn't understand anything, but I knew that this was
                    finally where I was going to spend the rest of my life and everything went fine.
                    I put my feet on Chinese soil and said, “This is it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>When we finally got to Peking there was some trouble about daylight saving time
                    and nobody met us. We had fifty cases of food for the baby, and Tony got
                    everything into rickshaws. The funny part of it is that he said, “Oh, I'll look
                    it up in the phone book.” Well, I looked at the phone book and it was all
                    Chinese characters and he couldn't read it. That was so funny. I'll never forget
                    that.</p>
                <p>We didn't know where to go, so the rickshaw coolie took us to the American
                    embassy and we rang the doorbell and Jane Johnson came running down those stairs
                    — I can see her. It was a lovely looking residence — it had great wide stairs.
                    She said, “Oh, you must be the Freemans,” and opened up her arms and said, “It's
                    wonderful to see you. We should have met you.” But there'd been some mix-up. (I
                    doubt if she would have gone to the station.) And I thought, “Well, if I'm ever
                    going to be a good Foreign Service wife I think I'll emulate Jane Johnson [Mrs.
                    Nelson Joshnson, whose interview is also in the Foreign Service Spouse Oral
                    History Project collection] and Helga.” Everybody I'd met had been so kindly and
                    so thoughtful and to me that seemed the most important thing. The first two
                    nights we stayed in the embassy residence, and she said, “You don't have to come
                    down for dinner at all. You can just stay with Midge and do whatever you want
                    to. I'll send your dinner up because I know you're tired and I know you have to
                    get kind of acclimated and after that we'll go from there.” Her thoughtfulness.
                    She's always been a marvelous lady. Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you live in Peking the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: In a place called San Kuan Miau. That was a Chinese compound not far
                    from the main embassy compound. In the main embassy compound was a big house,
                    the embassy residence, and three rather big houses which looked like old post
                    offices built in 1900, about three stories high, and the office, the consulate.
                    Lovely big green sward of grass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have servants?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, yes. In the fall we moved into this Chinese compound: paper windows,
                    paper — not glass. Cold. You were never warm on both sides. If you had your back
                    to the fire you were burning and freezing. I think you could see your breath
                    every morning. But there were stoves in every room and, of course, no problem at
                    all. It was our wedding anniversary — had to be our second wedding anniversary.
                    Tony told the Chinese boy that he'd like a very nice dinner as it was our
                    wedding anniversary. I walked into that dining room — it had a silver
                    candelabra; it had a lace tablecloth. I mean that dining room was the most
                    gorgeous place I'd ever seen. We had the most elegant dinner from soup through
                    partridge and all. And that was all borrowed from everybody in the compound. Our
                    effects hadn't come. It just all appeared. And, of course, after we got our
                    stuff that also went to dinners and parties, but one never lost anything. If
                    somebody didn't have the proper cheese knife, why they found it, or whatever it
                    was that they needed. It was fantastic. We had a barren garden. It looked like a
                    lot of these lawns in Georgetown do. Pieces of grass coming up, not lawn. There
                    was a lovely moon gate, and there was some kind of rock path that went through,
                    but it was just awfully ugly. Nobody had done anything about it for a long time.
                    The morning of our wedding anniversary, I suppose, I got outside the front door
                    when I was going out with the baby, probably after her bath, and earlier Tony
                    had had it instantly planted with every kind of chrysanthemum. He'd seen the
                    coolie out there with all these plants and he said, “Plant it.” To see that
                    instant garden, I've never forgotten it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in the center of the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, it was within the Legation Quarter. It was not far from the city.
                    I mean we could walk to the markets and everything; not that I ever went to the
                    market in those days. It wasn't until '46 that I would. I knew enough Chinese by
                    that time to go to the market. But I didn't ever go to the market for food
                    shopping. The cook would never allow me to do it. He would have been so
                    insulted! But I went because I wanted to see the things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to divert for a moment, how were the servants paid?
                        Did you pay them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I guess if you were in the main compound the guards
                    were pretty well taken care of by...but I'm not even sure of that. I know that
                    we bought our own flowers and things. Our servants would do all the cleaning
                    around outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had somebody to take care of the baby if you
                        needed or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, I had an amah. We had a cook, a number one boy, a coolie who did
                    nothing but the fires. I bet we had six servants even when we were making $2500
                    a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this is one of the vast differences of course.
                        Salaries in those days were, shall we say, minimal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: By this time [Tony was] making $2700 because you did get raised in the
                    beginning there. Of course, then you stayed at about $3000 for quite a while
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. You were in [Peking] for a year at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: No. Oh, no. Much shorter. We got there in late September, just before
                    our anniversary, the 8th of October. Evacuation orders had already arrived, and
                    the people on the next boat to China were taken off at Honolulu. I just got
                    through the net, and for me it was marvelous because my idea of China was
                    Charlie Chan movies and beautiful art pieces that came over on the clipper ships
                    in New England. But between that...I really don't think I knew too much about
                    China. And so they couldn't wait to get rid of me because already the women were
                    packing to leave. But then the baby got very ill. I went to the crib one
                    morning. The amah called me. She was a lively pink and white baby. Just blue,
                    just nothing. So she went into the hospital, and she cried so much when I left
                    her that they said I couldn't see her anymore. So I'd sit out in the hospital.
                    I'd look through the crack in the door. It was terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, apparently paratyphoid. Where she got it I'll never know because I
                    was so careful about boiling everything. Of course I think you can also boil too
                    much. After she came home she had a relapse and she returned to the hospital. So
                    we missed the first boat on account of her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a Chinese hospital by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: It was the Rockefeller Hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was well established then in Peking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Yes. Do you know Penny [Johanson]?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I met her, yes. I know all about her.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: She and her six-week-old baby Rolph and Midge and I sailed back home on
                    New Year's Eve in 1941 together. And that started the long separation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you then separated, and where was Tony?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: From New Year's Eve of 1941 he didn't come home until August of '42 —
                    repatriated. They let him stay home three months and then they sent him back to
                    Chungking for the rest of the war. Then he returned on the day the atom bomb
                    fell on Hiroshima. He landed in San Francisco and went straight to a
                    hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course I know Tony played the trombone, from the
                        beginning, I assume. Where did he learn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: He was a very musical person and he started cello at the age of three or
                    four — a quarter-sized cello. All the people in Pasadena would see him going
                    with his cello on a bicycle and they always expected it to get smashed at some
                    point in going to his lessons. He decided at some point in high school that he
                    needed to earn some money and he wasn't earning any money with a cello. I think
                    he was in the symphony orchestra in Pasadena as a young person. He picked up a
                    bass because they needed a bass in this little group. They opened supermarkets,
                    opening night stand...floodlights...they always had music. Tony decided if he
                    could find a group like that, he'd be earning money, so he bought a bass viol.
                    He thought it was tuned exactly the same as the cello but, to his horror, he
                    found it wasn't, and he had to really work hard to be ready in twenty-four hours
                    for his first paid playing job. That's how he took up the bass, and it was a
                    very good jazz instrument. His trombone, I think, he'd had from early on. I
                    really don't know how young he was when he started the trombone, but that was
                    his love — although his cello always remained a very basic part of Tony's life.
                    He played in string quartets everywhere, played in the Peking Symphony
                    Orchestra. He played with [Walter] McConaughy [many time U.S. Ambassador and
                    specialist in Far Eastern Affairs], who played clarinet or something — they
                    played a lot together. Music meant a lot to Tony, and if he were depressed or
                    needed to think about things, he'd turn on his symphonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment out of the War College had been
                        Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, let me go back a little bit. When everybody was getting his
                    assignment — of course, the military got their assignments in January-February,
                    and the Foreign Service Officers never got their assignments until the day
                    before the school was ending. Although a few did, it dribbled along for those of
                    the Foreign Service Officers. And every party that we had at the War College,
                    after the assignments came out, people kept saying, “Well, where are you going?
                    Haven't you heard yet?” So once I said, “Oh, haven't you heard, we're going to
                    Rome?” And Tony said, “Oh, yes, haven't you heard, we're going to Rome.” Then
                    we'd laugh heartily and nothing more was said about it. I think people had
                    accepted the fact that we were going to Rome.</p>
                <p>So, when the first, either spoken commitment came out of the State Department —
                    whether it was written I'm not sure, I don't think it was written — I think Tony
                    was told that he was going to Berlin. We were really quite deflated because we
                    didn't know German; we had never had any. We couldn't find any real enthusiastic
                    connection with this, and we knew it would be a hard place for the children —
                    that sort of thing. And we might even have to anticipate more separation and
                    we'd already had more than our share. So we accepted it and never thought
                    anything about it. I wish I could think of who was assigned the head of the
                    mission at that time. Anyway, they called us and they were so pleased. We'd had
                    all this conversation and then we heard that we were going to Japan and we got
                    all excited about that. Then the written notice came and it said Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Tony and I decided that when the written paper came saying either Berlin
                    or Tokyo, people said, “This is a mistake, they're going to Rome.” They'd heard
                    it so often the papers probably went back into the mill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, for days like that again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, who knows? We never figured it out. We were so tickled about going
                    to Rome that, boy, we got ready and took off. We didn't want anybody to change
                    his mind again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Italian? You said you didn't speak German. How
                        about Italian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: We didn't speak any Italian but at least we'd both studied Latin, and we
                    knew some French. It just seemed much more — I mean Rome had such a ringing tone
                    to it. I think Rome and Paris are two places you must see before you die! So it
                    was very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there finally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Five years. We got there in August of '50 — August 15 I think it was —
                    summer vacation starts, everybody's gone, the streets were empty. Tony couldn't
                    wait to get back to work — it'd been so long, the War College period, and so on.
                    He was just like a stallion in the stable. He was ready to go. He literally
                    dumped us on the street at our pension and rushed to the embassy. He was so
                    excited. He came back the most dejected human being you ever saw. Well, Tommy
                    Thompson [Hon. Llewellyn E. Thompson, Jr., later Career Ambassador] was DCM
                    [Deputy Chief of Mission] at the time, and Tony waited quite a while to get in
                    to see him. It was a holiday but Tommy just happened to be in the office and
                    Tommy never got out of his chair, and he said, “Oh, Freeman. Heard you were
                    coming. Don't know what good you can do around here. You don't know Italian or
                    anything about Europe or the problems.” (Being in China.) Tony couldn't believe
                    it. I mean, the man didn't even shake his hand.</p>
                <p>So Tony went to work and he knew Italian in jig time: far better than a lot of
                    people who'd been there a longer time. And finally he was...within a very short
                    time given better and better assignments. But to me this was very significant of
                    the partitions in the Foreign Service. The European group didn't want anybody
                    getting into their line of fire, taking over a good assignment. At least that
                    was the feeling you definitely had in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were in Rome, of course, Mrs.
                        Luce was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: We had three wonderful ambassadors with us and three very different
                    ones. We had James Dunn, who was one of our distinguished ambassadors. They were
                    very formal, very frigid as far as the staff was concerned. For us it was a very
                    large post. In Peking it was always small, and Mexico never seemed big when we
                    were there. In SACLANT we were the only large fish in the pool and so Rome
                    seemed like a pretty big office. This was after the war and so they were
                    expanding. There were all those different organizations that were coming in
                    under the embassy shield. But Dunn was just there a very short time and then I
                    think he went to Spain as his last post.</p>
                <p>Then Ellsworth Bunker [Hon. Ellsworth Bunker, though not a career Foreign Service
                    Officer, held Ambassadorships to six countries and was twice Ambassador at
                    Large] came and he was only there 11 months, 5 days, 6 hours. He gave the exact
                    time when he gave his farewell, but those two came in there and tied up that
                    embassy in little red ribbons and there wasn't anybody, any of us right down to
                    the floor washer, that just didn't adore that couple. He had a marvelous ability
                    of bringing us together as a family and I'm sure it's never happened before. The
                    chancery, which was just a beautiful palace, was turned into the most fabulous
                    farewell party for those people. It was incredible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who arranged that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, the staff, DCM, I don't remember details but I mean the embassy
                    desks were all moved out and it became a palazzo (palace). It was a fabulous
                    evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they do that? Was it the combination of the two of
                        them together, or was it his personality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: She was a very shy and sweet New Englander, and I think he just quietly
                    smiled at all of us and said, “I know you'll give me your best,” and we sure
                    did. It was the height of cooperation, I think. Of course, we felt he was being
                    kicked out too, which was hard.</p>
                <p>And so Mrs. Luce came, and that has some very interesting stories. What a
                    beautiful woman she was. I have a marvelous letter from her that I've saved over
                    the years because Tony got kicked out of Rome. His brother was coming over for a
                    vacation. He'd just been divorced and he was very depressed. So we were planning
                    this vacation to cheer him up. Tony was working on the military agreements —
                    doing all the negotiating with Italy for our troops going through Livorno on up
                    to Austria and in that area. And one treaty hadn't been signed, but everything
                    had been agreed to. Mrs. Luce at that moment was going to the film festival in
                    Venice. Tony went to Durby, Elbridge Durbrow [later, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam]
                    and said, “Well, I can't go. Mrs. Luce said I can't leave.” And Durby said,
                    “Don't be silly. It's going to be signed and there's just no reason for you to
                    stay.” Of course Tony was very anxious to go and he knew he shouldn't have, but
                    he went. Mrs. Luce found out about it and sent in a request for his transfer. I
                    think she realized that she moved hastily, although Tony admitted that he should
                    not have gone. So she sent me a dozen roses the night before we left with this
                    letter which I will cherish always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general idea of the letter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: That she'd be visiting us someday in an embassy somewhere. She also
                    called Tony every time she ever touched down in the United States terra firma,
                    and it was quite funny, this whole aftermath. It wasn't much fun, I must say,
                    but we'd been there five years and it was time to go anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went then more or less directly to Brussels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, no. We came home to SACLANT, thanks to Mrs. Luce. That's why she
                    always called whenever she came home. “Well, how are you doing? Do you like the
                    job? I'll get you out of there, Tony.” She was a fascinating person.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No question about that. What about Mr. Luce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: He always sort of frightened me. He was always very stern and serious,
                    and lots of times I'd have to sit beside him and I'd almost freeze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he there a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I would say so, yes. I think he adored her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think he really played any role in her life as
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Something, but you certainly weren't aware of it. I thought she was very
                    courageous on many issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She left, on the whole, an irreplaceable impression as far
                        as the Italians were concerned, didn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: They were furious at her for — well, mostly for saying that she had been
                    poisoned. Tony firmly believed that she was allergic to the plaster droppings,
                    and he says he knows that it was diagnosed that way, but Tony was very loyal.
                    I'm not sure how I would stand on it, but the Italians didn't believe it at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it certainly must have been a lively time during the
                        time that she was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, it was. Well, of course, being in Italy is such a fantastic
                    opportunity — its history and beauty and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you ever find time to take advantage of being
                        there, though; because it seems to me that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Early on we learned that we could go on a weekend trip and pick out a
                    fourth class pension with the children. We knew how to carry our breakfast food
                    with us and picnic food. We needed a meal a day, so we found that we could
                    afford to do this and we'd just eat it up. One of our family projects was
                    beginning on Monday to decide what we'd do after church on Sunday. Everybody got
                    into the spirit of this thing down to the youngest child. There would be a
                    choice of where we'd go and what we'd see. So we covered a lot of territory in
                    five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that would be possible for that length of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: It was so amazing because our eldest child — she was 15 in Rome — and
                    one day I heard her — the children always came in and met people as all Foreign
                    Service children did — I heard her say, “Well, my parents never take me
                    anywhere.” And she had discovered Rome through her Latin teacher and her
                    schoolmates. It was the most exciting thing you ever saw because then they began
                    to go off in groups by themselves. But I was appalled to have my guests feel
                    that Tony and I never did anything. That's part of growing up in a family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the schooling, generally, there or elsewhere? Were
                        they in a local school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: In the American School. While we were there the PTA was started and I
                    was in on the beginnings of that. Then I helped organize the American Women's
                    Club in Rome. I went to Mrs. Luce, asked her permission, and she said, “Yes.”
                    Now that's one of the biggest Women's Clubs in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I am aware that you were very active in Brussels. Of
                        course, a number of years before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I don't remember doing anything in depth in the Women's Club in
                    Brussels, but I did go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember that very well. The American Women's Club
                        in Rome, for example, had many members of the business community, the
                        resident community of Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Also Italians — starting out — because a lot of the Women's Clubs
                    excluded the natives of the country and that was our main purpose, that this
                    would be working together with the Italians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do a great deal of good works in the course of the
                        time you were there, whether in Rome, Brussels, Colombia and Mexico City,
                        and so on? Do you have any recollection of being involved in lots of
                        charitable activities and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Oh, yes. I worked very hard for the Nursery School in Colombia, and I
                    helped with the organization of the Women Volunteers of Colombia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a new concept as far as Colombia was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: As the national thing, and that's going very well now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the American community take a very active part in that
                        kind of concept, in bringing that concept into reality? Or were there other
                        nationalities that were involved with it, particularly Americans who were
                        involved in these charitable activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was always interested in how that had come about;
                        whether that was just a spontaneous thing that arose in individual places,
                        or whether it was something that Americans generally carry with them, women
                        particularly perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, I think that for the Latin women, they do their little things
                    through their church for the most part and that would sort of allow them in a
                    limited way — a lot of them have huge families — I mean speaking about Spanish
                    or French or Italian — and I always felt that going into these organizations was
                    my one way of getting to know the country, getting to meet people of the
                    country, and facilitating my knowledge of the language too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your Italian work out finally, starting from
                        your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I've never been a good linguist, never. I think that — of course, we had
                    to literally forget our Italian when we finally got to Colombia, but I'm sure
                    each one of those learning processes helped me on the next one. Of course, I
                    speak Spanish better than any other language that I've learned or that I've
                    studied. But I always falter along. I also understood what was going on, and in
                    Colombia I remember returning to Colombia with Tony after we'd retired, and all
                    of my old friends got together for a tea party to see me, and they said, “My,
                    your Spanish has improved so.” I thought I spoke wonderful Spanish when I was in
                    Colombia, so my feelings were quite hurt!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That leads me to another question I wanted to be sure to
                        ask you. Were you and Tony perhaps unique in maintaining friendships with
                        the people with whom you were associated in the country wherever you were,
                        as well as with other nationalities, diplomatic groups?</hi>

                <p>FREEMAN: Well, I was terrible about keeping up things. It just got bigger and
                    bigger and it got almost too much to handle. But we've kept up with a few.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find your associations with Americans become
                        stronger over the years, those with whom you've shared, or is your life now
                        on the West Coast so different and so exciting in itself as far as I can
                        make it out to be, that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: That's a difficult question. I think I would be very sad if I couldn't
                    come back to Washington and see some old friends and talk to people who knew
                    Tony. That's very important to me — being able to talk about Tony. My life in
                    California was so short with Tony, in a way, that that's kind of just another
                    life. It's a nice life because it's a family life; my main interests are my
                    children and my grandchildren, and that's giving me a great deal of pleasure.
                    But to come back here and see all of you is part of my living. I think I will
                    return. I have such a desire to live. I'm always grateful to anybody who stops
                    in to see me in California, in Carmel.</p>

                        those marvelous qualities that we were starting to talk about yesterday?
                        Certainly you said flexibility was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I think one of the joys of the Foreign Service is that each person is
                    such an individual and there's so many kinds of good Foreign Service Officers,
                    and probably what's great, at least in the past, which I think is probably
                    diminishing now, is that we all worked as a team and as a group, and now with
                    the separation of working wives, terrorist problems and that kind of thing, it
                    must be harder to have the same kind of relaxed enjoyment of each person's best
                    qualities. We can look for the bad qualities, but the best qualities, I think,
                    are brought out in most of us.</p>

                        sharing of experiences that must have been characteristic of not only a

                <p>FREEMAN: Well, I think it's amazing how any post — I'm sure that's even true
                    today — is really overall controlled by the personality of the chief officer
                    and/or his wife.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which reminds me, the Burdens [Hon. William A.M. Burdens,
                        non-career Ambassador to Belgium when Fulton Freeman was Deputy Chief of
                        Mission] were in Brussels when you were there and that must have been again
                        a very happy experience as far as the relationship between you and
                        them.</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: I don't think it was ever very close. I was sure...I think that he
                    distrusted Tony in a way in the beginning. Now whether he would have distrusted
                    anybody or whether he just distrusted Tony...but Tony had a hard time in the
                    beginning working with him. Mr. Burden, of course, had always been a very
                    independent person and Tony was finding out that he was going to Paris for
                    dinner and staying for the week without even telling Tony. Those were hard times
                    too... Tony would say, “Please, sir, just tell me when you're leaving the
                    country.” But I don't think Mr. Burden thought of it as leaving the country, he
                    was just going out for the weekend. I think Mrs. Burden is a lovely, lovely
                    person.</p>
                <p>If new Foreign Service wives could really sit down and decide the importance, for
                    instance, of making a balance between their family and career — from the
                    beginning, knowing that they won't be dragged off the path of this or put back
                    on the path of that. I think I just grew up like Topsie in the Foreign Service
                    and made certain rules for myself out of necessity. I never played bridge, for
                    instance, in the afternoon, ever. I was home when the children came home unless
                    it was a command performance.</p>
                <p>Now I've asked the children — they're no longer children obviously — my girls, if
                    they remember that I was home because I find that their recollections and my
                    recollections are very different and they think of me as mostly being out. But I
                    was there and obviously they brought home friends to play with and played with
                    people in the building, but they don't remember my being there. So I'm not sure
                    what's important, but I do feel that there are certain things you just have to
                    say no to if you have a family at a certain period, and you shouldn't ever have
                    a guilty conscience about it, nor should you be made to have a guilty
                    conscience.</p>

                    just wasn't firm enough sometimes, although changing posts as often as we did, I
                    refused to go out for the first three or four or five days depending on the
                    children's feelings of the instability and Tony had to go. I mean that was
                    something I laid down. Now whether that was my own insecurity or not, who
                    knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that one had the impression that in the earlier
                        days in the Foreign Service, which of course I had some taste myself, the
                        ability of wives to choose what they would either contribute in the way of
                        charitable activities or in terms of social activities, was very
                        limited.</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: I felt strongly by the time I got to Mexico, which was our last post,
                    and many of the wives at that time didn't want to come to those wives' meetings
                    which we had, and I felt very strongly that the wives' meetings had a use for
                    those people who had trouble learning the language and getting outside of the
                    group and needing the group. But I certainly do feel that anybody that didn't
                    want to come should not be made to feel that she was being delinquent in her
                    duty. A couple of wives came to me and said, “I really can't come; I'm going to
                    university and taking courses,” — or doing this — and I said, “That's fantastic;
                    you're widening the opportunity of our whole embassy.” And I said, for instance,
                    to a couple of them that were going to the university, “Well, invite some of the
                    students to the residence. Anytime you want to do something in the residence, it
                    gives us a chance to get to know somebody else, and that's just as much a part
                    of the job as anything else.” I encouraged people to go their own way. As far as
                    making brownies, those [wives] have long since tired of that. At that point
                    there was all the beginnings, I think, of a wives' thing: “Well, I deserve to be
                    paid too.” I couldn't have agreed with them more in many ways, because my day
                    began at 7:00 and usually ended at 1:00 the next morning. Especially without the
                    children there I didn't have any excuses to do anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your days filled largely, in recollection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I started playing golf in Bogota and Mexico City because that gave me
                    four hours out in the fresh air. I loved it for that. I'm not a sportswoman and
                    never spent any time at it, but that to me was a marvelous release and I still
                    enjoy it. The golf course is always a beautiful place no matter what country
                    it's in — peaceful, quiet. But my day started in the morning because we didn't
                    have a chef, couldn't afford highly paid servants.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>It's kind of an interesting story in Mexico because once we got there, Tom Mann
                    had taken the cook home with him, and I said, “This is impossible — to come to a
                    post this size and not have any help in getting the staff put together. I'm just
                    not going to put up with a cook under these circumstances — of entertaining.”
                    Well, we couldn't find a chef. In that particular time there was a great opening
                    of all these restaurants. It was a kind of period of expansion and chi-chi
                    restaurants. I mean if you'd paid a million dollars you couldn't have gotten a
                    chef. So one day this little girl appeared and she had only cooked for a family
                    of five and she had two girls, her husband had abandoned her, and she had a very
                    determined look in her eyes, and she said, “I would like the job; I need it.” I
                    said, “Well, it's going to be a hard job because I'll have to teach you and
                    you're going to have to really do what I say.” So she started and she couldn't
                    cook anything outside of tortillas, beans, very, very simple family food. For
                    example, I tried to teach her how to make crepes and she wouldn't believe me
                    that those crepes had to mature for a couple of hours before you cook them. I
                    remember we had Ambassador [Robert Charles] Hill for lunch. It was the worst
                    meal I've ever eaten. Hill had tried to get Tony out of the Service and it was
                    almost as if I had tried to kill him. It was awful. I've never forgotten that
                    meal. Anyway, as time went on, I said, “You're not going to get much chance here
                    so that if you don't get to work...” I said, “I'll promise you that you will end
                    up the highest paid cook in Mexico City if you do what I tell you to do.” When I
                    returned to Mexico in 1976 or '77 she was leaving the American Embassy to go to
                    one of the richest families at the highest salary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a marvelous story. And you taught her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Well, I taught her a lot. I sent her to cooking school. I sent her down
                    to Acapulco for a course in cooking. I really worked hard at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you learn to cook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I learned by reading the books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that went beyond that, because really I can remember
                        meals in Europe in your house, your home...Well, whatever it was, it was
                        superb and I always had the feeling that it was somebody who had been taught
                        by you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I never cooked growing up at all because I was brought up by
                    housekeepers and they never wanted children in the kitchen, and then I was away
                    at boarding school. But I just realized that you had to learn how to cook, and
                    so I began collecting cook books and reading — that was my nightly reading for a
                    long time — and the only reason I knew that you had to keep the batter of crepes
                    for a while in the refrigerator was because I'd read it and could easily see how
                    tough they were if you didn't do that. So that's how I learned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: That was right. After all, you spent a lot of time eating in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think that people realize that, how much time is
                        spent around a table lifting a fork and knife.</hi>

                <p>FREEMAN: I know...lifted them too often, believe me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had this kind of thing, you had lunches, as well as
                        dinners, cocktail parties as well as receptions, all that sort of thing, of
                        mingling with other personalities, other nationalities. That was constant as
                        far as your life was concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: We entertained 10,000 people a year in Mexico; that was recorded. And
                    heaven knows how many other people dropped in. That's a lot of people. When I
                    came home I wouldn't even go out; I'd had it. In a way I think that's why I
                    haven't kept up with people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that even the most adaptive, gregarious come to a
                        point where it's no longer...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I think even Tony longed for the quiet of our home. Well, it's a great
                    life...</p>
                <p>[To go back to China] I got out there [Peking] and the only place was the
                    Methodist Mission Hospital and there was no anesthesia. Nothing. I mean they
                    didn't even have x-ray plates. It was really at the bottom of the pit. So I was
                    lined up with all the Chinese ladies who were about to give birth. This was the
                    first time Tony'd ever been around. The first child he didn't know he had for a
                    week. He was in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. And this second child he didn't see
                    until she was over two years old, and had forgotten what name we were going to
                    give her. I never let him forget that.</p>
                <p>And so the third is now being born in Peking in '45 and they never made a sound,
                    these Chinese women, and if ever I let out a moan I'd say, “Oh, excuse me,” in
                    Chinese. I held Tony's hand so hard that he couldn't move it for a week. And
                    when I got into the delivery room they gave me a little piece of cotton with
                    some chloroform on it. But that was a wonderful experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The biggest compliment that I ever got from Tony was shortly after the baby was
                    born (we were supposed to have gone to a dinner party that night and, of course,
                    I interrupted the schedule) but Tony went to the dinner party. So our hostess,
                    who was quite an intellectual, chatted with me on the street shortly after this,
                    and she said, “You know really Tony was such a bore the night your baby was
                    born.” She said, “I never knew that every single subject could return to the
                    birth of a baby.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think that's lovely. Great compliment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: I think that's wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you spoke yesterday about your good fortune in having
                        a strong constitution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Like a horse. I never really got the intestinal things that most people
                    had at some time or another. I was tough as an ox. That's a good attribute for
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>That was another thing I was thinking about — terrorism and evacuation. A lot of
                    people think that's just going on today. It's worse today and it's a lot more
                    obvious today, but this was going on in my early time of the Foreign Service,
                    but it was never so widely spoken about because the media didn't have that and
                    neither were there telegraphic connections that quickly.</p>
                <p>But I can remember when the Mexican pilot crashed in the Potomac in 1940, or '39
                    I guess it was, and the Mexicans became very irate about this and there was a
                    big demonstration because they felt that they'd been sabotaged on our part. The
                    only thing we really owned in those days was that Ford touring car and Tony
                    called me up and said, “Quick, come get it, it's in front of the consulate,
                    because they're coming to demonstrate.” So I rushed down to get the car to
                    rescue our only concrete possession. Then in '46-'47 we filled our bathtubs
                    constantly with water: kept them filled, because the Communists surrounded
                    Peking and at any time could cut off the water supply, electricity, and the
                    trains were, of course, cut quite constantly between Tientsin and Peking.</p>
                <p>Then one night President Lleras Camargo in Bogota called the house, personally,
                    and got Jean on the phone and said, “Your father's in danger. Where is he? We've
                    got to find him.” Well, that poor child never got over that. That was a terrible
                    thing. She was fourteen or something like that, but she remembers that with just
                    terror. But Tony, of course, would not take precautions. He said, “No, if the
                    United States has to be represented somewhere, I'll be there.” So we had that
                    kind of [thing]. At least you were beginning to live under clouds at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>When we went to Mexico, in 1964 during the Cuban Crisis, I was incarcerated in
                    the house — by my own volition and Tony's — because they had secret service
                    people, and if I went out I had to be followed. I knew that was a ridiculous
                    thing to do. Of course, I snuck out the back door once or twice because that
                    feeling of incarceration is a terrible thing. I feel so sympathetic toward
                    people who have to go through this crisis, all of mine being very minor, but I
                    got a taste of it.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, during the Olympics in Mexico, they put a telephone in my car
                    and I was only to go on certain routes, and they wished that they had the money
                    to give me a chauffeur but that wasn't possible...but I did have the use of a
                    telephone. They'd call me and say there's demonstrators here, or don't go there,
                    so that even at that time and all through our...had gone through certain
                    things.</p>
                <p>Then there were lots of demonstrations in Italy, pounding on our gates at the
                    Palazzo Margarita, and I learned then that when we read about a demonstration
                    there, that that demonstration is within a 5-block area. I think the thing about
                    terrorism today is that you don't know whether the bomb is in your plane or your
                    coat closet or something — but somehow terrorism in my day was confined to a
                    small area and linked to destruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Confined and defined...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: And you could always skirt the area. The Inspection Corps and because of
                    the age of our children, well, I should regress a bit. I thought that if Tony
                    took that assignment [in the Inspection Corps] then maybe we could afford to put
                    our children in boarding school, but that was very naive of me, because when I
                    looked into it I realized that it was a very expensive operation, and therefore
                    quickly gave it up, and we had one child in college at that time. So, obviously,
                    I had to stay here in the States, but I always felt that we'd had quite enough
                    separation so I decided that...I'd always questioned whether I'd be able to take
                    care of the children if anything ever happened to Tony. And he did get very ill
                    in 1950 and I was really quite worried — and, of course, we went through the
                    McCarthy period, and Tony and I said, “Well, at least we could pump gas in a gas
                    station if we'd gotten let out of the Service.” It was kind of a family joke.
                    But it was always in the back of my mind. What would happen and could I do
                    anything, because until you've passed a certain period in the Foreign Service
                    you have no pension whatsoever and I suppose it would have been minimal if
                    anything happened before those years had passed. So I was always fascinated to
                    know if I had it in me to do anything. So I studied for the real estate exam
                    (which seemed to be the only thing that I could do and be home with my girls
                    when they came home from school). And I passed the real estate exam, sold one
                    house, and then off I went to visit Tony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope it was a big house.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: No, it was a very tiny house. And that was another thing I didn't like;
                    they always seem to show everybody big houses and not what they could afford,
                    and this was a young Foreign Service Officer and his wife and they were just
                    starting out. And so I tried to show them the kind of house that I felt they
                    could start with and that was well built. I often wondered how long they kept
                    it.</p>
                <p>Oh, dear...the effect of the McCarthy period and how in a way it dogged Tony's
                    path for so long. Even at the end he wanted to go back to the Far East. Part of
                    his heart was always there, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think people who didn't live through that period
                        can imagine what the consequences were like for the people who were having
                        to live through that, in terms of the psychological effect...the clouds that
                        hung over so many people in that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: We took Jack Service out of a terrible hotel room, you know [John S.
                    Service was one of the “China Hands” persecuted by Senator McCarthy.]. Had to
                    walk up five flights. We made him come live with us. And that changed our life
                    considerably because from that time on...Tony would always say, “Oh, they're
                    friends of ours.” I'd say, “Tony, they are not friends of ours, they are
                    acquaintances of ours.” I measured friendship by an entirely different balance
                    after that. In a way I suppose I ended up with fewer friends than most people,
                    but my definition of friendship became very, very purified. At one time you
                    could have counted our friends on less than a whole hand. Well, it was a
                    terrifying thing — and frustrating.</p>
                <p>Your interesting question was the coping with the isolation and removal from the
                    United States mainstream while serving abroad. I found that very interesting
                    when I came back from Peking in '48. People weren't ever really interested in
                    what... They'd ask you one or two leading questions, but they hardly ever waited
                    to hear the whole answer. I can remember feeling that I also had lost touch with
                    what was going on and it made me much more aware that I should constantly keep
                    certain reading up. But you have a tendency, one has a tendency I think, and I'm
                    sure it's pretty widespread, that if you are in an isolated situation... In
                    Peking we were cut off from the world to a certain extent; radio was our only
                    contact and radios weren't awfully good, lots of static. In Rome, you had a much
                    different situation. You could get European newspapers, American papers, so that
                    your world opens up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I suppose there were many Americans who came and, of
                        course, whom you saw in quantity I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>FREEMAN: And we had fascinating evenings. Mrs. Luce was marvelous at
                    that...anytime anybody came through. We met Tom Dewey and Harriman — the whole
                    spectrum — and marvelous conversation. The wives were allowed to come...but not
                    to open their mouths. But it was fascinating; I didn't mind at all just being
                    the fly on the wall because we learned a lot.</p>
                <p>But think of the number of posts in our Foreign Service that are isolated — even
                    in this day and age. I imagine this would be true in Africa, and certainly lots
                    of places in Latin America. So there is a certain coping with isolation that I
                    don't think is talked about enough.</p>
                <p>I don't think that holidays abroad are that bad. You quickly have a family of one
                    kind or another — foreign students, Peace Corps people. We always had a big
                    table at Thanksgiving and Christmas that included all kinds of people and we
                    started singing, caroling, in hospitals beginning in China when the children
                    were very small and always did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the family or gathering of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FREEMAN: Gathering people together to do it. Well, to me the holidays mean family
                    but it isn't necessarily near family. It means international — and I never felt
                    lonely I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the characterizations that has struck me so
                        forcibly — reading descriptions of Foreign Service life, for example. I
                        don't know whether you're familiar with a book called Diplomat by Charles
                        Thayer [Charles W. Thayer, Diplomat, New York, Harper Brothers, 1959]. It's
                        about American diplomats primarily, although it's a description of
                        diplomatic life in general. I was struck by the fact that the only word that
                        he used to describe wives was “boredom,” and I was the more struck by it
                        when you said yesterday that you thought that having an interest in what was
                        going on around you was the most important thing that you could think of as
                        being an attribute of Foreign Service wives. He was referring to, I think,
                        the period of the fifties and his description of life in the Foreign Service
                        at that time included the fact that one of the reasons there were so many
                        parties was that wives needed to be diverted.</hi>

                <p>Talk given by Phyllis Freeman to Kappa Kappa Gamma Fraternity (sic) at the

                    1984.</p>
                <p>It is almost forty-five years ago that I began that great experience on the
                    coattails of a fascinating man who was full of life and spirit, who wished to
                    investigate every nook and cranny of the world around him and to experience to
                    the fullest the advances and changes of our time and to be a part of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>“From Mexico to Mexico in 25 years” should be the title, for that was both our
                    first and last post. It was exciting, overwhelming, terrifying, challenging, and
                    never-ending in its variations. From a sleepy giant which was Mexico in 1938,
                    the glamor and strangeness of China, the ageless beauty and exuberance of Italy,
                    the sophistication and stolidity of Belgium, the simplicity and hardship of
                    living in the magnificence of nature-in-the-raw of Colombia, and back again to
                    the dignity and pride of a great culture living in Uncle Sam's shadow — a
                    country of contrasts, Mexico. In between these assignments there was always
                    Washington, which in itself will always fascinate me.</p>
                <p>We drove from Washington to Mexico City in early 1939 in a right-hand-drive
                    touring car with our few goods and chattels in a swivel wheel trailer. In order
                    to receive the few cents a mile allowed in those days we had to complete 350
                    miles per day. Now that's a morning drive, I can assure you that then it was
                    not. Often we had motor or tire trouble and then had to drive long into the
                    night to keep our schedule. If any of you have driven on the improved road from
                    Tomasncharlie to the Mexican plateau in the daytime, you may have been as
                    overcome as I when, 25 years later, I saw what we had done in the dark of night
                    and fog.</p>
                <p>Because of my uncertain health during my first pregnancy I flew to Los Angeles,
                    on an unpressurized plane, in my eighth month. At that time the new codes were
                    being distributed to the Consulates. Since I was to land at towns where we had
                    posts I was given the duty of delivering them in person to the Consulate. By
                    this time war had started in Europe, our old codes now broken. My mission was
                    the 1939 version of carrying around the secrets of the atomic bomb. Imagine
                    letting a pregnant wife carry secrets in our world today! Our couriers go with
                    locked cases chained to their wrists.</p>
                <p>The day our daughter was six weeks old I flew back to Mexico with her, the first
                    time alone with my child and without the advice of my mother-in-law. We hit bad
                    weather and the pilot came out of the cockpit to tell me that he would fly as
                    low as possible to insure the safety of the baby and the passengers — if I would
                    “keep her asleep, it would be better,” he said. I froze with Midge asleep on my
                    shoulder. Everyone was very ill from lack of oxygen but I had risen to the cares
                    of motherhood. On landing, my husband's greeting was that he had heard of people
                    turning green but that he had never seen one before.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Our first violence came at this time. Sarabia, the pride of Mexico's air force,
                    had flown to Washington and on landing had missed the tarmac and drowned in the
                    Potomac. There were headlines and cries of sabotage and angry crowds marching on
                    the embassy. Our only possession, aside from our wedding presents, was our car
                    and it was parked at the embassy. I got a call from Tony to please come quickly
                    to rescue it. He was busy with the rest of the staff securing the embassy. I
                    tell you this story because we think of violence as an aspect of today's world,
                    not inherent in those days. Now news travels faster, crowds are bigger — there
                    are a lot more of us on this planet — and the Foreign Service has always known
                    that we were expendable. The Senate decreed a long time ago that the family of a
                    Foreign Service Officer went at his pleasure to a post, not the pleasure of the
                    government. This is a little-known fact until one comes up against IRS in a
                    deduction for broken furniture or a complete loss of one's effects.</p>
                <p>On to China then, where my husband's dream was to be a specialist in the area and
                    the language. Our first greeting at the station in Peking was, “Too bad you've
                    come such a long way to turn around to go home again.” Evacuation orders for all
                    unnecessary personnel had arrived. Three months later, after two bouts of
                    paratyphoid and having the baby turn blue from overdosages of sulfa (the miracle
                    drug which saved so many of our soldiers in the war), we were ready to try again
                    to catch a boat from Shanghai to San Francisco.</p>
                <p>For two or three days I had not been well but I was afraid that if I missed
                    another boat it would be bad for Tony's record — difficult family! However, as
                    time neared to leave for the boat I became alarmed at my symptoms so I took a
                    rickshaw to the hospital to find out just what was the matter. The emergency
                    bells clanged and a doctor, who by then had me on the operating table, was
                    glowering down at me saying, “Didn't you realize that if you tried to get on the
                    boat you would be dead?” I said, “But no one knows I'm here. No one else knows
                    my baby's formula.” Giving the baby's formula was the last thing I remembered
                    for some time. I awoke to the chattering of a Chinese girl who was delighted to
                    have a captive student of Chinese. I shall never forget those ten days. Midge
                    and I finally sailed home on New Year's Eve of 1941.</p>
                <p>Tony was incarcerated on December 7 by the Japanese, who were then in control of
                    North China. After 28 months of separation, he was repatriated. After four
                    months at home he was sent back to Chungking. He returned to the U.S. on the day
                    the atom bomb fell on Hiroshima. We were, of course, going to have a few
                    luxurious days to ourselves before I introduced him to his daughters. We had
                    reservations at La Playa, Carmel, California.</p>
                <p>I shall never forget the kindnesses of the staff there. Tony became very ill. Six
                    feet tall, he had come home weighing 130 pounds. The staff helped me bed him
                    down in the back of the car and I drove him from Carmel to the Pasadena hospital
                    where he remained for three weeks. He met Carol, our second daughter, for the
                    first time when she was over two years old. I had driven myself to the hospital
                    in Pasadena in the middle of the night for her birth.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>After a short time in Washington we headed back to Peking once more. We had to
                    find our own transportation and it took weeks, through the War Shipping Board,
                    to find a boat. We finally left on a tanker loaded with aviation gas. That trip
                    is a story unto itself. It was written up by a Chilean who was on his way to
                    Shanghai as consul and to practice medicine. He saved my third daughter by
                    giving me confidence, since there was no doctor on board the ship. I realized
                    that I should not have put into jeopardy the lives of two young children and one
                    unborn child, but I had had enough of separation! Jean was born five months
                    later in a Chinese hospital where the only medication was a piece of cotton with
                    a drop of ether. Not a sound from the Chinese ladies in the same condition, so I
                    upheld the honor of the United States and practically drank in the cotton.</p>
                <p>Two years later: returning home a few months before all the Americans left China
                    we had three years in Washington, where the strain of McCarthyism and the
                    uncertainty of losing one's head the next day was a period of heartache for our
                    friends and for us. We, the China service, had “lost China.”</p>
                <p>Then we were assigned to Rome, and the rest of Tony's career really pivoted at
                    this moment on the fact that C. B. Luce was sent to Italy to be our Ambassador.
                    She could not understand why Tony was not promoted. She found him to be a loyal
                    American, a fine Foreign Service Officer, and sent a telegram to Ike telling him
                    just that. It was a lucky day for us, but a lot of our friends were scarred for
                    life.</p>
                <p>From there it was SACLANT as Political Advisor, to Belgium as Deputy Chief of
                    Mission, and the crowning ambition of any Foreign Service Officer — as
                    Ambassador to a Class Two post, Colombia, in 1961. I must admit to you now,
                    although I would not have been so candid years ago, that we were not quite sure
                    just where in South America Colombia was. But after we lived there, Colombia
                    became and always will be a special place to us and our family. The excitement
                    of Latin America and John Kennedy — the Peace Corps, where the very first group
                    arrived — the feeling that, at last, South America was being thought important
                    to the USA, a genuine interest.</p>
                <p>The fervor of Kennedy's visit to Bogota is hard to describe without superlatives.
                    Over a million people lined the streets. Unfortunately the President had a fever
                    by the time he arrived from Venezuela, and President Lleras Camargo — one of the
                    world's great statesmen, by the way — insisted that the schedule be cut to save
                    the President's energies. We had a six-hour lunch in the Presidential Palace
                    with the two presidents, their wives, the Colombian Ambassador to the United
                    States and his wife and ourselves. I can assure you John Kennedy made me proud
                    he was our President. He was impressive in his intelligence, his humor and his
                    understanding of problems.</p>
                <p>One bit of trivia: I felt I did not have sheets of presidential quality — they
                    were to take over our bedroom — so I asked Tish Baldridge (now the Emily Post of
                    today) to please send me a pair of sheets which Jackie would feel comfortable
                    sleeping on. They arrived posthaste. The bill was $95.00.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>John Kennedy's death put a pall over Colombia for months. It was real; they had
                    lost a very close friend. The night he was killed we received people at the
                    embassy until three in the morning. The lines of people to sign the book were
                    endless day after day and made up of all kinds of people from many walks of
                    life, from cathedrals to small parishes in the hinterland.</p>
                <p>In March, 1964, we were assigned to Mexico. We were excited of course, it was a
                    challenge we hadn't dared dream of. At the same time we hated leaving Colombia.
                    We had made many real friends, who are still special in my life today. Mexico is
                    very different from Colombia, its problems more sophisticated, more complicated,
                    the position of the American Ambassador delicate.</p>
                <p>So with trepidation but happy memories of that first trip years ago, we drove in
                    a Lincoln Continental convertible over the same route, shadowed from the border
                    by the Mexican police. If we stopped to look at a view, they stopped to ask if
                    we were all right, did we need something? And so we arrived — at the biggest
                    U.S. embassy in the world — to the visit of the Dutch Queen, the visit of Prince
                    Philip, the Cuban Missile Crisis, three Presidential visits, and one
                    vice-presidential visit when Mr. Humphrey entertained the Mexican President in
                    our embassy — the first time a Mexican President had set foot on American
                    territory in Mexico; two family weddings (one of which almost ended in tragedy),
                    my husband's heart attack, the Olympics, and a bombing. By the end of our five
                    years we had entertained 50,000 people. One of my biggest jobs was to find an
                    appropriate new residence, the one in the Zona Rosa long ago having worn out its
                    usefulness. I am sure some of you have visited the new residence. I think it is
                    functional as well as beautiful.</p>
                <p>Interlaced through the years were the problems of running a house in a foreign
                    language. Servants become family and their problems become yours. With 14
                    servants in Mexico, each having a large family, it took part of my time every
                    day. There were illnesses, accidents and problems that even “the soaps” “One Day
                    at a Time” or “As the World Turns” couldn't dream up.</p>
                <p>And there were projects — charity work, raising funds, teas, coffees, meetings,
                    menu planning, guest lists, table seatings, flower arranging, clothes planning,
                    protocol. Fortunately the children have grown up before one reaches these
                    demands, but one has to plan family life in the Foreign Service. This makes for
                    special moments, special days, and special vacations, such as, I'm sure, working
                    parents have to achieve today.</p>
                <p>As we lived on three continents, mores and folkways changed; the markets and the
                    menus. People laugh at protocol but protocol is a way of living with different
                    peoples. It gives everyone the same base from which to proceed, it simplifies
                    our lives and gives us a framework we all understand. Formal calls, for example,
                    give us a chance to make our first contacts in the new city.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Recently in Washington, Ambassador [Paul] Boeker, then head of the Foreign
                    Service Institute, told me they are having trouble filling the jobs abroad.
                    Wives are staying home while their husbands go to post. He said, “Somehow we
                    will have to compensate the Foreign Service wife.” That certainly is a new world
                    hard for me to understand, for I had the best job and the great opportunity of
                    working alongside my husband for 30 years!</p>
                <p>During those years we had the opportunity to meet important people, always
                    appealing. We began with the Roosevelts — Eleanor Roosevelt will ever remain at
                    the top of my life, a magnificent lady. We met Congressmen, Senators, writers,
                    actors, musicians — and in the latter category I think Tony, a bass and trombone
                    player, would put Satchmo and Duke Ellington and Herb Alpert at the top of his
                    list.</p>
                <p>To mention only a few by name: Adlai Stevenson, Archibald and Ada MacLeish, Walt
                    Disney, Robert Kennedy, Helen Hayes, Dolores Del Rio, Joan Crawford. There were
                    many more. The great ones stand out as warm, loving and considerate. The others
                    were only momentarily important.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your interest. THE END</p>
