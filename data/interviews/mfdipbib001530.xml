                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the third of February, 1999, and this is an
                        interview with Harlan Cleveland. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. This is being
                        done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.
                        Harlan, could you start out by telling us when and where you were born and
                        something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I was born in the middle of New York City, in 1918. The war was still
                    going on, the First World War. My father at that time was an Army chaplain, but
                    his profession was being an Episcopal minister and actually an Episcopal student
                    chaplain by trade. Shortly after I was born, he was the Episcopal student
                    chaplain at Princeton University, and then he moved to the University of
                    Wisconsin, in Madison, and wound up in charge of a complex of Episcopal
                    operations there: a boys school and a sisterhood, where he died when I was eight
                    because he was gassed during the war. He never really recovered from that.
                    Although he had these jobs, he was, we gather, deteriorating pretty rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of this? I mean, what sort of a figure was
                        he for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I remember him with white hair, which didn't seem to be very
                    astonishing at the time. I knew he had to be terribly old, if he was my father.
                    He actually died when he was 36, I think. The people at the hospital said they
                    couldn't believe he wasn't in his 60s, at least. I don't have a very clear
                    recollection of him. My brother and I were acolytes in the churches and chapels
                    where he... so we kind of grew up with that around us, but he really died before
                    I got to know him as a person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: She was a very strong person. Her name was Lauren Van Buren. Her
                    mother came from Virginia. Her father had been consul general in Nice. That was
                    before they moved consuls general around so much as they do now. He must have
                    been there for the better part of two decades. She, judging from her stories
                    about Nice was sort of queen of the roost at least when the [consul general] was
                    in town. We got to know her very well because she had a place on Cape Cod which
                    had started as an old fishing shack on the bluff, a place called Harbor's Point.
                    Then various new sections of the house had been built as the family grew, and
                    eventually houses were built on other parts of the land that she owned on that
                    bluff. We always went back for Sunday breakfast, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was your grandmother.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. She would really put on the dog with real silver and then she had
                    somebody waiting on table, that sort of thing. So she was still acting as though
                    she was the [consul general's wife], which at any rate she was.</p>
                <p>My mother was quite tall; she must have been close to 5'10‚Äù, a striking woman.
                    Her early pictures indicated she was a very beautiful woman. When my father
                    died, one thing she decided she didn't want to do was to stay in Vandalia, Ohio,
                    [near] Cincinnati, which was full of Clevelands. She didn't want to be just an
                    appendage of the Cleveland clan. She had been quite ill during the last year he
                    was alive, so her doctor was recommending that she move south and get out of the
                    bad weather, the winters and so on. Her story is, she said to him, how would the
                    south of France be. That surprised him and he answered that would be all
                    right.</p>
                <p>The first 13 years of her life she lived in Nice. She was fluent in French and
                    also spoke German and Swiss-German. Every time she went on vacation, she went to
                    Switzerland. I remember her singing lullabies in Schweitzerdeutsch. Once I
                    learned a little German and heard the Swiss-German talking, I wondered how
                    anything so guttural with so many consonants in it could be converted into a
                    lullaby that rhymes. So we moved to a very lovely little town. There was a
                    school run by a British group, but in French. So we learned French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been you started there in the
                        mid-'20s?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: This would have been 1926, or '27 probably. During the whole winter, I
                    know this sounds ridiculous; we moved to Geneva. I had an older brother and
                    sister, twins, just 18 months older, so we were all growing up together; and a
                    much younger brother five and a half years younger. My brother was a Foreign
                    Service officer as a matter of fact. Then I went to school which was about an
                    hours commute from Geneva, overlooking Lake Geneva, a place called Coupe. My
                    sister was put in a school in Lausanne. My younger brother who was very young,
                    about five or so was put into a little boarding school. I am not exactly sure
                    how all of this was managed since she was living on a minister's pension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: She didn't have a lot of resources of her own, but her grandmother had
                    some relationship with Mrs. Proctor of Proctor and Gamble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who came from the Cincinnati area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: But that wasn't the connection. I don't know what the connection was,
                    but she had inherited from her some Proctor and Gamble stock. That was split up
                    among the four of us, but that stock today, our quarter of a quarter roughly,
                    with all the splits and stock market increases, is worth something around a
                    million dollars to my astonishment. So that stock has always been in my whole
                    life kind of an anchor. We were very careful with it; we didn't sell it. We
                    borrowed against it, and that by far turned out to be the best strategy. All of
                    my siblings have all of theirs and they haven't run into trouble themselves. My
                    mother did not have much income, but she certainly had some backup from my
                    grandmother. Apparently in those days the dollar must have been relatively
                    strong even though it was depression times because it went quite a ways getting
                    us into private schools and so on.</p>
                <p>So we were two years in Switzerland. When I was 12, I was essentially completely
                    bilingual in French. I kept rusting over and reviving and then rust over some
                    more. My French has always had a little bit of an accent from the canton near
                    Geneva. They were good schools except for the fact that I got the impression
                    that the metric system was so natural that it must be universal. When she
                    decided to bring us all back home, I was 12 or 13 or so, I took an exam, a
                    series of tests for Andover. I got 98 in the [other exams, but] and flunked the
                    arithmetic. They were so astonished by this that some young instructor dug into
                    it and found out that I had done all the problems as if a ton was a thousand
                    pounds. If I had known about the non-metric system, I would have scored very
                    well on the thing, so they let me in.</p>
                <p>She moved to Andover. She had a free choice of where to move and she decided that
                    the place to move was where there was a good girls school and a good boys
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, Abbot Academy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Abbot Academy was there, so we moved to Andover. She never had worked
                    in terms of getting a job before, but after a while, she felt that she needed to
                    pick up some more income, so she went to work, first as a hostess in what we
                    called the beanery, the student dining room.</p>
                <p>Quality was kind of for the others, students who worked; it was quite a dramatic
                    thing to have a grande dame sweeping in the dining room. It sort of toned the
                    place up. I still remember the first night she turned up in that garb. Students
                    were doing the normal thing, throwing buns at each other across the table. A bun
                    came her way so she reached out and caught it. The place was dead silence.</p>
                <p>We trained her well; we practiced baseball with her and so on. Everybody wondered
                    what she was going to do with this bun, and she threw it back at the student who
                    had thrown it. That stopped the bun throwing from then on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about before while you were in Switzerland, were you
                        getting any American studies by reading? I mean were you reading Mark Twain,
                        or were you pretty well getting a continental education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was basically run by a Swiss who was our hero because he was also
                    the driver of a four-man bobsled that was the world's champion at the time. Most
                    of the faculty were European. There may have been one or two Americans and a
                    couple of British. We were forbidden to speak anything but French.</p>
                <p>Your sanctions, one of the punishments, was to page. We had to write out three
                    pages of longhand. For a while it was sort of an underground network of writing,
                    three pages in different handwritings, and selling them to different students.
                    There was always a black market. In any rating system there is always a black
                    market. The result was that we really did speak French most of the time and
                    studied in French, and then I got to know Latin very well. It was a good school,
                    it had athletic facilities and it was quite well set up. I played soccer and
                    tennis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Andover, did you find yourself
                        disadvantaged? I mean you obviously had the French and the math and all of
                        that. I was sort of wondering about baseball, American history and that sort
                        of thing that a student normally...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No. I probably didn't get much American history, but I had this
                    comparatively cosmopolitan education for a 12 year old. I had French at that
                    time and a lot of German; the result was that I actually skipped a grade. I
                    applied there as what they call a freshman first class. They put me into the
                    second year already. The result was when I graduated, I was only 16. So then I
                    went to Princeton and graduated from there at 20. So, I was kind of younger than
                    everybody else through most of my youth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at Andover, what were your major interests both
                        academically and for entertainment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, as far as academically, I was really just interested in getting
                    good marks and did. I didn't know what I wanted to do except that I wasn't
                    particularly drawn to science, partly because it was such a different
                    mathematics and partly because I was really more interested in society. I was
                    always kind of interested in politics and public affairs. Athletically, I played
                    tennis pretty well. I actually went on to be on my college tennis team later on.
                    Really most athletic enthusiasm was devoted during the summer to sailing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was up in Cape Cod?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Cape Cod. Wherever we were during the rest of the year, we were always
                    in Cape Cod for a couple of months during the summer. So I kind of began
                    thinking of that as home, and other places as outlying precincts, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading, you know, novels or history. What did
                        you like to read at Andover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I read some novels, but I was never a big voracious reader. I
                    read a lot of current stuff. I read newspapers and magazines. We had Popular
                    Mechanics for several years in the house, this kind of thing. I soaked up a good
                    deal of normal literary culture, I suppose, just because you had to read it for
                    school. So I knew who Walter Scott was. I think I probably missed a good deal of
                    the reading that Lois did. She is a voracious reader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also, it was a time when publications were very
                        important. I mean, almost everybody got Life Magazine or the Saturday
                        Evening Post and they read the various stories and other things in the Post
                        and then Time Magazine and maybe Liberty. I mean these were a major,
                        everybody was reading these then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Right. Today you have television as an alternative. I was always
                    interested in music. I never really got to play the piano very well, but I loved
                    to sing. I was in the choir and everything that was involved with singing, I was
                    into. We lived in town so we were townies. That was kind of an inferior category
                    to be in as a student, to not have one of the dormitories as a residence. But, I
                    survived that academically, and socially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Princeton always sort of a goal of yours because your
                        father had been associated with Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, not particularly. He had actually gone to Princeton for one year,
                    and didn't apply himself very well, and was failed out of Princeton. Then, he
                    went to the University of Virginia, where he did very well. As I look back on
                    it, I think that I went to Princeton as what I perceive now as a very active
                    minor revolt against the fact that most of my classmates were either going to
                    Harvard or Yale. I was going to do something different. To do something that
                    different these days, you would probably have to go to the University of
                    Djakarta. But that was a minor affair.</p>
                <p>As I say, there was no difficulty getting into Princeton. My roommate all through
                    Princeton was a guy I had known well at Andover who still lives here I think. I
                    was young and socially not very self confident yet, depending more on my brain
                    than anything, than on any other factors. At Princeton, I was lucky in one way,
                    I played football on the freshman team. I never thought I was particularly good
                    at it, and it took so much time, about six or seven hours a day during the
                    season. Anyway, I stopped playing football at the end of the Freshman year,
                    which was indeed the time to stop. Quit while you are ahead because our freshman
                    team was undefeated, untied, and unscored on in the Ivy League. In those days
                    the Princeton varsity was the best of the lot. My fellow tackle on the freshman
                    team disproved my theory because he became captain of the team and was compared
                    to a running back. He was 6'5‚Äù and over 200 pounds which was a lot in those
                    days. He was also a Phi Beta Kappa, so he disproved my theory that you couldn't
                    do both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Princeton from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: '34 '38. I came back in '31 and then for three years at Andover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a member of the Kneading club, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I got a Key and Seal which was sort of intermediate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a rather discernible class system at Princeton
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Oh yes, as far as wealth, and old Princeton ties too. I forget the
                    others, but the older the ties, the nearer the campus. Prospect Avenue was the
                    street. One thing that was very good from my point of view in a later career was
                    that I got very much involved as a freshman in the political debating societies,
                    two societies which are really one big club. the American Greek classic society.
                    A friend of mine, a tall blond named John Van Ness was following a school, a
                    missionary school in Basra, Iraq.</p>
                <p>John and I were great friends and we were both sort of active in this public
                    affairs club. We decided in our sophomore year to run for president, he
                    president, I vice president, which was a very unusual thing to do. It was
                    usually just marching orders. Our candidacy was opposed by all the upperclassmen
                    but delighted all the freshmen. We organized all the freshmen like Tammany Hall,
                    and won the offices by one vote. The head of the society was Gordon McRay, who
                    later on became a very well known historian. He also ran the Californian. One of
                    my freshmen cell leaders was Bob Goheen, who later became president of
                    Princeton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later ambassador to India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That's right he became Ambassador to India. In fact, we visited him
                    there. Also we got something around here, Herb Green for one thing; he became a
                    valuable man. He cost me a hundred dollars at the time. I kept in touch with him
                    during later years. So Princeton was kind of exciting. we would now call it an
                    education for leadership as a subject but they didn't call it that at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the studies? Did you major in or concentrate on
                        any areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I majored in what they call politics. Now it is called political
                    science but politics is a much better word for it. It is obviously not a
                    science. I majored in that and I took everything I could in the Woodrow Wilson
                    School which at that time was not a graduate program. It was sort of just
                    beginning public affairs concentration at the undergraduate level. It was
                    interesting, their way of teaching. They would have conferences. The seniors in
                    the class would be a congressional committee, and the juniors would testify
                    back. There was one issue about education in the cotton south. I testified on
                    behalf of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored
                    People). I went and visited the NAACP and found out what they were about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain for somebody who does not know what the
                        NAACP is.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which
                    still exists today as a lobby organization in Washington. So it was very
                    exciting and a very different kind of education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the NAACP, my impression is Princeton was
                        sort of the place where gentlemen from the south were sent in those days so
                        it had a rather heavy southern cast to it. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: If you are thinking of it as having a southern cast, no. It had sort
                    of an upper class cast. Most of the students were from families that were pretty
                    well off. I was comparatively less well off than most of them. I had jobs. I
                    waited on tables in the dining hall and sold sandwiches at night time. I did a
                    lot of stuff like that to make ends meet. I think it was more sort of class and
                    affluence than southernness. There weren't very many dark skinned people there,
                    though one of my friends was a Japanese who was the son of the guy who had just
                    become prime minister of Japan. He never did graduate because he didn't have his
                    senior thesis done. He went down to Washington and came back with a senior
                    thesis which had obviously been written by the embassy for him, and they never
                    let him graduate. He was captain of the golf team and an extremely good golfer.
                    I always put most of my time into studies in that area. A lot of politics,
                    political science, some economics, some sociology and anthropology. I had an
                    opportunity, they have a system there called the no course plan where if you do
                    well enough through your junior year, you don't have to take any courses in your
                    senior year; you had a thesis to do. I was in that category, so in my senior
                    year I worked harder and took more courses I wished to take but couldn't fit
                    into my program. I took a course in anthropology, for example. I also used the
                    summers very creatively. Between freshman and sophomore year, I went with my
                    brother on a thing called ‚ÄúExperiment in International Living.‚Äù This is about
                    the third or fourth year it had existed. We went to England, so we didn't get
                    very much language difference. We had a wonderful time hanging around with a
                    group of English and Scottish students. We walked all the way across Scotland
                    from Edinburgh to Glasgow and had a good experience being with the families for
                    a few weeks in London. Cemented the relationships with the Andover professor who
                    was actually the leader of our group, and his wife. They were friends for life
                    after that. At one point we thought that maybe he would marry my mother, but
                    that didn't pan out. Between my junior and senior year, I went to the far east
                    with my favorite professor, who was Bob Reischauer, the older brother of Ed
                    Reischauer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a missionary family, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They were very famous in Japan, missionary family. They spoke Japanese
                    fluently He was being an historian but he was basically a far east specialist.
                    He was my favorite professor, and it turned out I was his favorite student. When
                    he organized a study tour for faculty members from all around the country, he
                    was chairing and teaching and so on. He put up a notice looking for an
                    undergraduate who was interested in going along. Then he asked me whether I had
                    seen the notice. I said, ‚ÄúYes, but I never answer stuff like that. It was one
                    chance in a million.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhy don't you apply for that one.‚Äù The whole
                    thing was so arranged they subsidized having me for an assistant. That was a
                    fabulous experience. We went first to Japan for about a month. Down in Kyoto,
                    was the first time I met Dwight Eisenhower. He was a graduate student down there
                    at the University of Kyoto. I learned a little bit of Japanese, enough to get
                    around. We were sponsored by an organization called the Society for Culture
                    Horizons which was of course trying to cozy up to other countries because Japan
                    was getting more militaristic and having more and more difficulty
                    diplomatically, I guess. They were trying to do the cultural diplomacy bit. From
                    there we were supposed to go to Peking as it was then called. Some people were
                    already calling it Peiping. We couldn't go there because war broke out. The
                    famous incident at the Marco Polo Bridge made it impossible, so we went instead
                    to Tientsin and Manchuria.</p>
                <p>We took a train up into Manchuria, a wonderful Manchurian railroad. It was the
                    first time I had ever seen somebody hand you a washcloth wet with hot water ‚Äî
                    you know, like they do in airplanes now. Manchuria was then Manchukuo and was
                    under Japanese control.</p>
                <p>Then we went by boat to Shanghai. We were supposed to go down overland but it
                    didn't work out that way. We spent two or three weeks in the Yangtze valley
                    area, went up the river as far as Nanking and saw a lot of places en route. I
                    got to know several Chinese guys quite well. The other student who was a
                    graduate student at Stanford and I decided we wanted to go back to Tokyo to do
                    some more interviewing. I was working on a senior thesis. It was going to be on
                    Japanese militarism and I had some more interviewing to do, so he and I left
                    Shanghai, and later the day we left, the war broke out. In our little Japanese
                    liner, we went down the Yangtze River. There was a typhoon outside that was in
                    the ocean, so it turned around and anchored in the river. The Japanese navy for
                    the next two days used our boat as a marker to go around and shoot off another
                    salvo at the city. We had a ringside seat at the beginning of the war in the
                    Yangtze valley, a very important occurrence.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>When we got back to Tokyo, we learned that in the battle of Shanghai, there were
                    big headlines about Professor Reischauer being killed. I learned the whole story
                    later that he and the whole faculty group were injured in a big sweep in a
                    central hotel, the Palace Hotel. Some Japanese planes were chasing some Chinese
                    planes, and out of one of the Chinese planes, a bomb had hit in the streets, a
                    very crowded street right outside the hotel. It blew out the whole front of the
                    hotel, and Bob Reischauer was standing at the desk. His colleagues I understand,
                    liked to play cards, but none of them had any cards. He went down to the desk to
                    get some playing cards. The obvious thought when I heard that was if I had been
                    there, I was the gopher, I would have gone down to get the cards. This was a
                    searing experience for me. The Japanese had assaulted one of their great foreign
                    missionary friends, killed in the attack on Shanghai. While we were coming in on
                    the boat, the other student, Johnny Meslin, and I were approached by a courier
                    to come and meet Viscount Metillo, who was the number three man in the Japanese
                    foreign office. He took us out to lunch. We had about three or four hours. He
                    knew that we were going to go back and that we were associated with Reischauer,
                    and he wanted us to have the right view of what was going on. I wish I had a
                    tape of that because it would be a great document. He told us exactly why they
                    were defending themselves, why they were attacking China and so on. It was a
                    remarkable thing. At that point, I was still 19, I guess. It was a great
                    experience there to be in the middle of this high politics. Then the rest of the
                    group got on a larger Japanese liner that came by Yokohama, and we came down and
                    got on and went home that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working on Japanese nationalism at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: More on Japanese militarism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this, of course, was the height of this. Did you run
                        into any problems of being a non Japanese? I mean did you find military
                        people in the street, maybe others giving you a difficult time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, I never had that feeling because from our point of view, Japan was
                    not the enemy, and I guess we were not enemies either. If anything, we were
                    associated with their good friend, Reischauer, so I didn't see any constraint at
                    all. What I was writing was a senior thesis for the politics department, so my
                    concern was the politics of militarism, that is how the militarists managed to
                    get everybody on their side. I was able to analyze how the aristocrats got their
                    way and why the civil servants were all on their side, and how it happened that
                    some of the main parties which weren't very strong, all thought their bread was
                    better on the side of the militarists. It was an interesting research project,
                    but not very deep.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean it certainly was very much to the point. It was
                        something of tremendous importance really to every American, and you were
                        getting a first-line view of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: And that turned out to be very important. For example, I applied for
                    Rhodes Scholar because the guy who had been our leader for the experiment trip
                    years before had been a Rhodes scholar, and he strongly advocated that I ought
                    to apply for scholarships.</p>
                <p>I applied where Mother was then living in Cincinnati. She had a job as assistant
                    headmistress at a school there. I had a pretty competitive reason too. All those
                    scholarships were at Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. I was applying at the Ohio
                    level; they had a two step system. The day of our interview, we went and spent
                    the day there. They would interview us one by one. There was a big incident
                    about some gunboat, a U.S. gunboat, the Panay incident. For one thing I did know
                    about the surrounding politics of that incident. I spent part of the day holding
                    a seminar for all of the other candidates telling them what the background was
                    so if they were asked about it, they would know what the professors on the panel
                    were talking about. I was fluent on the subject. I got through that, and then
                    the regional besides. The other guy who got it for Ohio was also elected at the
                    regional level, so there were two of us.. He ended up as a long time friend and
                    wound up working at Swarthmore.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Rhodes Scholar process essentially a series of
                        interviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: First you had to write out a big application and get people to swear
                    by you and send in recommendations. You had to write an essay about what you
                    were trying to do and why you wanted to go off. Then there was a two stage
                    interview. A group was selected from Ohio, and a reviewing committee picked two
                    of those. Those two along with two from each of five other states in the region,
                    four were picked from that region, so it was a double jeopardy. They looked for
                    all-roundness. They liked the fact that I had been active in public affairs. I
                    got involved in the Roosevelt campaign of '36. I had done enough in athletics
                    although I wasn't a star. I was playing lacrosse for Princeton I later played
                    lacrosse for Oxford in a game against Cambridge. I had enough athletics and
                    enough public affairs ambition and good enough grades, so I guess I was a good
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving back, I would like to pick up at Princeton during
                        the 1936 campaign; Roosevelt, greatly beloved by many people, I think among
                        some of the wealthier families, the reverse was true. Did you find yourself
                        getting in sort of acrimonious debate, or confrontation over Franklin
                        Eleanor Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Oh yes. Not so much Eleanor, we got to know her later as interns. She
                    wasn't so much on the screen, but Roosevelt and the New Deal were very unpopular
                    with the students. The faculty polled about a little over half in favor of the
                    Democrats. The student body polled two thirds in favor of Landon. It must have
                    been the only constituency in the country where he got two thirds. Also the war
                    was coming over the horizon. I got very much involved in the Princeton anti-war
                    society. I was president of the society and vice president of the political and
                    debating society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reflection to the officer movement, ‚ÄúWe will
                        not fight for king and country.‚Äù Was there a caption there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: We knew about that, but it was in general a pacifist stance. But it
                    was the liberal side of the politics of the campus. We didn't have a young
                    communist league or young socialist league, so we were it. I also worked for the
                    Princetonian, the newspaper. I was basically an editorial writer for the
                    Princetonian, so I was very much on the alert for political and international
                    things. I got involved in the American Student Union, ASU, which was about maybe
                    one-third young communist league and one-third socialist, and one-third
                    miscellaneous. I was part of the miscellaneous. I went to their first national
                    convention that they had. I was very much turned-off by the communist part
                    because of their tactics which they skillfully did in those days. They would
                    stay at the meeting longer and wait out everybody else, and then get their way.
                    But I also became associated in people's minds with that whole group, and I just
                    thought of myself as a political liberal which was minority enough for Princeton
                    in those days. I was never rally attracted at all by the communists, and I was
                    studying enough international affairs so that the Soviet Union didn't seem like
                    the paradise that some of my contemporaries painted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that time, you were getting, you know, some very
                        positive reports about the Soviet Union at a certain level. How about the
                        faculty? Were there any say ardent Marxists or admirers of the Soviet Union
                        that you ran across as a sign of politics back then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I don't really recall anybody that was overtly Marxist in the politics
                    department. There were some kind of Marxian economists who regarded Marx as an
                    important intellectual patron saint. Das Kapital was one of the books you had to
                    read, and so on. I don't really recall many spectacular radicals on the campus.
                    The only radicals that appeared on the campus were deliberately brought in for
                    effect. We got into a big altercation with the university administration because
                    we invited Norman Thomas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God! No one voted for him. You might explain who
                        Norman Thomas was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He was the socialist candidate for President in 1936 and was a very
                    bright and extremely good orator. He was also a graduate of Princeton, so the
                    university couldn't possibly object to our inviting an alumnus to come and talk
                    at a public meeting on the campus. There was just no way they could say no to
                    that. So we actually put up huge signs that Norman Thomas, Ought-6. Ought-5,
                    Ought-6, whatever it is was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was '06.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: '06, to show that this was a member of the Princeton graduation class
                    ‚Äî a family member. I actually liked him very much and thought of myself as a
                    socialist, for a little while, as a result. Later at Oxford, one of my
                    professors was G.D.H. Hall, who was one of the well known guild socialists.
                    Harold Wilson was my tutor there. He was in the Labor Party and the Labor Party
                    was the Socialist Party. It did not seem off limits to me, but the Norman Thomas
                    thing was an important moment for me because it was the first big public event.
                    We had over a thousand people there. I was the chairman; I introduced him, and
                    so forth. It was one of my first experiences at a big public controversial rally
                    situation.</p>
                <p>I always had experiences like that. I was on the debating team and so on. I
                    figured the only way to learn how to be articulate in public was to be
                    articulate in public. There is no way you can study that in a book. So, in a
                    way, you could say at the time I was educating myself for leadership in some
                    field. I didn't know what, but I thought probably the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is one of the principles of Harvard, Yale,
                        Princeton; and some other schools were designed to do; a little bit like the
                        British public schools, to get you ready to be leaders in public life, not
                        just to go into business.. I mean there was a sub-set within each one of
                        these schools that was sort of designed to get you out and going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Right it was a sub-set, because the main set was to go into a law firm
                    or a Wall Street firm in New York. That was where people were heading. You
                    didn't manufacture; you manipulated money or the law, or what have you.</p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That's right. That is where the majority of our classmates headed. I
                    was always more interested in government work. Not so much in the liberal side
                    as in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you became very much one of the figures in this, in
                        1961 when Kennedy came in, there was this great feeling of government
                        service is good, and it is really good for you. What about Princeton and
                        where you were, government? I mean you had the New Deal; you had Franklin
                        Roosevelt in, but you were in a school that was basically anti-Roosevelt.
                        How was government service viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The part that I was in, the Woodrow Wilson School, the beginning of
                    the Woodrow Wilson School which is now one of the great public affairs schools
                    in the country, was really composed of people who were interested in government.
                    The general propaganda you heard about Princeton was Woodrow Wilson's phrase,
                    ‚ÄúPrinceton in the nation's service,‚Äù which was his mantra. That measure was
                    going on all the time, and maybe just slipped off of people who were heading for
                    a life in the stock market. It caught some of us very hard and we really thought
                    of that. Today, that would be called education for leadership, but nobody talked
                    about leadership. In fact the word leadership was sort of out of fashion because
                    the leader was Der Fuhrer and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about Japan. You had something going on in
                        Europe which was essentially Adolf Hitler up to '38. Jews were beginning to
                        come to the United States, including eventually Albert Einstein and all, to
                        the Princeton area. Were you beginning to pick up any anti-Nazi things
                        coming? Was there sort of a Jewish subgroup at Princeton? How did this
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There were Jews at Princeton, but there was never an organized group
                    that I saw in our political active groups. But we were very much focused on
                    Hitler and how bad this was. And I was with a European background group which
                    was especially worried about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that at Princeton what was happening to
                        the Jews, but also you raised the Hitler menace. Was this latter topic
                        recognized then or, I assume your group would stay away from this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, we were very ambivalent, because I think we were kind of
                    appalled by Hitler and Mussolini and all that. At the same time we felt very
                    strongly about being pacifists. When I got to Oxford, I put the two together and
                    became very militantly anti-Chamberlain and the British government, which was in
                    an appeasement mode at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there weren't any particular sort of anti-Hitlerian
                        anti-fascist movements going on at Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, anti-fascist yes, because the student union groups were part of
                    their mantra at the time. You talk about mantras in those days.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Spanish Civil War? It pit the Catholics in
                        the United States because of what the loyalists were doing to the church
                        which was not very nice. They ended up as being rather pro-Franco, and the
                        labor movements and the leftist movements were strong supporters of the
                        loyalists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I remember being very much in favor of the Spanish loyalists. That was
                    sort of a minority view because in a way most of the campus wasn't paying that
                    much attention. So, a lot of the people speaking up about Spain were the people
                    in favor of the loyalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps)? Were you
                        going out and stoning the ROTC cadets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, the ROTC, as such, was not the kind of issue it became later on in
                    the postwar period. There was never a controversy about having an ROTC on campus
                    or anything like that at that time. We allowed the Princeton anti-war society to
                    meet, campaigning against the local students who were wearing uniforms and like
                    that. It seemed a perfectly natural thing to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to the Rhodes scholar. You were selected to go
                        to be a Rhodes Scholar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: In '38, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your plan? You are supposed to give what you
                        planned to get out of it. Did you have anything in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think very early the principle that I formulated, and tried to sell
                    to the schools of planning and public administration, was improvisation as a
                    general sense of direction. I guess I was improvising on the general idea that I
                    wanted somehow to be in public affairs, in government, in the New Deal. That was
                    the big thing at the time. I was very excited about what the New Deal was trying
                    to do. They were trying to do something about poverty; trying to get the country
                    back in motion, very much socializing government. I didn't care about Social
                    Security or Medicare or things like that, but I was drawn to the anti-poverty
                    aspects of it. I was drawn to the sense that if something needed to be done, the
                    federal government ought to do it. This was very much the thinking at the time,
                    if you were a Democrat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in a different area when you are talking about
                        your days at Andover and Princeton. Had you very much exposure to what they
                        call African Americans, blacks, to poverty the piney woods of New Jersey or
                        anything like that, or was this more theoretical?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was more theoretical and ideological. I later got an election job
                    which was my first full-time job after that internship. The Social Security
                    Administration was the huge agency representing different parts of the country.
                    I was in the information division, so I was a propagandist. I went all over the
                    country, and I learned a lot about what were some of the poorest areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will come to this later on, but we do want to get this
                        first. Let's take the Rhodes Scholarship. You went off in '38. Things ere
                        beginning to heat up in Europe by that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They were indeed. I started off in a class they called the ‚Äúregular

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I was at University College, which is the same one Clinton went to
                    later. It was a nest of the communists, and Beveridge was the master. You know
                    Beveridge. Young Harold Wilson was sort of up and coming, an instructor I guess
                    you'd call him. He was my tutor. I participated in a thing called the master's
                    discussion group which went on for a few weeks. Somebody did a paper and we
                    would criticize it, and so on. The very good friends, we were an inseparable
                    threesome: Steve, who was a third rank and played piano very well; I heard jazz
                    piano from him. The other one was Carl Burden who was training to be an
                    economist.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Toward the end he was with the Kennedy administration. He had one of
                    the best political minds I have ever run across. Steve became very active and
                    then paused for some education at Syracuse while I was in the Maxwell School at
                    Syracuse. He wanted to prepare the way to leave there if it became possible, if
                    the Democrats got back in. He had tenure and became the obvious person to be my
                    successor. Also, he was one of my best friends for life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Oxford when you arrived in '38? What was
                        your impression of British society, that segment of what you were
                        observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, obviously, it was more stratified than anything I had been used
                    to before, even compared to Andover and Princeton. There were people who went to
                    Oxford and Cambridge and then there were other people who went to Leeds and
                    Manchester and Birmingham, and places like that. We didn't know anything about
                    those others. A good number of our professors that we listened to in lecture
                    halls were people who were in and out of London. So some of the professors I had
                    were people who were quite close to government and knew how it worked. I got a
                    vision of the British government and came to understand the differences between
                    the parliamentary and our system and the difference between their civil service
                    and our messy system. Political appointees and our assistant secretaries have
                    often been that way. I was interested in that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>A Ph.D. had a gorgeous red robe. Not like the black robes that we had. I selected
                    as my topic: compulsory military service in democratic states. My sources were
                    piling up on me pretty fast as war came. I sort of started out with the idea
                    that I do not favor military service. I concluded after studying that the
                    democratic way was to have a citizen army. That was part of my conversion anyway
                    from being greatly against war to being militantly against the Chamberlain
                    policy of appeasement. I joined the Oxford University Labor Club which was
                    probably the campus element of the party, and I became its director of
                    propaganda. I organized demonstrations. I never really liked to participate in
                    demonstrations, but I guess I was quite good at organizing them. I organized a
                    large group of students all wearing Hitler masks and coming down the high and
                    main streets. It was a wonderful opportunity. That picture got picked up all
                    over the world. Oxford students demonstrating against Hitler. That was fun; I
                    enjoyed that kind of thing.</p>

                        movement really, up until the '90s, was so ideologically tilted in England,
                        as opposed to a much more pragmatic labor movement in the United States. It
                        would have been a little bit difficult for an American...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well I was not in the labor movement. This was the Labor Party which
                    had the trade unions as their biggest asset. But there were a lot of people like
                    Harold Wilson who were not in a union of any sort, but they were kind of the
                    natural leaders of the Party. I really didn't think of it as being in a league
                    with TUC which was the liberal group out there. They weren't around Oxford.
                    People at Oxford were the Harold Wilsons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In light of your later experience with this sort of thing
                        in and out of government by people who were teaching at Oxford, did you find
                        that there was much more of a practical approach to government? My
                        experience has been that often with our academic world there is a real
                        disconnect between the people who teach and the people who don't. I mean,
                        they really don't talk the same language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well I guess I happen to mix well with people who did advisory stints
                    on very practical issues. Keynes was an actual guru for it, but the issues were
                    something they were using every day in thinking what the government ought to do.
                    So, it worked out to be very advantageous to me to have gotten a good grounding
                    on Keynesian economics. I read the general theory of the primary interest of
                    money and so on. So I knew what that situation was even though I was not an
                    economist. I had never wanted to be an economist. My brother Ben was a summa cum
                    laude at Harvard in economics. He became an economist and wound up as the vice
                    president for international monetary affairs for Citibank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1938, of course, was the big year with Munich in Europe.
                        How was that playing from your perspective, at Oxford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was very controversial because a lot of people were saying we
                    were not going to get into a war over this. Chamberlain was keeping us out of
                    it. I was on the side that turned out to be on Churchill's side; something has
                    got to be done to stop this Hitler. We weren't much moved at the time by what
                    came to be known as the Holocaust. These years leading onto the war were
                    fascinating and capturing...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it really hadn't started in full until about
                        1942.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, in full, but even during the '30s that was obviously a theme
                    there. Nobody had any idea how virulent it was or was becoming. As you know,
                    even Roosevelt denied that he knew very much about it. There was some
                    controversy about whether he did or not. That was, at least the part of the
                    controversy I was involved in, the Labour Party beating on Chamberlain for being
                    an appeaser. We all hadn't decided that we wanted to go to war, I don't think. I
                    don't recall meetings I went to where anyone was advocating that Britain should
                    start a war against Germany. They were drawn into it by Hitler, as we were drawn
                    into it by Pearl Harbor.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it goes back to the mid-'30s, the Oxford movement,
                        we will not fight for king and country. Had that pretty well run its course
                        by the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was still, the group of people who had been involved with that had
                    already graduated. I think a lot of students at that time there were probably in
                    my condition. They had pacifist feelings, but Hitler had gradually overcome
                    them. For one thing, the year I was there, I don't think the Oxford Union ever
                    had a debate on that subject, that famous theme: We won't fight for God and
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as an American, did you find yourself able, in a
                        way, to float between the various worlds of Oxford without being, sort of,
                        put in your place by the British system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Oh, yes, because all of us who were over there had already graduated
                    once. Even though half of us were taking what in their terms was an
                    undergraduate course, we were a little older than they were. The Rhodes
                    scholarships have sort of a cache also. To be a Rhodes scholar was something you
                    sort of had to be. Yes, I guess I didn't have a feeling that I couldn't float
                    where ever I wanted in that situation. I had a social problem in that I had
                    promised my grandmother that I wouldn't smoke or drink until I was 21. I wasn't
                    yet 21 when I was over there. I got all the way through Princeton without even
                    having a glass of beer which was quite an accomplishment.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: My brother got started smoking because my mother smoked like a
                    chimney. My grandmother had a martini at lunch and a couple of drinks in the
                    evening, but she thought that people shouldn't start that until it was good for
                    them as her doctor said it was good for her. But she had made a deal with each
                    of her grandchildren. We'd get $500 if he or she didn't smoke until they were
                    21, and another $500 if they didn't drink until they were 21. That was in the
                    '30s when $500 was quite a lot of money. When my twin brother and sister
                    qualified at 21, there was an ethical conference as to whether they could count
                    on me to stay with it until I was 21 too because it was important that we
                    collect that $3000 because that was what we needed to buy a racing sailboat
                    together, which we did, which was of course, immediately named the Vientiane.
                    The three of us were very successful with it for several summers thereafter. I
                    didn't drink anything until February 19 when we had a party in my room with
                    Steve and Kermit and others. The first thing I drank was some awful orange
                    liqueur. I said, ‚ÄúIs this what everybody has been telling me I have been
                    missing?‚Äù I have now gotten so I like whiskey very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any German students? I can't remember if there
                        were German Rhodes scholars. How were they fitting in? Were they a problem

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There weren't very many of them, and I didn't know any of them at all.
                    I just didn't have any contacts of that sort.</p>

                        a Labour prime minister of England.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He became a very young president of the Board of Trade and Parole
                    board and various other things. He was a very active young political
                    administrator. He was an absolutely first rate mind, wonderful use and very
                    fast. When he asked you a question you had to be sure you absolutely knew what
                    you were answering because if you didn't know what you were talking about he'd
                    find that out fast. So I enjoyed contacts with him because he was so bright. I
                    was a little surprised later on when he became a major political leader because
                    it never seemed to me that he had the kind of charisma and external ability to
                    turn people on that you would think a political leader as having to have. I was
                    impressed with the fact that he was obviously on the make as a when I was 21, he
                    was 21 at the time. When I got to be 22, he was 22, so from my point of view, he
                    was more a colleague than a tutor, but he was beginning to act like a tutor.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Two years or more, if necessary. Let me interrupt that to say there
                    was one very important thing that happened during the year that didn't have
                    anything to do with the academic work that I was doing, but was very pleasant
                    for me. We got these huge long vacations, six weeks at Christmas and six weeks
                    at Easter. John Van Ness was back in Iraq and invited me to come out to visit
                    during the Easter vacation. I couldn't get any airplanes in those days, so I
                    went across to Marseilles and then a boat to Alexandria, and then a bus across
                    the desert, and so on. I found out how to get there and back. I had something
                    over two weeks in Basra. John and I went down to Kuwait, which was a pretty
                    small place of sand, sitting on this huge lake of oil. We would wander out,
                    there would be a demonstration every two or three days on something or another.
                    There were always Iraqis in the streets. John and I would go out there without
                    any sense that we were in any danger or that anybody was going to be against us.
                    He spoke fluent Iraqi Arabic so it was quite a surprise. He was about six feet
                    six with a shock of blond hair, and I was pretty tall, so there was no doubt
                    when we were out in a crowd; we were there. Everybody could see us. They were so
                    astonished by his garrulousness in their dialect that we were partly defended by
                    that. Anyway, people weren't against Americans as such, particularly at that
                    time. I didn't feel it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no particular reason to be because there was
                        British Petroleum there, and I don't think we had much of a stake there. We
                        did in Saudi Arabia, but not in Iraq.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Later the consortium of companies that bought in to Iraq's oil with an
                    Armenian intermediary who became one of the richest people in the world,
                    Gulbenkian. My wife has done business with his foundation in Portugal because
                    one of the academy of science, the head of the European part of the academy, is
                    an officer in that foundation. Anyway, I would never go out in one of the Arab
                    countries today in the way that I did then, just turning 21. I learned a lot
                    about that part of the world, its politics and geography. Ever since then, every
                    time there is a crisis over the Persian Gulf or anything, I would feel I could
                    visualize what was going on, who was where, and so on, much better than most
                    people because of this exotic experience. In that summer, thinking back on it, I
                    made the mistake of staying in London to work on my research. I worked at the
                    London School of Economics' library which is a wonderful library, and lived in
                    an apartment in South Kensington. What I should have done was to go on a
                    wonderful cruise around the Aegean Sea, and so on. I didn't know it was all
                    about to come to an end, so I figured I better get to work.</p>
                <p>Then I was traveling in Europe on the continent at the end of the summer. I went
                    to visit Geneva. My then girlfriend had a temporary internship of some sort
                    there. She arranged for a group of us to go and tour around the old Leider
                    business building which was largely deserted by that time. A beautiful building.
                    So we toured around, and as we were coming out we came by the press room where a
                    number of reporters were sort of huddled around the radio looking very glum. We
                    poked our head in and said what is going on. They said, ‚ÄúHitler has just marched
                    into Poland.‚Äù That is how I heard about the beginning of WWII.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Then I got a message soon after that from Oxford, a circular message to all
                    Rhodes scholars that they were suspending the scholarships while the war fights
                    on, and they were particularly sensitive about any Americans because there would
                    be bombing and some might get killed, and that would be their fault for having
                    encouraged them to stay. So I was told to leave and arranged to come home. Of
                    course, all my stuff was in Oxford, so I arranged for some stuff to be sent from
                    there, and never went back there.</p>
                <p>While I was in Geneva, I decided I had better start looking for a post-Oxford
                    job, and I was interested in international affairs and international
                    organizations. John Hannah had been governor of New Hampshire, I think, and at
                    that time was the director general of the ILO (International Labor
                    Organization). I got quite far along in the process of his hiring me as an
                    assistant, but then I thought it would be best not to make any personnel
                    commitments because they were thinking about moving the headquarters somewhere.
                    And they did in fact move it to Montreal for the whole wartime period. So, I
                    arranged to come home on a boat that left from somewhere in the Bordeaux area.
                    It was a small American liner. Somehow I was coming back first class. I'm not
                    sure how that happened. I guess it was just paid for by Oxford. There was radio
                    silence, so they weren't getting very good information about the weather. It ran
                    into a hurricane and a tidal wave which practically capsized this vessel, and
                    120-some people were injured. I was actually out on the promenade deck on the
                    lee side. Fortunately they had put canvas things up between the rail and the
                    promenade deck, because when the thing almost upset, it threw us all against the
                    canvas or we would have been out in the drink somewhere. Still a lot of people
                    were in the lounge. There was an orchestra there, and so on. The wave came up
                    through the windows and washed the furniture and people and instruments and
                    everything to one side. Then when it righted itself, everything got washed to
                    the other side. It was just a terrible carnage. There were no fatalities among
                    the passengers. The big problem was the whole place was a hospital. Of course we
                    all volunteered to do whatever was useful. I spent that whole night sitting on a
                    bunk with an elderly woman and holding her neck that was broken, pushing it
                    against the chocks.</p>
                <p>The whole boat was shuddering. The doctor that was responsible for her told me
                    afterward that I had saved her life and told her, so for years we heard from
                    her. We got Christmas cards from her. I learned an interesting and important
                    lesson from all that. If people hadn't turned to or had been too scared or had
                    not cooperated very effectively...</p>
                <p>When we got to New York, we were met by a body of journalists. It was impossible
                    not to notice that the people who had not been any help on board were trotting
                    off to tell their story first. Those of us who had been helpful were sort of
                    hanging back and not knowing what we should do, and so on.</p>

                        arrived back in New York in 1939 after war has broken out in Europe, and
                        we'll pick it up at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Okay, fine.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the second of March, 1999. Well, we are picking
                        this up in 1939. You are back to New York. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: '39. That is just 60 years ago. My inclination then was to try
                    Washington. It was still kind of a new deal in Washington. The American
                    secretary of the Rhodes trust, Frank Aydelotte, was the president of Swarthmore.
                    He had made an arrangement with the National Institute of Public Affairs (NIPA)
                    which had a very successful internship program in Washington. That was before
                    the government had its own internship program, so this was kind of an innovation
                    from the outside, financed primarily by the Rockefeller Foundation. They had
                    already gone through their selection process long before, but he had made an
                    arrangement that they'd take any returning Rhodes Scholars, sight unseen, as an
                    addition to their corps. There were about 35 people, young men and women. About
                    nine or ten women and the rest men were already selected and already in
                    residence down there. I elected to do that.</p>
                <p>The deal was whatever I wanted to do for the next year Aydelotte would find me
                    the money to live on if it had any educational usefulness. This obviously did.
                    He found me a grant from the Carnegie Corporation which was not munificent but
                    turned out to be enough to live on. It was about $700 for eight months. A
                    dollar, of course was worth a lot more then. So I moved to Washington and was
                    taken in by a group of former interns, mostly from the previous year, who had
                    rented a house together on Colorado Avenue. The house had eight beds and they
                    had seven residents, so they invited me in to fill up the eighth bed and pay for
                    part of the rent. That turned out to be a very nice arrangement. They were
                    congenial folks and they had the same kind of experience that I was about to
                    have.</p>
                <p>When I was sort of figuring out what kind of internship I wanted to get into, the
                    NIPA was mostly pushing for people to go into public administration, narrowly
                    conceived that is, personnel, budget, organizational management sort of thing. I
                    was really more interested in politics and I was referred to a fellow named Bob
                    Hammond who had been an intern with young Senator Bob La Follette about two
                    years before. So Phil took me up to La Follette's office and introduced me. Then
                    I sort of produced this for the managers for the National Institute of Public
                    Affairs program as a fait accompli. They had occasional interns on the Hill, but
                    mostly in the executive branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: La Follette at that time was a senator from Wisconsin,
                        wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, this was the son and former assistant of the famous Robert La
                    Follette who ran for President and was a great progressive leader. There was
                    still a Progressive party in Wisconsin I had a sort of a vague connection
                    because I had lived for two or three years when I was a child in Madison. My
                    father was the Episcopal student chaplain at the university there. If anybody
                    had asked, I would say I came originally from Wisconsin. It really turned out to
                    be a wonderful opportunity. I arrived there in November and between November and
                    January, before Congress reconvened, in these days they didn't meet all year
                    around, I was assigned to the staff of the civil liberties committee which was
                    the great congressional investigative committee of the time chasing after the
                    rich farmer organizations and intervening on behalf of the migrant workers, and
                    generally being sort of a liberal outpost of the day. That was a lot of fun, but
                    I was only there for a couple of months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, while you were there, was the South, and
                        dealing with African Americans, sort of out of bounds for the group or the
                        committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, but the main crusade of the day was sort of intervening on behalf
                    of unions. This was in the '30s when there had been a little steel strike in
                    1937. In fact, the first job I had was to be the rewrite man, the editor of sort
                    of a huge report of the investigation of the little steel strike. They were
                    chasing after the associated farmers which was an outfit in California that was
                    being nasty to the migrant workers and that sort of thing. The North South black
                    white issues were not at that point the big issue, of course. They would be in
                    the future.</p>
                <p>When the Senator came back to town, I was brought into his office and in effect
                    became a legislative assistant, trying to become an expert on farm credit. He
                    was the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, even though he was a
                    one-person party in the Senate, the only progressive. so I got to know a lot
                    about farm credit and other issues that were important in the New Deal days,
                    which in fact, led to my first paying job.</p>
                <p>As the academic year was reaching an end in May and June, the Rhodes Scholar
                    group had circulated a list of Rhodes Scholars that would be looking for jobs. I
                    was picked off that list by a Rhodes Scholar of about 1933, or so, named Jack
                    Fisher, who was head of the information division of the Farm Security
                    Administration, a huge New Deal agency. Jack was later editor in chief of
                    Harpers Magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: You may remember him. I was the last person to join that staff. So as
                    it happened, I was given the newest task, which was to relate farm security to
                    the defense program. The defense program was coming up at that time. If you
                    couldn't prove you were part of the defense program, you had more difficulty
                    getting money out of Congress and out of the budget bureau in fact. As it
                    happened, Farm Security had fallen into a couple of very useful defense jobs.
                    Whenever the Army needed to requisition some land for an artillery range or
                    something, they'd obviously take the cheapest land they could get. That was
                    where the poor farmers were. It fell to us to relocate them, the farmers.</p>
                <p>We had all sorts of fascinating adventures. I was sent in to a place called
                    Hinesville, Georgia, where they were setting up a big artillery range. I became
                    sort of the public relations officer to the county supervisor who was the
                    officer in charge. The Farm Security Administration had a county supervisor in
                    every county in the country opposite to, but not working for, the county agent
                    which was set up by the old extension service. We were making loans to small
                    farmers, people who by definition were not good credit risks. It was always one
                    of our boasts that our rate of repayment was much better than the rate of
                    repayment of the Farm Credit Administration which was doing it for the richer
                    farmers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about acting sort of as the public
                        affairs officer and dealing with the public as you were moving these
                        military bases onto farm country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: My job was to help the Farm Security Administration county supervisor
                    cope and help the farmers who had to relocate. We got, of course, a good deal of
                    money from the Justice Department and the Army who were buying, and we had to
                    help negotiate the price of these purchases, but then I had also some other
                    problems like do we move the graves also or just the people and where do the
                    people move to. Do they move as a community or do we just let them go wherever
                    they would like to go. Most of these places were kind of closed communities, but
                    they felt they really wanted to move as a group, so we tried to make it come out
                    that way. Then because we were in the migratory labor business, and had a lot of
                    experience with emergency housing, we were thrown in to helping the military
                    when they would set up a new plant somewhere, contract with a new plant to make
                    tanks or something. There would be a plant and a need for a lot of housing for
                    the workers to live there, so we worked on some of those issues too. All
                    together, it was a very exciting time for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The part of the Department of Agriculture you were working
                        for, was that also set up by Theo Lang, and others, to take pictures, James

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They had a section euphemistically called the historical section which
                    produced photographs of drought scenes and so on, and produced several very fine
                    documentary films, very famous at the time.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: Wonderful music, beautifully presented all together. That was not part
                    of the information division, but we worked very closely with them because we
                    used their stuff a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these were farmers weren't they, subsistence
                        farmers. How did you find places to put them and a way for them to make a

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well it was a question of relocating them in a place that didn't have
                    enough farmers, enough people with their experience. That, of course, was done
                    by the agricultural experts. It was, in fact, quite successful. People did get
                    relocated. It didn't produce, as it could have, a big backlash of people rising
                    in revolt and saying that the government was discriminating against them because
                    they were poor. It happened that the New Deal already had a big machinery in
                    place directed at the poor people, who were farmers in our case.. It turned out
                    to be an important piece of the reconversion of the economy from civilian to
                    defense purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble with the military or were they pretty
                        new at this game, too? I would think it would be difficult for them to
                        adjust to what they were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, but they regarded us as the answer to a maiden's prayer. They
                    were having public relations trouble with the people they were displacing, and
                    they wanted to get on with the job which was to build an artillery range or
                    build emergency housing for a defense firm or so on like that. They didn't have
                    the capability of doing that, and they were delighted there was somebody that
                    did, and was anxious to help. So, on the whole our relations with the military
                    were very good during that period. We were not doing something that they
                    expected to do. Then we were making things legal and above board. There were no
                    corruption problems connected with this as I remember. It was pretty straight
                    forward. The good thing about it was in place both an attitude and some
                    administrative machinery for helping poor farmers who were being pushed aside by
                    the needs of the Defense Department.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: 1941, so I was there for about a year and a half. I got promoted
                    several times during that period. We were able on the basis of one of those
                    promotions to get married. I had met Lois in the internship program where she
                    was in the Department of Justice in the juvenile delinquency section, Bureau of
                    Prisons. By the end of the intern year we were engaged. Both of our families had
                    difficulty with the idea, so it took more than a year later before we were
                    finally able to bring it off. Lois' family in the end didn't come to the wedding
                    which was in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her family was from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Oregon. My boss, Jack Fisher was very sympathetic with all of this and
                    wanting to make it happen, so he arranged for me to be assigned for the summer,
                    I guess it was 1940, to the Portland, Oregon regional office of Farm Security to
                    take the place of a man there just for the summer, who was coming to Washington
                    to get some advanced training. It was in my field, it was in the public affairs
                    side of the agency. The irony was the man who came to be trained, whom I
                    replaced for that time, was a former boyfriend of Lois'. Anyway we went out
                    there for the summer.</p>
                <p>That provided not only a wonderful opportunity to get to know Lois' parents, but
                    to get that all straightened out. It turned out that they had a lot of wedding
                    presents stacked up for this very occasion. Lois was able to commute; it was
                    only 50 miles to Salem from Portland. Also on the trip out, and particularly on
                    the trip back, we saw a lot of the country. On the trip back we visited a lot of
                    migratory labor camps and things which Farm Security was doing, so it became
                    part of my education about the agency as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Then Pearl Harbor happened all of a sudden, and everything changed. They
                    established almost immediately a board of economic warfare which was really a
                    cabinet committee chaired by the vice president, Henry Wallace. He had been
                    Secretary of Agriculture for eight years just before so most of the people he
                    knew were in agriculture. He selected as the executive director of the Board of
                    Economic Warfare a man named Milo Perkins, a businessman who had been brought in
                    to run the Food Stamp plan which he had been doing very successfully. Perkins
                    became the executive director. He didn't know anybody except people in the
                    Department of Agriculture, so he just swept about a hundred of us in, and we
                    became the Board of Economic Warfare. Jack Fisher became one of the assistant
                    administrators, and I came in as his assistant. So, we were suddenly economic
                    warriors engaged in preclusive purchasing of valuable raw material, conducting
                    some strange sort of secret arrangements like bringing diamond bort, which is
                    sort of crushed up diamonds in their original state, but that could be made into
                    very good industrial diamonds. The best people for doing this were the Swiss, so
                    we brought that stuff in from Genoa on neutral ships, Swedish ships mostly. It
                    would then be taken on a train guarded by German guards into Switzerland where
                    we would manufacture it into industrial diamonds, brought out again and shipped
                    back to the United States for the war effort.</p>
                <p>The Germans and the Italians had to take Switzerland seriously when they said,
                    you know if you don't make it possible for us to do some trade, which they could
                    have cut off entirely once they invaded France. The Swiss sort of stood there
                    with their hand on the plunger saying the first false move and we blow up the
                    tunnel and you won't have any way to get back and forth between the north and
                    south of Europe to your front. So it was a strange time in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself going after strategic materials? I
                        think of wolfram in Spain, that most of us had never even heard of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes and chrome in Turkey, and the like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Belgian Congo uranium.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, although I never learned much about uranium until the atom bomb
                    surfaced. It was a lively time and I was still quite young, 23, 24, 25 during
                    that period. I was a staff assistant so whenever they had some administrative
                    emergency mess in some division, I would be sent in to be in charge of that
                    division temporarily while they would turn things around and build a new
                    directory. So, for awhile, I was in charge of economic intelligence for the
                    Board of Economic Warfare.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Eventually I was put in charge of the Italian division of the Board of Economic
                    Warfare, which became the Italian division of the Foreign Economic
                    Administration when the entire agency shifted to beginning to think about what
                    it was going to do in the post war period. The Italian division consisted mostly
                    of enemy aliens, that is Italian refugees who had come over. Italy had become a
                    co-belligerent by the time I took that over, so we were actually helping Italy,
                    but for the first few months, the Germans still had most of Italy, and we were
                    helping the air force figure out what to bomb. We felt it was part of out job to
                    tell them also what not to bomb. So we made sure they knew where the cathedrals
                    were and the like. Then we had one of the men on the staff became a very good
                    friend of ours.</p>
                <p>He had run a group of aluminum factories in Italy before, but they were Jewish.
                    Mussolini decided rather late in the game that in order to curry favor with
                    Hitler, they really had to be more anti-Semitic. So, they really started to make
                    life difficult for Jews and a lot of those people came over. One of them was a
                    first rate professor of law at the University of Rome. The other was a man whose
                    father owned a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. There was another man who
                    was already a finance expert, so we had wonderful talent. They mostly spoke
                    English quite well but with varying degrees of Italian accents. So, I was
                    younger than any of them and I was the only person who could go up to Congress
                    and testify about any of that and not sound like a foreigner.</p>
                <p>As the allies decided to invade Italy in '43, our function was switched from
                    advising about warlike things to advising about how much food people in Sicily
                    would need. As soon as we occupied it we would have to worry about that. So, we
                    developed a whole passel of post war plans for Italy. That led rather naturally
                    to my going to Italy in 1944 about three months after the fall of Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was October or November. The fall of Rome was June
                        1944.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I got there in September of '44. The background of that was I was, of
                    course, subject to being drafted all this time. I was kept out of the draft at
                    first because we had one child, a so called pre-Pearl Harbor baby, conceived
                    before and born after. Then they kept drafting me and I would go up for the
                    physical exam. The eye doctors for some reason were always last in the maze of
                    procedures I faced. They would reject me because I have one eye that doesn't
                    work, a childhood accident. It made a big scar on the retina of my right eye, so
                    I can really only see with the left eye. I have peripheral vision in that eye,
                    but no direct vision. I never realized what an advantage that would be because I
                    was one of the few young white male civilians around. So there were good
                    opportunities for being promoted in the government during that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>When the draft boards finally decided they didn't want any more 1-Bs, which were
                    the limited service people ‚Äî people who would become a soldier and sort shoes or
                    something like that because they couldn't shoot ‚Äî I was told by the draft board
                    on a Friday that my card would be the next card to come up so I had better get
                    ready. Sunday morning there was a big headline in the Washington Post that the
                    Army decided not to have any more 1-Bs. Lois came rushing in from the front
                    stoop with this headline I immediately set about trying to arrange to go
                    overseas, because I had been disappointed that I wasn't in it, you know. The
                    obvious place for me to go was Italy since I was working on it. A job was
                    arranged for me to go in as a staff assistant to the political brigadier
                    general, William O'Dwyer. He later became mayor of New York city, and that was
                    part of the story, too, because I was signed up to work for him. The day I
                    arrived happened to be the day that he announced publicly that he was going to
                    come home and run for mayor of New York which he, of course, successfully did
                    several times. So there was great confusion for several weeks. It was an
                    emergency time. About the first thing I was asked to do was develop, for
                    congressional presentation purposes, a balance of payments estimate and internal
                    accounts reconciled with the balance of payments. This was regarded as an
                    impossible assignment in Washington by the people who were supposed to be doing
                    it. Because I had just arrived they said, what are we going to do about this? I
                    thought it would be duck soup because that was just the kind of numbers we were
                    always inventing in Washington. That was a normal thing for a young bureaucrat
                    to be doing. So, I assembled a couple of even younger men, and we holed up for a
                    weekend and produced the first post war balance of payments calculations for
                    Italy. This was regarded as a major miracle. It wasn't, given the background I
                    had doing that kind of work in Washington.</p>
                <p>It brought me suddenly to the notice of everybody in the Allied Control
                    Commission. The executive director was an Italian American named Tony Antolini,
                    who was a Macy's buyer before the war and was promoted to be the vice president
                    of the Allied Control Commission in charge of the economic section. This was the
                    job O'Dwyer had. Then they kind of looked around and said who are we going to
                    put into this number two job which was called the executive director. Everybody
                    were specialists. There were port experts and experts on everything, but there
                    weren't any generalists. I was enough of a generalist and I had just done this
                    apparently miraculous piece of staff work, so to my surprise and to the great
                    surprise of most of the staff, I was catapulted into this job, 1400 people
                    supposedly working for me. The next echelon below me were American full colonels
                    and British brigadiers. I had a uniform. Of course, I didn't have anything on my
                    shoulder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was handy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Indeed. It was very good to not have anything on my shoulder. I guess
                    I was self confident enough about the substance of what I was doing. I was
                    assigned an assistant, an American army regular full colonel who was an absolute
                    godsend because he was the kind of a person who knew where all the bodies were
                    buried and what would motivate all the senior people. He knew how to get medals
                    for the senior officers and do all the things that lubricated the bureaucratic
                    machinery. So Colonel Dinsmore and I succeeded because of his skill and working
                    about 16 hours a day on my part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Italians you were dealing with? I
                        assume that they knew they were co belligerents at this time, but you were
                        dealing with members of what passed for the Italian government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well the Italian government was just sort of starting up. In fact, we
                    were in a way bringing it into being. It consisted of a coalition of the six
                    Partisani parties, the partisan parties who had mostly been up conducting
                    guerrilla warfare in the mountains in the north, but also in the area around
                    Rome. They came together eventually under the leadership of De Gasperi, who was
                    a great leader I think, in a coalition government. When they first made the deal
                    to work together, we were encouraging them and feeding them information about
                    what the allies wanted, and so on. They were having difficulty deciding where
                    the first meeting of the new government would be held.</p>
                <p>Tony Antolini and I shared a huge suite with an enormous sitting room in the
                    Grand Hotel, right in the middle of town. So we said why don't you come and meet
                    in our living room. It's a neutral zone. So the first meeting of the first
                    cabinet in the new Italian government was held in our living room. I was a fly
                    on the wall. I had not known Italian before I had moved there, but I spent so
                    much time in meetings with Italians, many of whom didn't speak English, that I
                    rapidly picked it up. I never had any lessons, but by the end of the two and a
                    half years I spent in Italy, I could make an extemporaneous speech in Italian.
                    It was a very tough, demanding but very exciting job. I was in effect
                    responsible for the Italian economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how were things working? My last job overseas was as
                        consul general in Naples. Naples was the center, it had the largest number
                        of glove factories in the world, yet didn't have a single registered glove
                        factory. The Italians by that time, were very good at working in the grey
                        market, you might say, to arrange things as the Italians say. Did you find
                        this ability was in full flower while you were doing your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, and of course, the Mafia was in full flower too. Sicily had been
                    reoccupied first. We would lose whole trucks of supplies. They would just
                    disappear on their way from Naples to Rome. But we also had a lot of contacts
                    with people. For example, Naples was a major port with major damage. One of the
                    Allied Control commission's activities was to fix up the port of Naples and we
                    put a lot of investment in there. We had a number of people who worked at the
                    port and were well known to all of the Italians. So, for example, when I went
                    down to Naples to meet Lois and our very young children when they came over, I
                    had no difficulty negotiating myself a spot on the pilot boat going out. Most of
                    the people waiting for their families didn't have that opportunity.</p>
                <p>It is hard to imagine a situation where you are importing rather more than a
                    third of a big country's GNP. Everything was imported. We were importing from
                    the United States, wheat and coal. The idea of importing coal all the way across
                    the Atlantic to a European country seems ridiculous, but that is what we were
                    doing. The Ruhr wasn't yet available. The Italian farming areas were still
                    recovering from being battlefields. We had responsibility for this huge
                    importation of food. We therefore had got all involved in issues of what the
                    ration would be. For a time once the Germans were chased out of northern Italy
                    in early 1945, some of our people had to get into the reoccupied areas before
                    our troops got there in order to paste up signs saying don't tear down the
                    frescoes and so on, all the monuments.</p>
                <p>I visited Florence just a few weeks after the Germans were chased out of there.
                    The Germans were out of the Po valley but the Italian government didn't yet have
                    a government up there, so it was still military government area. So for about
                    four months I had the absolutely ridiculous job, a because I was nearly 28 by
                    then, of being named the economic commissioner for northern Italy, which meant
                    that every week I decided what the ration was going to be, how many grams of
                    pasta a day and that sort of thing. Which industries would get how much power.
                    Anywhere there was a shortage, we had to make rationing decisions. I have
                    thought since that if I had that same job today, I would probably surround
                    myself with consultants and be immobilized, but I was young and the situation
                    was so emergency that you had to make decisions, so you just made them.</p>

                        Italy, where were our priorities? I mean outside of obviously getting the
                        people fed, were we looking at any particular industry or economic sectors
                        that had to be done to get things going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well essentially, of course, southern Italy was sort of an
                    underdeveloped area, but Italy as a whole was a major industrial country. The
                    task from an economic point of view was to get it working again pretty much on
                    the pattern that had been working before, with a different style of government
                    obviously. It wasn't as difficult a thing, it didn't raise the kind of policy
                    issues that the occupation of Germany raised where you had the Soviets coming in
                    on the other side, and you had chunks of Germany allocated to the British and
                    the French and the Americans. It didn't have the same uncertainty as the
                    occupation of Japan later had, where the place was really being run by the
                    Americans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MacArthur was El Supremo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. As to Italy, Churchill and Roosevelt had gotten together in one
                    of their frequent consultations at Hyde Park. Over a meal of barbecued hot dogs
                    apparently in some outdoor setting there, they had decided what the occupation
                    policy was going to be for Italy. That policy was very simple: get Italy back in
                    the hands of the Italians. It had already been a co belligerent for quite awhile
                    so that wasn't as shocking as it would have been in Germany or Japan. So we had
                    a clear mandate to build the Italian government, get it competent enough to take
                    over the functions that we were performing, and then we could get out of there.
                    That was the policy, and that was essentially what we did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Alcide De Gasperi? What was your impression of
                        how he responded to the economic challenge, or was he pretty much on the
                        political side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, he had to handle everything during the frequent times that he
                    was prime minister, but he was basically an active and skillful coalition
                    builder. Although he was a Christian Democrat, they never had a clear majority
                    in anything. There were all these other parties, so he had to keep moving people
                    around and trying to inspire the general population with the good future for
                    Italy. I think what we did on the economy was to provide an enormous blood
                    transfusion and to build the industrial and economic and to some extent the
                    currency stabilization environment for what came to be called after the war, the
                    ‚ÄúMiracolo economico Italiano.‚Äù Italy took off much faster than Germany or Japan,
                    and a lot of that really was the result of a lot of little wise decisions made
                    by the occupiers and the industrialists and the local political leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever called upon by the Italian government to say
                        we have got, for political reasons, to make sure this coalition hangs
                        together? We have to support the sewing machine industry as opposed to
                        something else. In other words, some adjustments were for political reasons
                        to keep things together.</hi>

                <p>CLEVELAND: There was some of that, but the industrialists were not closely linked
                    to the party. Their general idea was just keep the government out of our hair,
                    and we'll make it happen. People like the Agnelli family that was running
                    Fiat...</p>

                    leaders. They didn't want to be in politics because politics was too
                    complicated. There were too many parties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, there was never a thing of that kind. Maybe it was because the
                    Italians were never willing to take that seriously, the sort of ideological
                    fascism of Mussolini. I think that a lot of the corporative life of the country
                    was theoretically run by the government. My office was actually an enormous
                    office as executive director.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: Very heavy architecture. I think the top business people that I came
                    to know had a general orientation like the top business people in this country.
                    That is, they regarded the government as an inconvenient necessity. They had
                    their own strategies and mostly their own links with America and other European
                    countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The British, yes. The French were not. The Allied Control Commission
                    was a U.S. U.K. thing completely. The British Eighth Army kind of came up the
                    west coast, and the American forces, Fifth Army mostly, took care of the east
                    coast and through Cassino, the Anzio landings, and that whole history. The
                    American air force which was still an army thing at that time, and the Royal Air
                    Force were working very closely together. There was a joint headquarters down at
                    Caserta not far from Naples.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was a huge place. We were of course G-5. We were the civil affairs
                    part of the thing, but we were quite different and separate. We were set up
                    right in the middle of Rome, in requisitioned government buildings and living in
                    requisitioned houses. While Caserta was kind of our regional headquarters, most
                    of our real dealings were with Washington and London directly by cable. People
                    in Caserta didn't know very much about the Italian economy and didn't try to
                    second guess us on that. Our second guessing was done in Washington, not in
                    Caserta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the communists? I mean they were a major
                        partisan movement, and when they came in during this early period, how did
                        you work with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They were one of the six parties that formed the original government
                    under a fellow named Buonomi. In fact, in that first cabinet meeting held in our
                    living room, the minister of finance in the first Italian government was a
                    communist. So they were not beyond the pale at all. In a way, it was a huge
                    party. I mean they probably had more members than any party except maybe the
                    Christian Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They always had a disciplined party as opposed to some of

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They were more disciplined than the Italian parties, but they weren't
                    nearly as disciplined as the French or some of the other European communist
                    parties. They were more of a membership organization than political parties
                    often are. There was a time there in the early days when they were pulling down
                    something like a third of the vote in Italy. In the 1948 elections which was
                    sort of a crucial moment, they were only narrowly defeated.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I think, I didn't leave there until the spring of 1947, as the
                    war was winding down. We were looking forward to what came to be called VE day
                    and then VJ day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: VE day was April, '45 and VJ day was August, '45.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, and by that time, the U.S. and British governments had decided
                    that the function we were performing, particularly in the economic side, should
                    be taken over by UNRRA, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
                    Administration, which was already operating a small welfare-oriented relief
                    program, and which also had sizable operations starting in Greece and
                    Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine, China and elsewhere. So, I was appointed a member
                    of the U.S. delegation to the meeting of the UNRRA council, which was the
                    governing body of all the governments which met in London in August of 1945. I
                    was the first to sort of write and politic about the resolution we needed from
                    that governing body, saying that UNRRA would take over what we now call the AID
                    program from the Allied Control Commission.</p>
                <p>So we put through a U.S.-U.K. initiative. The U.S. had most of the clout in
                    UNRRA, but the resolution said that the burden would be shared by the other
                    countries too. That meant that there would be a large UNRRA mission, and the
                    people who were running the UNRRA organization as a whole. Former governor
                    Herbert Lehman of New York was the director general. The number two was a
                    wonderful guy named Commander R.G.A. Jackson, Robert Jackson, known to all of
                    his friends as Jacko, whose wife was Barbara Ward.</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He didn't appreciate being known as Mr. Barbara Ward. People sometimes
                    called him that behind his back. They propositioned me in London. In one
                    dramatic moment VJ day happened, so there were huge celebrations in Piccadilly
                    Circus and Trafalgar Square and so on. We went down and it was just mobs of
                    people. So it was just at that point in world history that this decision was
                    being made. They asked me if I would stay in Italy and essentially do what I was
                    doing, run the AID program, run the importation of assistance and all the
                    complications that required in the way of arrangements for the Italians. I made
                    two conditions which I didn't think they would accept. One that I felt they
                    probably would accept was that I would be able to bring Lois and the children
                    over. That turned out to be feasible. The second was I said the best way to
                    build a new mission would be for me to just take the hundred best people out of
                    my 1400 and give them all their first post war job. Every one of them is going
                    to need a new job. Many of them were military; some were not. So I was able to
                    pull together an absolutely first rate staff, much smaller but on the average
                    more competent than we had in the Allied Control Commission even. I accepted
                    then when they agreed it would be done this way. For a period of two or three
                    months I actually had both jobs. I was both deputy chief of mission for UNRRA,
                    because there already was a chief of mission there, a man named Sam Keeny. Tony
                    Antolini had gone home, so I was made acting vice president, a job O'Dwyer had
                    before, of the Allied Control Commission for it may have been as much as three
                    or four months. Concurrently I was also deputy chief of the UNRRA mission making
                    all these arrangements about people transferring, and also complicated
                    arrangements about where the supplies were going to come from and who was going
                    to pay for them and all that. It was very demanding and professionally a lot of
                    fun. It was just an extraordinarily interesting job. I stayed there for a year
                    conducting the AID program for UNRRA.</p>

                    very carefully. He was said to be unpredictable, and he turned out to be
                    extremely unpredictable. There were some wild stories of that period.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, one day, which was fortunately not my day for organizing, my
                    colleague handled all the welfare and social programs, They took him out to,
                    where was it? I can't remember, but outside of Rome. A sizable town outside.
                    Everybody was mobilized. The Archbishop was there; schoolchildren were there;
                    everybody was there to greet the great man. He was already very well known
                    because he had this radio program during the war. As they get to the edge of
                    this huge crowd, Fiorello LaGuardia says to the driver, ‚ÄúDrive on.‚Äù Well what
                    could he do. You were a driver and the great man says drive on, you drive on. He
                    drove all the way through this crowd and out the other side. There was this long
                    line of cars all of them marked ‚ÄúUNRRA Frascati.‚Äù So they went through Frascati
                    and into the next little town, which I think was Grottaferrata, I'm not sure.
                    So, he tells the driver to stop. The driver stops and all the other cars stop.
                    He gets out and sort of turns to the public affairs officer of UNRRA, who was
                    traveling with him and says, ‚ÄúWhy isn't there anybody here to meet me?‚Äù</p>
                <p>The next day we all had to troop out to Frascati and apologize to the Archbishop
                    and mayor and everybody for this behavior. Also on my day, he was very busy. We
                    took him up to Bologna and Milan by charter plane, military plane. We visited a
                    great steel mill. I can't remember the name, but it was a major industry. As we
                    were touring the place, he noticed there was a big gathering of people in the
                    cafeteria. So he goes into the cafeteria, and everybody greets him. I'm standing
                    next to Mr. Falk, I think his name was, owner of this great establishment. He
                    starts haranguing the workers saying they shouldn't take any nonsense from
                    management. They should be sure and stand up for their rights. That is what he
                    was there to tell them and so forth. With an industrialist standing next to me
                    sort of not knowing what to do, obviously disagreeing very much but not wanting
                    to say so and so on. It was just very embarrassing.</p>
                <p>Then there was another incident in Rome toward the end of his visit. His Italian
                    was reasonably fluent but with a very poor accent and a lot of sort of foul ups
                    on vocabulary. He is visiting Capitoline Hill, where there is a statue of
                    Romulus and Remus and the wolf. He places his hand on the wolf and he is talking
                    Italian to the crowd and he says, ‚ÄúMister Volpe.‚Äù Of course, people don't want
                    to laugh at the great man but he had said ‚Äúthis fox‚Äù and not ‚Äúthis wolf.‚Äù It was
                    just sort of one thing after another like that. We'd breathe a sigh of relief
                    after he left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like he was playing more of the American
                        politician than your UNRRA administrator.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Very much. He made several speeches to the general effect that you
                    have got to understand where all this aid is coming from. It is coming from the
                    American people. He forgot about the British and other allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Irrespective of a certain New York politician, how did you
                        find the UNRRA operation worked in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It worked very well, actually. It was in fact an enormous success. It
                    was part of the post war economic miracle. We focused not just on the relief,
                    but we focused on building industries, transportation, ports, airports and so
                    on. We were really laying down the infrastructure for their post war recovery in
                    a quite systematic way. We had very good support from our bosses in Washington,
                    particularly this fellow Commander Jackson who became a very good friend. We
                    were on the telephone with him all the time. We had very competent people
                    because we had brought in this wonderful corps of people at the beginning. The
                    chief of the mission, who was primarily interested in the social side of the
                    mission, gave me a very free hand to work on the economic stuff, which of
                    course, was the biggest part of it. with the biggest amount of money involved.
                    There was a very generous ration of funds we were being given by the
                    organization, so I think that it was rally an outstanding success. It was by far
                    the largest. I mean you can take UNRRA as a whole, including China. It was by
                    far the largest operational thing the UN has ever done.</p>
                <p>People talk now about how the UN couldn't fight its way out of a paper bag, and
                    so on. But the fact is, there were many advantages in being able to operate as
                    an international organization in such a situation. We didn't have to explain
                    away what our government was doing about nuclear weapons or anything like that.
                    We could act more professionally that it was possible for an AID mission to
                    act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Catholic Church? What was your relation with
                        the church during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, we didn't have a lot of relationship with it. At one point, a
                    meeting of all the UNRRA missions was held in Rome. We arranged an audience with
                    the Pope which is one of the first things he did, one of the first general
                    audiences he held after the war.</p>
                <p>Some of the group had a very late party the night before, Saturday night, so on a
                    Sunday we came in and went to the Vatican. The man who was sort of our spokesman
                    on behalf of all the UNRRA people who were there started off somewhat in a fog.
                    He said, ‚ÄúWe want to thank your Holiness for this audition.‚Äù</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>But apart from formal occasions like that, we didn't have very much to do with
                    the church as such. We dealt a lot, of course, with the Christian Democratic
                    Party. They had a lot of interaction with the hierarchy, but we really didn't
                    get to know them during the UNRRA period. I went to the first big public
                    ceremony, laying on of hands of a lot of new cardinals. The most vivid comment I
                    remember about it was my chauffeur who was a semi communist from Yugoslavia,
                    married to an Italian. I said to him something like you know there are 40 new
                    cardinals . He shook his head sadly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in 1947?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: In the spring, in late April or early May.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the crucial time as you mentioned before was the
                        election of 1948. We went all out and the Soviets went all out to see if the
                        communists could take over the government. Was the cold war apparent by the
                        time you had left, and were we sort of seeing that this was going to be as
                        critical as it was, or was it still the honeymoon post war period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The honeymoon didn't last very long. Of course, Stalin's actions were
                    clear early on. They were obviously trying to use the western European communist
                    parties as agents. That was I think more difficult in Italy than it was in
                    France. The Italians were somewhat less disciplined and they had this big party
                    which appealed to large numbers of people. They were hard to bring into a
                    disciplined cadre. But that was obviously going on and they kept trying. The '48
                    thing was kind of the watershed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and others doing everything we can to support the
                        Christian Democrats? This is going to be critical. Was that apparent at the
                        time? Were we doing anything within your competence to bolster one side or
                        the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There were several sides. We were trying to get a sort of center
                    government. It obviously had to be built around De Gasperi and the Christian
                    Democrats. We saw a lot of young politicians just a little older than I. One was
                    named La Malfa. Ugo La Malfa, who later became a minister in various
                    governments. That was the action party, and they were mostly in every
                    government. The socialists were split. Nenni was the head of the socialists, but
                    there was sort of a split off right wing of the socialist party that often
                    participated in governments. Nenni could never quite decide whether he was going
                    to be part of the left with the communists or if he wasn't. As a result, he
                    never really played the role in post war Italian politics that he might
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting that Italian socialists never became the
                        party that the German socialists or the labor party in France. These were
                        major parties. The socialists in Italy were sort of undercut by the
                        communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: And it was undercut by their own unwillingness to divorce themselves
                    from the communists. If they had planted their flag as the non-communists of the
                    left, I think they would have become the kind of socialist party that France and
                    Germany had. It didn't work out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were with the UN, was there any feeling as
                        things were moving on of throwing support in one way or another to the
                        non-communist side? I mean were we getting kind of interested in making sure
                        that se sere supporting the non-communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, in effect. That was true all through the UNRRA thing. It was
                    mostly run by the western countries; most of the money was coming from the
                    western countries. We had a program of relief and rehabilitation in the Ukraine,
                    part of the Soviet Union. But the Soviets were not a very important part of the
                    governments because they weren't making much of a contribution. On the other
                    hand, on some issues they made a big noise. For example, at one of the UNRRA
                    council meetings, there was a big issue about refugees and whether they would be
                    pushed to go home, home meaning the Soviet Union. There was a deep split,
                    basically a cold war split among the countries, and it came out right that the
                    refugee that was seeking freedom shouldn't be prevented from getting
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it apparent that the Soviets were exerting control and
                        calling some of the shots among the Italian communists while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was clear that they were trying, but it was also clear that the
                    communist leadership, Togliatti, was wise enough to fend off the Soviets a good
                    deal, and to keep sort of at arms length. Increasingly as they saw the cold war
                    developing and saw that Italy was clearly going to be on the western side of
                    that line, there was no future in their being the agents of the Soviet Union, so
                    they had to be Italian nationalist communists, sort of. They still took in a big
                    vote, like a quarter of the vote for quite awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, even in my time, which was '79 '81, they were still
                        picking up 23 24 % of the vote. This is a family matter, almost. Were events
                        in Yugoslavia with Trieste and all that, was that a complication or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Not really. We sort of watched the politics of that. I went up to
                    Trieste once. My concern was which part of the territory we were going to be
                    responsible for providing...</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zone A, Zone B and all that sort of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: And there were negotiations about the future of Trieste going on
                    during some of that period early, which went on for years and years afterward.
                    But I was never very much involved in all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left in 1947, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I went to China and became the head of the UNRRA mission in China,
                    which was by far the biggest UNRRA mission, spending about 2/3 of a billion 1947
                    dollars in 2 ÔøΩ years. The decision had been made in the UNRRA headquarters that
                    they would wind down the European programs in 1947, but that the China program
                    would be run for one more year. The head of that mission was an American major
                    general of engineers who at one time had been the governor of the Panama Canal.
                    That was partly because one of the biggest single projects there was rebuilding
                    the dikes in the Yellow River Valley, which was an enormous earth moving job.
                    The engineer in charge told me it was the earth moving equivalent of building
                    the Panama Canal, and therefore, he said tied for second in history behind the
                    Great Wall. It was a huge endeavor. This fellow, General Edgerton, became ill
                    and wasn't able to stay, and they had another year to run.</p>
                <p>The thing at UNRRA was that an appointment to UNRRA was no longer a prestige
                    thing; you just had to find somebody that could do the job. So I get a call one
                    day from Jacko, Commander Jackson, out of the blue asking would I be willing to
                    go to China for a year. Well, I obviously would need a job if they were going to
                    wind down. On the other hand, Lois and the kids were with me, and it made for
                    family complications. I didn't think I should take them to where there was a
                    civil war going on. But it was a huge job. It was a much bigger job than I had;
                    more responsibility and a much bigger staff. There were 3000 people scattered
                    all over China in the middle of a civil war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking we might stop at this point because, I'd
                        rather start; I'll just put it on the tape here that we are going to pick
                        up, you had been offered this job in China in 1947. It was a very big job,
                        and you have given a little background about why you were offered the job,
                        and we'll pick it up at that point with what you agreed to do and why you
                        went there and what it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Right. We hadn't gotten very far along in my life. At this point I was
                    still only 29.</p>
                <p>***Q: This is the first of April, 1999. Well, you are 29 years old and you are
                    off to China. What did the job consist of as you saw it then and when was
                    this?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: This was May of 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the job as you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was obviously a very big job especially for me at that age.
                    It was the largest country program in the UNRRA setup. In the course of a little
                    bit more than two years, that program put something over 2/3 of a billion 1947
                    dollars into China. I once wrote a long paper called ‚ÄúChina is Hard to Help,‚Äù
                    discussing the difficulty of solving problems by throwing money at them. The war
                    was over, but the civil war was going from bad to worse from the point of view
                    of the nationalists.</p>
                <p>I didn't bring Lois and the children over because I didn't want to have them
                    there in the middle of a civil war. I had to go rather suddenly. When I came
                    back from Europe, I had not more than a couple of weeks to get things set with
                    Lois and then to do some consultation in Washington. I was able to make an
                    arrangement in Washington that I would have the same authority that the heads of
                    the European missions of UNRRA had. They were, of course, going through
                    reduction in force procedures. I, fortunately, got the same authority so that I
                    was able to release people if I didn't think they were contributing or if there
                    was some cloud of corruption over them, as there was with some. I was able to
                    get rid of people fast without proving anything against them. So I got that
                    authority and I was still working closely with the deputy director general of
                    UNRRA, Commander Robert Jackson, a really delightfully bright and vibrant
                    person.</p>

                <p>I got there and found there were theoretically over 4,000 people working for me,
                    1,000 expatriates, non-Chinese, and 3,000 Chinese. They were scattered all over
                    China in the middle of this civil war 15 regional offices dealing with both the
                    communists and the nationalists. We were the UN; we were supposed to be neutral.
                    Many of our employees were actually working inside the Chinese government to
                    sort of help them do their jobs. I brought just two people with me, an economist
                    and a minister of assistance that I had worked with in Italy. Otherwise it was
                    all new people as far as I was concerned. It was a little like my taking over
                    the job in Italy during the war where I was young and didn't have a military
                    ranking which was just as well because it would have been a low one. Just as the
                    military, they were inclined to take me seriously because I was in the job; the
                    same thing sort of happened in China. There had been quite a long hiatus where
                    the chief of mission had been sick. He had been brought home, actually. So
                    anybody who looked as he was in charge was sort of automatically popular, at
                    least for a honeymoon period. We were operating all over China. The only way to
                    find out anything ‚Äî for example, if there was a flood in southern China ‚Äî was to
                    hop in an airplane and go and look. So we did a good deal of that, getting
                    around in China on unscheduled airplanes, mostly former Flying Tiger planes and
                    pilots. General Chennault had set himself up as a civil air transport company.
                    Many of the Flying Tigers found their first post war jobs that way. So, I had
                    the experience of sitting next to a pilot, who says, ‚ÄúI think I'll have a nap.
                    Why don't you take over for awhile.‚Äù He showed me how I should do it. Of course,
                    I had neither the authority nor the credentials to do that sort of thing, and he
                    didn't have the authority to turn it over to anybody either. But it was an
                    informal time. I got around China a lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was UNRRA trying to do? How do you try to do
                        something for China at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Relief and rehabilitation. Trying to recover from the war. The biggest
                    single project was a huge dike-building project in the Yellow River, where the
                    Yellow River had been diverted from its old bed, its long historic bed, had been
                    diverted by the Chinese as a defense mechanism against the Japanese. It wandered
                    all over the country, destroying villages, and it seemed very important to get
                    it back into its old bed so the power arrangements could be reconstructed and
                    the country saved from this really huge river with its enormous silt content of
                    the water. I was in one village where the only thing you could see of the
                    village that had been there was the roof of the only two story building that had
                    been there. Everything else was just sand like a desert. I went up and visited
                    the Yellow River project several times. I said it was our star
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>On one visit I walked past a whole series of rusting bulldozers. I asked the
                    young engineer in charge why they had all these Chinese going up and down this
                    dike they were building with two baskets of dirt instead of using the
                    bulldozers. He said, ‚ÄúWell come to my shack here and I'll show you.‚Äù He did the
                    calculations that demonstrated that it really didn't make sense to send heavy
                    intricate machinery to an area like that if there were no machine shops within
                    1000 miles that could ever make a new part for them. Apparently one of the
                    things that went out first was the clutch assemblies. He said Chinese drivers
                    tend to ride the clutch. You remember what that meant in the old days when we
                    had clutches on cars. So I watched 1,000 people going up and down with dirt, and
                    laying the dirt on top of the dike and coming down and getting some more dirt,
                    an extraordinary operation which in the end did divert the Yellow River back
                    into its old bed. The engineer in charge of that operation, a wonderful older
                    man named O.J. Todd, said it was about the earth moving equivalent of building
                    the Panama Canal. Therefore, he said, it tied for second in world history behind
                    the Great Wall of China which is apparently recognized to be the greatest earth
                    moving job ever.</p>
                <p>Another big crisis came over some very modern fishing boats that had been
                    programmed and sent before I got there. They were the kind of boats they fish
                    with off Seattle and Vancouver: two-way radios, power driven trolling nets, that
                    sort of thing. They were enormously successful in bringing in a huge catch. They
                    were so successful that they bothered the people who ran the fish market in
                    Shanghai, the local Al Capone character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mob.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The mob of that time and place. They declared a boycott on the catch
                    of these beautiful boats. We had some problem getting the boats working. I found
                    that these imported engineers mostly got seasick and really didn't want to go
                    fishing, so we finally developed the idea of getting some Australian fishing
                    captains to come in and be the expatriate bosses and got some real Chinese
                    fishermen as their crew. These new skippers were very good at teaching the
                    fishermen what they needed to know about the machinery. So, the problem was more
                    human than machinery, though it was diagnosed first as a machinery problem. That
                    was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were looking at plans, were you able to, bring
                        bulldozers to a place where they can't repair them? We tried to think in
                        sort of western terms. Were you able to sort of modify what you were trying
                        to do because of the Chinese situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, most of the heavy and complicated equipment had already been
                    brought in before I got there. My problem was to adapt the situation to what we
                    had. In this case, for example, of the fishing boats, we had to have a big
                    negotiation with the fish market people and with the ministry of food of the
                    nationalist government in Nanking.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>We had a meeting in my office, I remember, at which, of course we didn't have air
                    conditioning in those days, and we weren't very far from the market, so all the
                    stench from the fish piling up that they weren't willing to sell was readily
                    received by our noses. The minister of food asked one of his assistants to go
                    and shut the window. I said, ‚ÄúNo, I'd rather keep it open please,‚Äù thinking that
                    would help speed up the negotiations. Anyway, what we finally did was a typical
                    Chinese compromise. Half the boats would be used for fishing, and the other
                    half, I don't remember how many there were exactly, were being diverted to river
                    transport because they were well equipped for it. They had too much equipment
                    for that. They didn't need the trolling equipment, but the two way radios were
                    useful. That reduced the amount of the catch sufficiently so that the market was
                    prepared to absorb it.</p>
                <p>We had a major agricultural industries service, so called, which was developing
                    small industry in the rural areas. This was to prevent a situation where farmers
                    would go broke and come into the city, and the cities would be overwhelmed with
                    unemployed peasants. The sort of thing that happened in American history and the
                    history of other countries, but in China it was really threatening the cities.
                    So we had a group of very bright young engineers who invented all sorts of ways
                    of doing processing locally instead of bringing it to big centers. That was one
                    of the most durable kinds of relief and rehabilitation projects I thought we
                    did, that, and the bank building. We had people helping with the water and power
                    systems of the country getting them back into shape. We had a big import of food
                    which we used for wages. All the people on the dikes, they didn't want the
                    money, because the money by that time was almost worthless. The interest rate
                    from Shanghai I remember was about 30% per month. They didn't want the money, so
                    we would import this wheat flour, and stuff like that, and deliver it to people
                    as wages. We'd bring flour all the way across the Pacific, and from Shanghai to
                    the Yellow River Valley, to the port of Tientsin. Another big distance. I mean
                    like putting in at Cherbourg and taking it to Warsaw, something like that. It
                    was an expensive operation in modern cost-effective terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you deal, I mean you were there from 1947 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Until early '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the civil war that was going
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, we had several people who went back and forth to negotiate with
                    the communists, and we did import some stuff that they needed and wanted. We had
                    great difficulty getting them to agree that none of it would be diverted to
                    their military. They regarded their military as just other citizens, you know.
                    So in practice the lion's share of what we brought in went into the nationalist
                    areas, and of course, the lion's share of the country was still under at least
                    nominal nationalist control. There was a big problem just keeping the Yellow
                    River project going because it was just in that area that the civil war was
                    heating up the most when I first got there in the spring of '47. We got so
                    frustrated by the fact that the workers would just disappear into the
                    countryside every few days because they didn't want to be shot at. A quite
                    normal motivation I thought. So we talked about it in our mission, and we
                    decided to do something that I am really surprised looking back on it any of us
                    had the guts to do. Without notice to either side and without notice to our
                    headquarters, I declared a ‚Äúcease fire‚Äù in the Yellow River Valley, with a sort
                    of eloquent statement saying that we were trying to rebuild China for whomever
                    governed it. That wasn't our problem. We wanted to rebuild it, and one of the
                    things was this huge Yellow River thing, and we couldn't do it if they got shot
                    at, so there had to be a cease fire.</p>
                <p>This was such a surprise that both the nationalists and the communists took it
                    seriously. I got very strong confidential support from my boss, Commander
                    Jackson, in Washington. Some of the foreign office people who were
                    representatives to UNRRA and the UNRRA council were grumbling about it. It was
                    precisely for that reason that had I tried to clear it; it never would have
                    happened. So it held for several weeks, and people got back on the job.</p>
                <p>Then one night a communist raiding party knocked over a local nationalist unit,
                    and the civil war was back on. But the interesting thing was they had gotten the
                    idea, and thereafter they tended to lay off the areas where the dike-building
                    was actually going on, so the drama of this cease fire initiative actually got
                    through and became sort of a public fact, even though the cease fire itself went
                    into history rather rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the problem of the nationalist government
                        particularly in that period, that was extremely corrupt. Was this a problem
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The problem wasn't much of a problem in dealing with the government
                    people we dealt with. The man who was sort of my opposite number, the cabinet
                    the head of what was called CNRRA, the Chinese National Relief and
                    Rehabilitation Administration, was honest and dependable He knew that I meant
                    what I said, and I knew he meant what he said. And Chiang Kai-shek himself, his
                    family and friends, were heavily corrupt. But he actually lived a very austere
                    life. For example, he'd only have three courses, he'd invite people to dinner
                    and only have three courses, when the normal thing was about 20 courses at that
                    time. We had some people in the mission who were lining their own pockets, or
                    helping their Chinese opposite numbers do so. We conducted a number of
                    investigations, and I had this authority to just say, ‚ÄúOkay, this is your last
                    day of work.‚Äù So, in most cases, I just did that. We didn't try to make a
                    federal case out of each of them because we would have done nothing else. People
                    got the idea after awhile that that was not going to be tolerated. After the
                    first few firings of that sort, that sort of thing settled down a good deal.
                    Some Chinese family members and others were really getting rich. It was
                    bothersome, but there was also nothing I could do about it. It was also helping
                    the nationalists to lose the civil war. We just had to watch and wait, rather
                    than try to mastermind the whole situation.</p>
                <p>We did have several rather dramatic incidents of confrontation. We needed to talk
                    to a delegation of Chinese communists. We wanted them to come to Shanghai. We
                    got the mayor to agree and to put them under his protection. The mayor was a
                    very good friend and a very bright figure, one of the most honest people I met
                    in China. K.C. Woo was his name. So we had this delegation come in. It was a
                    strange series of events. I made sort of a welcoming speech to my opposite
                    number in the negotiations. You could see him getting red in the face and mad at
                    what I was saying, even though I was using my most flowery language. So I
                    declared a recess and went out and talked to my Chinese assistants about what
                    was going on here. They said, ‚ÄúWell this translator is translating all of your
                    pretty words into the nastiest language he can think of as it goes through.‚Äù</p>
                <p>I learned my lesson. Everything I said would be translated by my own translator.
                    At the end of that negotiation, we said good-bye to them, and they were to leave
                    the next morning. The delegation left and it developed that their translator had
                    decamped and had turned up in Hong Kong. He was sort of the KGB guy in the
                    mission, but he decided he had had enough apparently. I never found out what
                    happened but he was obviously escaping from the communists.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>There was also a lot of what the nationalist government was doing was of course
                    deeply affected by how the war was going. It was not well. There was an incident
                    that I remember there which illustrates that. On one visit that Commander
                    Jackson came over from Washington, we managed to negotiate with the government
                    and the central bank that our proceeds of sale-fund would not be expressed in
                    local currency but in bales of cotton because we didn't want it just to
                    disappear with inflation. That was a very important invention, the proceeds of
                    sale-fund in UNRRA. That idea was that you bring in dollar goods, and the
                    government has to put the equivalent of that in local currency in a special fund
                    under the joint control of the government and the UNRRA mission. That same
                    principle was written into the Marshall Plan legislation later on. They called
                    it counterpart funds. It had a very important role to play in the Marshall Plan.
                    I must give you a copy, by the way, of a keynote speech I gave on the Marshall
                    Plan during the 50th anniversary year a couple of years ago. It explains a lot
                    of what I thought about the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we made this deal that the local currency fund would be expressed in
                    bales of cotton. Then Commander Jackson went back to Washington. I was getting
                    weekly reports from the central bank of how much money we had in there and so
                    on. I started looking at these reports very quizzically because the numbers were
                    going up so fast. I finally called up the governor at the central bank who by
                    that time was a good friend of mine, partly because I had said I didn't want the
                    house they had allocated for the chief of the UNRRA mission to live in because I
                    wanted to be downtown right near the office, living in a hotel. He turned out to
                    be the next person on the priority system, and so he got the house. So, he
                    always thought I was a good friend of his, you see. Anyway I called him up and
                    said would you look at these figures because I think there is something wrong
                    with the picture. He called back in about an hour splitting his sides with
                    laughter saying you know what happened was that I told them to make it bales of
                    cotton and I assumed it would just apply to them a normal interest rate without
                    the inflation factor. They were continuing to apply the 30% per month. He said I
                    have been doing some pencil work on my desk here, and I figure it won't be very
                    many years before UNRRA will own all of China if this goes on. He was laughing
                    and making a big joke of it. But he then told me a few weeks later about having
                    been called up to see Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the sort of summer
                    residence like Camp David in our set up. He said he was confronted there with a
                    whole plan for changing the currency. Instead of being called the Chinese
                    national currency it was going to be called the gold Yuan. They had an outside
                    consultant do this without telling the central bank about it. Then they
                    confronted the governor of the central bank with this plan. Dr. Jien Jienal, the
                    governor of the central bank, said, ‚ÄúThe Generalissimo asked me whether I
                    thought the plan would work.‚Äù I said I felt the plan would work just fine if he
                    could hold Shandong because the communists were then threatening Shandong
                    province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a peninsula that sticks out into the Yellow
                        Sea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Once they had Shandong, they would be threatening the Yangtze Valley.
                    In other words he was a banker and knew perfectly well that money was a factor
                    of confidence. So he came down and the Generalissimo decided they would change
                    the currency anyway. They changed the currency, but it didn't have very much
                    effect on the inflation. as it was bound not to.</p>
                <p>So there were many ways in which the situation in China was impacting our
                    program. We just had to weave and bob and duck to try to make sense out of the
                    really enormous bonanza we were putting into the country. It was hard to know
                    exactly what proportion of their GNP. I developed the first calculation of
                    Chinese balance of payments. We figured that about half of the balance of trade
                    at that time in '47 was actually smuggling, so there was no way to get a series
                    of figures that made any sense, that you could do the kind of planning we do
                    now.</p>
                <p>So, as you can see, it was a lively time. When there was a flood in Canton in the
                    whole Kwangtung area, the only way to find out about it was to get an airplane.
                    So we got an airplane in the morning we first heard about it, got the door taken
                    off because we could see better that way. We flew at about 500 feet all over
                    south China to get a feel for where the water had gone and how many people are
                    being displaced, and that sort of thing, and where we should try to deliver
                    food. That was all in a day's work. I have to say it was a very interesting
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in early '48. What was the reason for
                        leaving? Was it impossible to do relief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, the program was just finished. It was going to be finished in the
                    next couple of months. We worked out a way of trying to transfer to non
                    governmental organizations most of the equipment and supplies that were lying
                    around that hadn't been delivered yet, so that we wouldn't be overtly taking
                    sides in the civil war. So we worked out a transition of that program, and the
                    U.S. government at the same time was developing a new China aid program in
                    support of Chiang Kai-shek. In effect we sort of married our program to that in
                    terms of we'd stop the supply of certain kinds of equipment or certain kinds of
                    food. But the American aid program would pick it up just at the point where we
                    dropped it.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington which was the only place where I knew how to work. But
                    the UNRRA program was finished at that point. That was even the end of the UNRRA
                    agency. It was actually the largest operational thing the UN has ever done,
                    though some of the more recent peacekeeping operations may have been more
                    costly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But nothing like restoring the Yellow River to its
                        riverbed, and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: And all the stuff we did in Italy and Yugoslavia and the Ukraine, and
                    so on. It was just a gigantic operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well I was looking around for what to do, and I was hired by Paul
                    Nitze, who had a little group of consultants whose job it was to invent the
                    agency for the Marshall Plan. It was needed if the Marshall Plan went through
                    Congress. The agency that came to be called the Agency for Economic Cooperation.
                    But one of these strange things happened that happen when you are in emergency,
                    fast-moving situations. The Congress attached Title IV to the Marshall Plan
                    bill, which was called the European Recovery Act. Title IV had been aid to
                    China. We began to get queries and questions about how to handle the China aid
                    program as a part of the Marshall Plan. The first time anything with China on it
                    came through, Paul would say, ‚ÄúHarlan, you are the only person around here who
                    has even been in China. You better handle this.‚Äù So by the time the law was
                    passed, and signed on April 3, 1948, with Title IV in it, and Paul Hoffman was
                    brought down at Senator Vandenberg's suggestion, amazing bi-partisanship that
                    Truman was able to carry on in those days, even though a few months later he
                    would be beating the Republicans over the head for being a do-nothing
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ‚ÄúThe Eighty Worst Congress.‚Äù</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Right, and Truman had this very strong team of Marshall and then
                    Acheson as Secretaries of State and was extraordinarily willing to work with
                    people who started with much bigger reputations than he had. But he had a kind
                    of instinctive self confidence and common sense that carried him through that
                    period. Anyway, he appointed Paul Hoffman who had been head of the Studebaker
                    company as administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Hoffman
                    learned only when he got to Washington that he also had China, so he turned to a
                    good friend who was helping him anyway. He was a lawyer with Sullivan and
                    Cromwell. This man was helping him temporarily just to get set up. The wife of
                    this man was Henry Luce's sister. They, of course, had been brought up in China
                    and were always interested in China. Beth in fact was interested in China all
                    her life and was very active in Christianity in China issues. He asked this
                    friend of his to ask around who knows about this program and who can we get to
                    work on it. Within two or three days, I was asked to join the Marshall Plan as a
                    consultant on China. Shortly after I was made head of the China aid program.
                    What it is to have, to know something about it in a bureaucracy is a great
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: So I did that job for about a year and a half, '48 '49. During '49, of
                    course, the Chinese communists finally took over the whole mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find yourself being somewhat cautious about
                        shipping too much stuff to China because of the thought you were watching
                        the front coming and seeing how this might not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, we had to be careful about that. We were mostly helping the areas
                    that were clearly under nationalist control and Taiwan which was. But the
                    general assumption was they were going to get pushed off the mainland, so when
                    they did take over the Yangtze Valley and chased Chiang Kai-shek out, we then
                    had the very delicate problem of making sure that our people got out in time but
                    not bring them out prematurely so it would look as if we had torpedoed the
                    nationalist boat. For several years thereafter I was given credit in some of the
                    right wing magazines like Human Events for having helped lose China. The person
                    that I'd helped lose China was this Republican businessman named Paul Hoffman,
                    so the whole thing was hard to take seriously.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, that was the Joe McCarthy period. I had in my files a
                    wonderful picture, a very good photograph, of being awarded by the nationalist
                    government a high decoration when I left. The communists didn't do anything
                    similar, but the nationalists did. The picture was of Madame Chiang Kai-shek
                    pinning this medal on me with the Generalissimo standing by with a broad smile
                    on his face. I thought that at the first whisper of McCarthy trouble, I would
                    rush down to the Washington Post and give them this picture and say please print
                    it. Anyway, I never had to use it as it happened, but that story did follow me
                    around for quite awhile. Even when I came back into the government in 1961 some
                    of that was still hanging on and held up my security clearance for awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having any problems with people under you who
                        wanted to hang on until the very last in China? I mean, was there a problem
                        getting the people out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No. We had two very bright and sensible people there. The chief of our
                    mission was the former mayor of San Francisco, Roger Lapham, a very delightful
                    person, but also a very canny person. Our sort of chief operational guy had gone
                    on a mission for us to China and then was hired as my successor in what was by
                    then the Far Eastern Aid program. I'll come back to that in a minute. Those two
                    were both realistic, business oriented people with a high sense of politics. So
                    we didn't have any sort of sentimental hanging on in that business. We were very
                    much on the same wavelength.</p>
                <p>One of the things that happened while I was still responsible for the China aid
                    program was that we had to narrow our sights to concentrate just on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were you doing toward the end there to
                        help Change Kai-shek?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Importing still a lot of food, and agricultural machinery. We were
                    still supporting the dike building which hadn't been quite finished by then. We
                    had people operating in agricultural industries service all over the country. We
                    took that over as part of our program. It was a major program and we had several
                    hundred million dollars of appropriated money. When we had to narrow our program
                    to focus on Taiwan, we decided it would be a good idea to start aid programs in
                    some of the other countries around China for the political purpose of shoring up
                    any possible domino effect of the Chinese communists taking over most of China.
                    We went up to the Hill in one of the strangest things I ever saw happen in
                    government. Paul Hoffman and Dean Acheson went up to each of the four committees
                    that had authorized and appropriated money for the China aid program. I went up
                    with them carrying the briefcase, to make the case as Acheson said to one of the
                    committees, ‚ÄúWhat you really meant when you said China in this legislation was
                    the general area of China wasn't it.‚Äù Well they said, ‚ÄúI guess that is right. I
                    guess that is what we meant.‚Äù</p>
                <p>On the basis of those hearings, without any further legislation, we took a
                    hundred million dollars of our China appropriation and diverted it to the
                    Philippines which had a small program already, also Indonesia, Burma, and the
                    three associated states of Indo China as they were then being called, Vietnam,
                    Laos and Cambodia were included. We also put some more money in the Korean aid
                    program which was already a big deal. This happened before the Korean war
                    started, but there was already a sizable economic aid program in Korea, in South
                    Korea. So the far eastern aid program was formed. It included the China-Taiwan
                    responsibility and for these others as well. I was assigned to start these other
                    programs and continue to manage the China program, so I became head of the Far
                    Eastern aid program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it must have been from probably late '49 to sometime in the fall
                    of 1950. Until after the Korean war started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It started in June of 1950. Was there any sort of priority
                        for where the money would go? I mean when you were looking at this to
                        help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, the priority, of course, the biggest part of the money was going
                    to Taiwan and Korea; particularly after the North Koreans had rumbled across the
                    38th parallel in their Soviet made tanks, it became very important to shore up
                    the event as a security matter, to shore up the South Koreans with economic
                    aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>So for awhile I was responsible for a rapidly enlarging Korea aid program and a
                    still very large Taiwan program as well as for the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma
                    and so forth. The Taiwan program was being managed primarily through a thing we
                    had developed and put into the legislation the year before called the Joint
                    Commission on Rural Reconstruction which was a board of three Chinese and two
                    Americans, which had begun to operate on the rural projects on the mainland
                    quite successfully with land reforms.</p>
                <p>But when the nationalist government got onto Taiwan, they were in a shocked
                    condition. They were willing to apply much more radical measures to development.
                    We helped persuade them to start a real land reform program and to combine it
                    with a couple of other gimmicks that worked wonderfully well. The way it worked
                    out, they would take the land from the landowner and actually give it to the
                    people who were on the land doing the farming. They gave the landowner not money
                    but shares in the industrial companies. The industrial companies were all
                    nationalized, so this was before the word was invented, a privatization program.
                    The land owners were baffled to be paid with this piece of paper saying they
                    owned a machine tool company or something. So, they would stand around saying
                    anybody, ‚ÄúWant to buy this paper?‚Äù That created a capital market. So in one fell
                    swoop you had land reform, privatization of industry, and the beginnings of a
                    major capital market in Taiwan. The Joint Commission of Rural Reconstruction
                    also had a vigorous social program featuring a birth-control effort through the
                    rural health clinics that were run by the JCRR. Women could come and get
                    information and the primitive equipment that was available at the time, which
                    was mostly, if you can believe it, sponge and vinegar. That was the main thing
                    to prevent having babies. But I have really learned from that operation that if
                    women are given the chance to and the information to decide if they want to have
                    babies or not, they will definitely decide not to have so many babies because it
                    sure turned out that way in that case.</p>
                <p>The result of all these efforts in Taiwan was to make Taiwan almost a cameo case
                    of successful economic development. Even the yields of rice in Taiwan in some
                    places were better than Japan's. We had the advantage of an educated population
                    because the Japanese had been willing for the Chinese on Taiwan to be educated
                    even into higher education. Whereas, in their Korean colony, they were not
                    willing to have them get anywhere beyond elementary school. What happened in
                    Korea was that the government, as soon as they found themselves in the middle of
                    this big war, realized that it was a technological war full of military
                    technology; the generals in charge figured they had better get everybody
                    educated so they could handle this stuff. So they decreed universal education
                    for everybody up through high school and some help even for people getting into
                    college.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Two or three years later, I was no longer involved in it directly, the Korean
                    government of the day which was still dominated by the military decided they
                    really didn't need to spend all this money on education now because the war had
                    tapered off. So, they tried to turn it off. By that time the parents in South
                    Korea had unanimously come to the conclusion that all their children were going
                    to go to college, and it was just politically impossible to turn off. The result
                    of that mandated universal education was like the result of a similar policy in
                    the early 19th century in the United States. We became a great country not
                    because of the amber waves of grain so much as because we were an educated
                    population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The land grant colleges and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The land grant colleges, the extension services, and all that. It was
                    an information revolution before its time anyway. In the same way in Korea,
                    South Koreans went from being a very underdeveloped country. My deputy in the
                    far eastern program was a man who, as it happened, had been born in North Korea
                    of missionary parents. He used to kid us saying if they were going to give us
                    half of Korea to work with, why didn't they give us the decent half, the iron
                    and the coal and all that wonderful stuff up there. It turned out that it wasn't
                    the iron and coal but the people's minds that were the real development
                    resource. Less than 50 years later, 47 or 48 years later, after the war, Korea
                    became the first really developing country to become a member of the OECD, the
                    club of rich countries. Education was the key to that extraordinary
                    development.</p>
                <p>So then I left the Far Eastern program. We recruited my successor, a man from
                    California who was running the Monterey Peninsula Herald who had worked with me
                    in the China aid program. I was promoted to be deputy assistant administrator. I
                    was deputy to Dick Bissell, who was the chief program officer for the whole
                    Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in late 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: This would have been late 1950. I'll have to go back and find out just
                    how those dates go. From then on I was working primarily on Europe because that
                    was what most of the agency was working on. In fact my last year in the program
                    they changed the name of the agency from the Foreign Economic Administration to
                    the Mutual Security Agency for political reasons, to show that we were part of
                    the defense program.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Hoffman had left, and Averell Harriman was now the head of it and was also an
                    assistant to President Truman. His office was actually over in the White House,
                    and I was one of the assistant directors under him. My job title was Assistant
                    Director for Europe, which meant that at least nominally I was in charge of the
                    Washington end of the Marshall Plan in its fourth and final year. All through
                    the period when I was working with Dick Bissell, anything that came along that
                    had to do with the developing world, whether it was the overseas territories of
                    the European countries, we had one division for overseas territories, or whether
                    it was Korea or Taiwan or these other places, anything that came up that wasn't
                    Europe was automatically delegated to me to worry about. Everybody in the ECA
                    was focused on monetary problems in Europe and the huge amount of aid that was
                    going to Europe, five billion dollars in the first year, 13 billion dollars
                    altogether that was transferred to Europe in the four year period. I commuted to
                    Paris some and got to know the European program very well, of course. But I was
                    still the person in the agency who was looked to for insight about the
                    non-European parts of the program, the other precincts as it were, the outlying
                    precincts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get hit by Joseph McCarthy and company? You
                        said you'd been accused. About this time, they were looking for subversives?
                        Did you get into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I didn't get into it, somewhat surprising actually, because I
                    had China written all over my rÔøΩsumÔøΩ. On the other hand I had been managing a
                    major program of aid to Chiang Kai-shek's government, so I couldn't be said to
                    be exactly unsympathetic to the Chinese nationalists. McCarthy wasn't worried
                    about distinctions like that of course. Several people that I knew quite well
                    were hauled up in front of that committee, but I never had occasion to use that
                    photograph.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Averell Harriman as a boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He was a very interesting person: very bright, curiously diffident. I
                    somehow never expected a man with that much money to be diffident. But a very
                    good understanding of international economics and international politics. He
                    later, of course, became ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually, he had been ambassador in Moscow towards
                        the end of the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I can't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may be wrong but I think he was at Yalta.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That's right. He was at Yalta, he had that experience before. But I
                    was thinking later in the Kennedy administration he was brought in as an
                    ambassador at large and then as assistant secretary for far east. I find he was
                    very good to work for. He was preoccupied with high policy in the President's
                    office. He had been, of course, in charge of the Marshall Plan in Europe, in the
                    regional office in Paris. But that regional office was no longer as powerful or
                    as competitive as Washington for power, as it had been when Averell Harriman was
                    there and Paul Hoffman was home. I found that he was very willing to delegate
                    the day-to-day operations. In 1952, in my last year after the Mutual Security
                    Agency was set up, I was made assistant director for Europe. I was asked in
                    addition to that to be in charge of the total congressional presentation for the
                    whole agency, including all the outlying precincts. I spent a lot of time
                    mobilizing testimony and testifying myself, and so forth, on the Hill that last
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with Europe, I would have thought there would
                        have been a couple of concerns that would have been difficult. One was the
                        British. I mean their whole system didn't seem to take to this very well.
                        Maybe I am wrong, but they seemed to have a much slower recovery than
                        anybody else did. The other one would be the French, and the French always
                        go their own way. Did you have these problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, it was interesting that the relationship with the British was in
                    a way the best because the British knew they had never lost control of their
                    country, and they weren't about to delegate to any American mission the job of
                    helping them decide what was going to be done. For example, on the counterpart
                    fund in Britain, they would come to our mission chief who was Tom Finletter, and
                    say here is our budget for next year. ‚ÄúTo which parts of our budget would you
                    like to attribute the counterpart funds?‚Äù They might even say things like ‚Äúwhich
                    pieces of our budget do you think might be most popular on Capitol Hill because
                    that is where you are going with it, we know.‚Äù Whereas, the French had a
                    different problem. They were running a deficit in their budget. One way of
                    financing the deficit in the budget was to go to the General Assembly and ask
                    for an increase in the debt limit. Another easier way they thought was to come
                    to the U.S. mission and say, ‚ÄúWhy don't we take your counterpart fund, or part
                    of it, and use it to finance the deficit in our budget?‚Äù David Bruce who was our
                    mission chief there would say, ‚ÄúWell, that is an interesting idea, but first we
                    have to look at your whole budget, don't we?‚Äù In effect, they sold David Bruce a
                    chair at their budget table. Nobody raised any sovereignty problems or anything
                    like that because something more important was at stake.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I talked about this a little bit in this speech on the 50th anniversary Marshall
                    Plan. I'll give you a copy because it might even be worth attaching to this. In
                    some of the other countries, by contrast, the counterpart funds were a very
                    important way of getting things done where there wasn't political support in the
                    country. Like helping the South of Italy, the Mezzogiorno; or developing
                    educational programs in Greece; even some propaganda about the Marshall Plan
                    itself was financed by counterpart funds. The counterpart funds were a very
                    versatile and flexible instrument that operated in different ways in almost
                    every country where we had missions.</p>
                <p>I also emphasize in that writing how very important the decision was early on in
                    the Marshall Plan to delegate to the Europeans as a group the task of deciding
                    who should get how much money among the countries. In order to do that, they
                    would hold hearings. I attended a couple of those hearings and was enormously
                    impressed with the effect of that decision because it meant that each country
                    had a right to intervene in the other countries and criticize their management.
                    I was at one meeting when the Italians were on the griddle. The other countries
                    were saying you are obviously discriminating against the Mezzogiorno, the south
                    of the country, in favor of the Po valley and so on. I expected the Italians to
                    say we can't discuss that. That is about our national sovereignty. Nobody
                    mentioned national sovereignty. Now when the French were on the griddle, the big
                    issue of the time was the enormous deficit the French national railroad, the
                    Chemins de Fer FranÔøΩais, was running. I remember one of the critics from one of
                    the other countries asked why the French national railroad runs such a big
                    deficit? ‚ÄúThe rest of us have railroads and we know how to run a railroad; why
                    don't you know how to run a railroad?‚Äù I expected the senior French
                    representative to say stop, enough. We can't discuss this. Instead the senior
                    Frenchman sat quiet while the expert on transportation tried the best he could
                    to decide why they were having all these cost overruns. I learned an important
                    lesson on the limits to sovereignty in that relationship. Also I might mention,
                    I also got to know Jean Monnet a little. My younger brother was in the Foreign
                    Service and worked for him for a year and a half or so. For years after that we
                    were on that select but large list of people who every Christmas got a bottle of
                    Monnet cognac from that vineyard. I learned some things from him about the
                    origins of the European Union experiment. His own biography, of which there is a
                    good English translation, is one of the most illuminating books about public
                    administration there is in the literature, I think. We used to assign it in our
                    leadership program in Minnesota.</p>

                        Soviet threat play a role in your decisions?</hi>

                <p>CLEVELAND: In the Marshall Plan?</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, the rhetorical stance was taken from Marshall's speech which was
                    this policy is not directed against any country, or anybody else. It is only
                    directed against hunger, disease, and all that. But in fact, during the same
                    period the cold war was starting, and the NATO treaty was being developed. It
                    was finally adopted in 1949. That was April, 1949, early, just about a year
                    after the Marshall Plan had gone through. A lot of what was done in the Marshall
                    Plan was helping to win the cold war clearly. We were propping up the Italians
                    when they were coming up to the 1948 elections. That certainly helped the
                    Christian Democrats and their allies to get in and the communists to fall short
                    of what looked at one point as though they might get a majority. Both in France
                    and in Italy the communist parties were very large mass parties, and were
                    threatening to become majorities and actually form governments in the popular
                    front. The Soviets were obviously betting on the communist parties in western
                    Europe. I don't think we had any doubt in our minds that part of why we were
                    doing this was anti-communist, and indeed that was an important factor in
                    getting this huge aid program through Congress from the outset. But the
                    rhetorical fact was that Hoffman was always very clear about this, that we are
                    helping people to develop and grow, and we are not in this international
                    politics business. But we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this might be a good place to stop now because you
                        left this in 1952, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I left in '52 when Eisenhower was elected. Adlai Stevenson was not
                    elected. Although I was a civil servant and I had been handling the whole
                    congressional presentation and so forth, I didn't think it was reasonable to
                    suppose that I was not a Democratic partisan, and if I slopped over into a
                    Republican administration, I would be tagged as a Democrat. I might as well get
                    out, so I resigned to Harriman after the election and before the new
                    administration came in. I was asked to stay for a few weeks, and I got to know
                    Stassen at that time when he came in to be head of the AID program. But since I
                    already had a job in New York, and I was on the way out, they didn't have to
                    pursue any measures to get rid of me.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: '53 actually, early '53. I had a friend, an Italian refugee named Max
                    Ascoli, who had married Marion Rosenwald, one of the five children of Julius
                    Rosenwald, and was thus a millionaire many times over. He had started a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was getting it in Korea as an enlisted man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Really? For goodness sake. It had started in 1949. I had seen Max
                    occasionally, and every time he had said, you know, whenever you leave the
                    government, I want you to come and join me. Not knowing how difficult he would
                    be to work for, I always stored that up as a safe bet. In fact, when I decided
                    after the election to do something else, I talked to him about it and he
                    immediately reiterated the offer. I went up there to be his deputy, in effect to
                    be executive editor. But then later I also became publisher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we pick it up then at that time. 1953, you
                        told how you had gotten on The Reporter and we'll pick it up at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***Today is April 21, 1999. Why was The Reporter such an important magazine at
                    its time? It has disappeared from view, but for a few years it was sort of a
                    major intellectual magazine.</p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was, and we had a big circulation for a magazine of opinion
                    or as we called it a magazine of facts and ideas. We considered our main
                    competition to be Saturday Review, Harpers, The Atlantic, not so much New
                    Republic and Nation. Partly it succeeded because it had a number of excellent
                    people in it, editors and writers, and partly because it was produced with some
                    pretty fancy technology. I mean it had four color covers and that sort of thing
                    which was very unusual for political journals at that time. It wasn't what its
                    inventor and editor-in-chief, Max Ascoli, said he was doing ‚Äî which was
                    producing an American version of The Economist. He wasn't interested enough in
                    economics for that. But it was in its time, I think, the best of the journals of
                    facts and ideas, and for most of the time I was there, especially the time I was
                    publisher when I was mixing with the magazine business people. It was clear that
                    our renewal rate, and our conversion rate from short term to long term were the
                    highest of any magazine. We had something like an 80% renewal rate which was
                    phenomenal, and we were almost 50% on conversion which was also phenomenal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were doing this from '53 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since the thrust of my interviews is concerned with
                        foreign affairs, were there any particular lines that an opinion maker
                        journal, whatever you want to call it, that you were taking as far as
                        foreign affairs went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: We were internationalist of course, Max Ascoli had been an Italian
                    refugee who married one of Julius Rosenwald's daughters, Marion. Together they
                    were therefore millionaires. This was something he wanted to do, so we staked
                    him to it. He was always interested in international affairs, so a lot of our
                    coverage was international affairs. For a time we had Teddy White, Theodore H.
                    White, as our European correspondent. We had several well known writers who
                    wrote from different parts of the world. It was an exciting time. I once asked
                    Teddy how come he wrote for The Reporter. Here was a guy who could write an
                    article for Look or Life and get $5,000 an article. He said, ‚ÄúWell, you know, I
                    write some of the stuff I really want to write for you. Then when I run out of
                    money, I wrote an article for Look or Life and get $5,000 for it. It is not a
                    bad way to live.‚Äù</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was '53-'56. The McCarthy years were still
                        going. They were beginning to go down. How did the magazine do vis-a-vis
                        McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Our editor-in-chief was anti-McCarthy from the word go. He used to say
                    that we were prematurely anti-McCarthy. We ran a wonderful lead piece by Anthony
                    Lewis. It was called ‚ÄúVictim of Nameless Accusers,‚Äù and it was a very powerful
                    piece about one of the people who had been fingered by McCarthy. We ran quite a
                    lot of stuff of that kind at that time. I think we were part of what turned out
                    to be a growing wave of resentment of McCarthy's way of behaving which
                    eventually brought him down, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself, you joined just when the
                        Eisenhower administration came in, and this being a Republican
                        administration, and The Reporter's thrust was more on the Democratic side?
                        Did you find yourself, you might say, frozen out from government circles?
                        How do you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: We were not really trying to be insiders on government anyway. We had
                    sources of all sorts. We had Doug Kater as our Washington correspondent. His
                    assistant was Meg Greenfield who now runs the editorial page for the Washington
                    Post. They had plenty of entree for journalists. We did a number of sort of
                    exposÔøΩs and investigative journalism on what was going on in the Eisenhower
                    administration. They put me to working on the business side also. We had just
                    bought a business, and part of buying a business was to collect back from the
                    treasury the taxes the business had paid for the last two years, offset against
                    our losses. It was a wonderful day when the check arrived from the U.S. Treasury
                    on my desk, the same day that our issue of The Reporter came out on the news
                    stands saying what a lousy job the Secretary of the Treasury was doing in the
                    Eisenhower administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>So we had a lot of long range tussles with leaders in the Republican party. The
                    senator from New Hampshire was the Senate minority leader. His name I can't
                    remember at the moment. We did a very long article about the whole of his life,
                    really. He threatened publicly to sue us. I went down that afternoon because Max
                    was in Europe, so I was kind of in charge, to my lawyer's office, a man named
                    Fowler Hamilton whom I knew very well from the government before, to ask him
                    what was involved in this, if he did sue us. He said, ‚ÄúWell, the first thing
                    that would be involved would be we'd spend two or three years with pre-trial
                    depositions, and since the article talks about everything, we could keep that
                    going for months and months. In fact I'll guarantee you'll triple your
                    circulation if he sues.‚Äù At the end of the conversation I said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bridges. Lloyd Bridges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Not Lloyd, it was something Bridges [Henry Styles Bridges]. He was on
                    the fringe of the China lobby and so on. At the end of the conversation I said,
                    ‚ÄúI guess, Fowler, that Senator Bridges is having the same conversation with his
                    lawyer, and his lawyer is telling him the same thing, right.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYes, I'm
                    afraid so, and he won't sue us.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Nobody ever did sue us, at least in my time and I don't think ever, partly
                    because we had a very tough review system. We had two young people who did
                    nothing but read what we might publish, circle every statement of fact, and try
                    to establish it independently of the author. If they couldn't then go back to
                    the author and find out why. As a result, we didn't get into some of the
                    troubles that investigative journals have gotten in more recent years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1956 what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I'd signed on as Ascoli's deputy with the kind of idea that I
                    would be his successor because he had cataracts; he was having difficulty
                    seeing. He wasn't feeling well, and it looked as if there would be a succession.
                    By 1956, the cataracts were operated on very successfully. It looked as if it
                    would go on for a long time under his leadership. I was in the process of
                    concluding that he probably didn't know what a successor was and he certainly
                    didn't know what a deputy was.</p>
                <p>During that time, I attended a conference on the American political executive
                    held in Philadelphia. I was one of the main speakers. I wrote, spent a lot of
                    time working on a long paper about the American public executive, which if I say
                    so myself was quite a good paper. I gave this paper as an after-dinner talk at
                    this conference. Right after that, a man whom I hadn't known well but whom I did
                    know, Paul Appleby, who was dean of the Maxwell School at Syracuse University,
                    had formerly been Under Secretary of Agriculture and Deputy Director of the
                    Budget in the Truman administration, or the Roosevelt administration I guess
                    before that. He saddled up to me and said why don't you succeed me at Syracuse,
                    just like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Averell Harriman had been elected governor of New York and had asked him to come
                    as his budget director. He wanted to do that and that was going to create a
                    vacancy in this job. It was a very good job in the academic firmament.</p>
                <p>The Maxwell Graduate School of Citizenship and Public Affairs was then and is
                    today the premier graduate school focusing on public administration. They had
                    decided they wanted a practitioner, so despite the fact that I had no academic
                    work in back of me, after the usual meeting and greeting and so on, I was asked
                    to come up there as Appleby's successor as dean of the school. There was a
                    little glitch because they didn't realize that I didn't have a Ph.D. When I came
                    back form Oxford, there was the war and I had never pursued graduate work beyond
                    that. But they finally swallowed that and made me a full professor, with tenure,
                    after which nobody could say I wasn't an academic. I have told young people
                    since then that the way to get ahead in academia is to start as a full professor
                    with tenure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that sounds like very good advice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: So that was a major switch. I had been negotiating with the Carnegie
                    Corporation, John Gardner and Jim Perkins, about taking a year off and doing a
                    Carnegie study about Americans abroad and how they ought to be educated. So when
                    the Syracuse job was firm I called up Jim Perkins who was the vice president of
                    the Carnegie Corporation and said, ‚ÄúIt looks like we can't do this thing because
                    I am going to go off and take this job.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúDo you think it would be a
                    disadvantage to arrive up there with a $175,000 grant from Carnegie in your
                    pocket?‚Äù</p>
                <p>That was a lot of money in those days for a grant. I said, ‚ÄúNo, I don't suppose
                    it would be.‚Äù It turned out the money the school had been living on which was
                    the earnings from a synthetic textile plant that Mr. Maxwell had owned. He was a
                    patent lawyer and wound up with the patent. Anyway, he was not an engineer or
                    entrepreneur, and the rest of the industry went past that patent, and the funds
                    trickled out. The funds for the Maxwell School trickled out just the year before
                    I got there, so having a major grant in my pocket as it were, gave me the chance
                    to encourage the faculty to go looking for grants. We got very much at the
                    foundation trough after that. It was a lot of fun, that project, three of us
                    doing it on the faculty. We got all over the world and hired some very good
                    researchers. One of our researchers was Lou Harris, the pollster, just as he had
                    broken off from Roper and was starting his own firm. We were his first client
                    really. He helped us set up the research on the basis we had in depth interviews
                    with 244 people in six countries. Then one of my colleagues, Gerard Mangone,
                    went around the world talking with non-Americans about the Americans, not only
                    in those six countries but in about six other countries as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you are saying Americans abroad you are meaning
                        Americans who are working abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Living and working abroad. About a third of them were government
                    people, about a third were business people, and about a third were in missionary
                    societies. Just before I left the Maxwell School in '61, in 1960, McGraw Hill
                    publishing company published a major book called The Overseas Americans which
                    was my first hard cover book by the three of us. I was the senior author. It was
                    used for years in training programs, and so forth, after that. You know, for a
                    book like that, it was quite successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the three of you find where was the greatest
                        problem in how Americans were educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, apparently it was that going abroad was a family affair. It was
                    usually a joint decision between the man and his wife. We found that the wives
                    made about two-thirds of the decisions to come home and at least half of the
                    decisions to go, so they were much more important in the scheme of things than
                    any of the organizations sending people realized. We also found to our surprise
                    that it was only the missionary folks who actually knew how many people there
                    were abroad in their category. There was nobody who knew how many business
                    people there were abroad, and the government was divided up into so many
                    agencies that nobody was keeping track. So we finally produced some numbers
                    which were used for a decade or a decade and a half after that. They were the
                    only numbers around. It came out to almost exactly one percent of the American
                    population was living and working abroad. As I went up there to be dean of this
                    already successful graduate school, and found that the dean of the Maxwell
                    School was not only dean of the graduate school, he was also dean of all the
                    social sciences at the undergraduate level. That meant and accounted for why
                    each one of the social science departments was particularly strong on the
                    government related activity and expertise. Whenever we needed a new professor in
                    a department, as the dean I had some say in what kind of person we were going to
                    look for. I was always pushing for people who had government experience and
                    would be able to help in the public administration program which I conceived of
                    as a cross disciplinary program. It was the star program of the school. There
                    were several excellent departments including political science, economics, and
                    anthropology, history. But, we were a national player in the production of
                    people whose next job was working in a government agency somewhere, at all
                    levels from city to national.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that the school was called upon to
                        produce speakers, think tank people and that sort of thing? I mean was there
                        a pretty strong relationship between the government and the university, the
                        Maxwell School as far as commissions, studies, and the like?</hi>

                <p>CLEVELAND: Quite a lot. Among other things, we were a think-tank on public
                    affairs. For example, we conducted for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a
                    huge study of the way in which the domestic and international parts of the
                    foreign policy could be glued together better. I did a major piece on foreign
                    aid at one point, looking at it from outside the government. Yes, there was a
                    good deal of that. Increasingly graduates of the Maxwell School, usually after
                    some experience in government, the more reflective ones would wind up at
                    Brookings or in the other Washington think-tanks or in comparable institutions
                    in some of the state capitals. It was clear that a whole community was building.
                    It was in the early stages of building at that point. Brookings was one of the
                    earliest ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you at the Maxwell School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: A little less than five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this takes you up to '61 or so. One of the important
                        elections was the 1960 election with Kennedy versus Nixon. There was a
                        change of administration, but it did seem to invigorate the university
                        academic world to get more involved in government. Was that operating in
                        your impression at the Maxwell School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Very much so. I got quite deeply into it. I guess I was a relatively
                    prominent upstate Democrat and it was not that hard to do in those days. There
                    weren't that many Democrats. I sent one graduate student down to the library
                    downtown to look up when Onondaga county, the county that Syracuse is in, last
                    went for a Democratic president. He came back his face wreathed in smiles. He
                    said, ‚ÄúYou really want to know the answer to that question?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI
                    certainly do.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThere was a fellow named Franklin Pierce a hundred and
                    some years ago.‚Äù</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I, in fact, had been approached whether I would run for Congress that year in the
                    Syracuse area. I considered it, but I decided I didn't really want to do
                    elective politics. If I had a chance to go back into the administration as a
                    political appointee, I would like to do that. I kind of had my heart set on that
                    in fact. I got active in the Democratic Party in the upstate area, and I was
                    appointed by the state committee to one of the slots on the convention
                    delegation that didn't have to be run for. You know, there were people like Mrs.
                    Roosevelt that they didn't want to have to run. I got one of those slots. So
                    Lois and I went out to Los Angeles and had a wonderful time for a week going to
                    everybody's cocktail parties and finding out how this worked from the inside. We
                    were all Kennedy delegates. That had been decided before, but I was getting a
                    lot of pressure as were some of the others on the delegation, from people who
                    were in favor of Adlai Stevenson who had run twice, of course. They thought this
                    maybe was the time for him. The thing was that Adlai himself had not decided
                    that he wanted to run. It came to a head one evening at the convention. He had
                    gone on the stage and gotten a huge ovation from the assembled multitudes. That
                    evening a number of us were asked to come up to Bill Benton's suite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Benton being the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He owned the Encyclopedia Britannica, and was a wealthy magnate. He
                    was also a vice president of the University of Chicago. We found ourselves at
                    one of these ongoing cocktail parties that went on and on and on. The leader of
                    our little group who was the Democratic leader of Nassau county said to
                    Stevenson, ‚ÄúWell, Governor, what do you want us to do tomorrow?‚Äù Tomorrow was
                    the nominations for President. Stevenson surprised us all by saying you are just
                    going to have to make up your own minds about that. Even at that point he was
                    not saying he was a candidate.</p>
                <p>So, most of them drifted away; Lois and I stayed around for awhile and found
                    ourselves off in a corner with Adlai Stevenson. He said to me, ‚ÄúYou know, it is
                    kind of embarrassing. Bill Benton asked me to come up here tonight, but I didn't
                    know it was going to be a pitch for votes.‚Äù I said to myself, my god what does
                    he think is a pitch for at the convention the night before the voting. Anyway,
                    I'd known Adlai before because we tried to persuade him to become editor in
                    chief of Reporter Magazine.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>This is a little known incident, but he was seriously considering getting out of
                    politics, and saying that he was going to do something else in 1955. We offered
                    him a chance to become editor in chief. Remain in Chicago, if you like. I would
                    be sort of the liaison back and forth and help him. He would write a column. It
                    was really something for Max Ascoli to relinquish the editor in chiefship. The
                    whole purpose of this being to prevent him from being swallowed up in the 1956
                    campaign where he would have to run against Eisenhower and almost certainly
                    lose. The scheme finally fell through and he decided not to do it. So I got to
                    know him a little bit in that connection though I had never actually worked for
                    him in a campaign. Later on we'll get to the later on story where he decided he
                    wanted me to come to Washington. That is how I got back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I, like so many other people, had been entranced by
                        Stevenson. I became a very firm Stevenson reporter, but I must say the more
                        I heard, well disenchanted, maybe it is the right word. The problem was one
                        of making up one's mind. This seemed almost a major flaw in somebody who was
                        going to be in an executive position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, that was a general impression about him. My impression after
                    working with him closely for about five years when he was Ambassador to the UN ‚Äî
                    and I was at the State Department on the other end of his telephone line ‚Äî he
                    had no difficulty making up his mind on policy issues. The only thing he had
                    difficulty making up his mind on was himself, what he was going to do and so on.
                    I rather concluded after the fact, after he died, that it wouldn't have worked
                    very well because, at the level of president, you can't make that distinction
                    between yourself and the policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything is personal. You were saying that as president,
                        the personal and the policy became one in the same almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, the Readers Digest asked me after he died, they wanted to do a
                    most unforgettable man story about Stevenson. Since they were paying $5,000 for
                    writing it, it seemed like an interesting thing to do. But I decided I'd have to
                    say what I just said to you. I didn't want to throw water on his ashes as it
                    were, so I decided not to take that assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a Kennedy delegate, did you get involved, or
                        let's say a close look at Bobby Kennedy, and how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Somewhat, yes. More in the campaign that followed than at the
                    convention. In the campaign I was appointed chairman of Citizens for Kennedy for
                    the upstate part of New York where I was, and gave office space to the regular
                    campaign's regional man. It was a man from Wisconsin who thought he had
                    recruited me to be the head of the Citizens for Kennedy ‚Äî when he came to my
                    living room one day he said, ‚ÄúWell, Mr. Cleveland, you know what we are looking
                    for. We are looking for a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.‚Äù He sort of talked that
                    way. Anyway, because in Syracuse, there were Irish and there were Germans and
                    Italians, and I had to not be one of those categories if you were going to work
                    with everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this man was looking to make, you had already...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, actually I had already accepted. My classmate at Oxford, Byron
                    White, who later became a Supreme Court Justice and has recently retired, who
                    was a great football player, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ‚ÄúWhizzer White,‚Äù yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: ‚ÄúWhizzer‚Äù White. He was made the national head of Citizens for
                    Kennedy. It had already been arranged that I would be the man there locally. So,
                    I was quite heavily involved in the campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any problem with the university, Syracuse University doing
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No. In fact, it was rather expected that our faculty would be active
                    in public affairs in one way or another. Appleby had gone from that to working
                    for Harriman. We had accepted all of Harriman's papers when he stopped being
                    governor, and hired Pat Moynihan as a faculty member as a part of the deal. That
                    was actually his first academic job. He was a delightful colleague. He didn't
                    have his Ph.D. yet. I felt badly on pressing him to finish his Ph.D. at Tufts
                    University. We hired him as an assistant professor and we usually didn't hire an
                    assistant professor unless they already had their Ph.D. He did in fact do it
                    that year. Later on when he was in the Nixon White House and everybody was
                    addressing him as Dr. Moynihan, I felt I had done something for my country.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I was very much involved in the campaign. We did very well there. We
                    didn't quite carry Onondaga country, but we did carry Syracuse. Two years later,
                    the Democratic congressional candidate won the seat from the Syracuse area. That
                    has been I believe, a Democratic seat ever since. We had a whole storefront
                    setup downtown in which we propagandized, and I got to know something of the way
                    the regular campaign was working which was being run by Bobby Kennedy.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>We had some tensions between the two kind of campaigns. We were trying to appeal
                    to independents and liberal Republicans and so on. Also, I was homing in on the
                    question of how to handle foreign policy in the campaign. I went over one time
                    to pick up Bob Kennedy where he was making a speech in a nearby town and was
                    then coming to us for a baked bean supper which was one of the things they did
                    in those days for a New England candidate. I had given this memorandum to the
                    campaign on foreign policy. What I heard him saying was not what I thought we
                    ought to be saying about it. I undertook to discuss the matter with him in the
                    car. At one point in the middle of one of my sentences he leans over and turns
                    the radio music on loud so that we couldn't converse anymore. I said to myself
                    well, gee, you know, I am trying hard to elect this guy's brother President of
                    the United States, so he could at least be polite, but he wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is not being polite but also not listening. A
                        very unappealing person from what I have heard. I never bought this idea
                        that he somehow turned into a warm, soft, caring person later on. It may
                        have happened, I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: He certainly developed a line of talking about policy that was very
                    much more liberal later on when he was running himself. Arthur Schlesinger wrote
                    a whole book about his conversion and so on, but I didn't see it so... He
                    actually held up my appointment later on for about a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel there were foreign policy differences
                        between Nixon and Kennedy that were during the campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, I didn't think that there were huge problems. They were both
                    relatively hawkish. In fact Kennedy had come out rather strongly on issues like
                    Algeria that weren't exactly on every voter's mind. But on the big issues about
                    the Cold War and so on, the Democratic problem was just not to look soft because
                    that was always the charge coming from the Republicans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Kennedy was elected. His administration came in in
                        January, 1961. Were you looking towards getting involved there at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I was assuming I would be involved somehow, especially after all
                    of the main people he was picking for foreign policy jobs were friends of mine,
                    Dean Rusk, Chester Bowles, George Ball. I hadn't known McNamara.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harriman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Harriman was brought in in sort of a peculiar way, not on a line job.
                    But, one day Adlai Stevenson called from Chicago and said would I come out and
                    visit him because he wanted to talk about the deal he had made with Kennedy
                    having been passed over as President and then Secretary of State. He was offered
                    the Ambassadorship to the UN. He had made several conditions, one of which was
                    that he would get to suggest who would be the person in the State Department
                    that he would be dealing with. He knew me better than I thought he did; that is
                    he read more of my writing than I had realized, and we spent most of a day
                    together talking about the UN and foreign policy and so forth. He was convinced
                    that I should be in that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about assistant secretary for
                        international organizations known as IO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: IO, yes. And so still nothing was happening, and I wasn't getting any
                    news. Then out of the blue, I get a call from Dean Rusk whom I knew. He had
                    offered me a job when he was head of the Rockefeller foundation, but I had
                    decided I was having more fun spending foundation money than giving it away. I
                    always thought he would be someone I'd like to work for. He called and said
                    there seem to be two ideas about me. One is to head the AID program, which was
                    sort of an under secretary job. AID was then called ICA, but the agency still
                    exists as the Agency for International Development. The other was to be in IO,
                    the backstop for the UN delegation but also the supervisor for delegations to a
                    number of other international organizations. I told Dean Rusk that if I were the
                    administration, I think I would put me in the AID job because I used to do that
                    sort of thing, and I knew a lot about it, and had worked on foreign economic
                    policy a lot.</p>
                <p>But if he were asking me what I would like to do, I would like to take a crack at
                    political diplomacy and therefore the UN thing would be much more interesting.
                    He said, ‚ÄúWell, I will try to make it come out that way, and that was the way it
                    came out.‚Äù Except that when I got down there three days after the inauguration I
                    did something you wouldn't do nowadays I don't think. I just moved into the
                    Assistant Secretary's office on the assumption that I was going to be that. This
                    was even before I was nominated, let alone confirmed. It turned out there was a
                    glitch, and the glitch was that Bobby Kennedy was objecting. That took about a
                    month to work out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the objection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I never really figured it out, and Dean Rusk never really said. One,
                    there was a good deal of right wing stuff going around about stuff that the
                    people who had ‚Äúlost China,‚Äù the previous generation. I was sort of on that list
                    as having helped Paul Hoffman lose China. I thought for a Republican automobile
                    manufacturer to be accused of losing China was a little much but the fact that
                    whatever he had done, if I had helped him it was a good thing. Anyway, so there
                    was that China problem. I mentioned to you I had in my file a nice glossy
                    photograph of Madame Chiang Kai-shek pinning a medal on me when I left China for
                    the UNRRA position. And the Generalissimo was standing by smiling. For a scene
                    of real trouble, I was going to go down to the Washington Post and ask them to
                    publish it. I never had that problem during the McCarthy period, and I didn't
                    really get to that although some of the security people were questioning my
                    security clearance on this China history grounds.</p>
                <p>Also, a man in the regular campaign who had an office with us apparently had
                    reported that we had hidden a lot of Democratic propaganda and had been
                    unwilling to distribute it and so forth, which was not true, but that is the way
                    this kind of word gets around. Anyway, the older brother finally had to overrule
                    the younger brother, and my nomination was sent up to the Hill. There was no
                    particular problem about confirmation. Nobody raised any of these questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What at that echelon, at the assistant secretary level,
                        which is the policy level of the Department of State, what was the
                        atmosphere when the Kennedy administration came in? Was it going to make
                        some real changes or carry on or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No it was very creative. We all thought we were there to do what
                    needed to be done and not very much had been done during the Eisenhower
                    administration which was a static period of foreign policy. We had one of the
                    world's great men up in New York as our gladiator and built a very strong staff
                    under him. I had a very strong staff of Foreign Service people. We felt it was
                    our task to come up with ideas and push them and do new things. We did that all
                    through the period I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: From January or February '61 until the fall of 1965, not quite five
                    years, well past the assassination of Kennedy. As for the rest of the
                    department, it depended really on who was doing what, but I think the general
                    feeling was one of feistiness. Imagination was being rewarded and that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>

                        operate? Were there any problems sort of adjusting to this relationship
                        between your work in Washington and their work up in the United
                        Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, there was a long history of the mission to the United Nations.
                    It was going to be my job to provide Adlai Stevenson and his colleagues with
                    instructions from the government, from the White House and the State Department
                    on what they could say and what they couldn't say. I hired one man full time as
                    a writer who worked as a special assistant. His full-time job was writing things
                    for Adlai Stevenson to say. He was a brilliant writer, Thomas W. Wilson, Jr. So,
                    whenever there was any major policy speech at the UN, he would be one of the
                    main writers on it. I did quite a lot of writing for Stevenson. I came to
                    realize that one of the reasons he wanted me in the job was that he liked my
                    writing and wanted me to be available for ghosting purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Stevenson had a reputation, during his political
                        campaigns, of working on many of his own speeches.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, he worked on his own speeches, but I came to the conclusion that
                    he hated to write; he loved to edit. When he had a big speech to make somewhere,
                    he'd ask two, three or four people to write it for him. After awhile I got to
                    know what that circle was, Barbara Ward and Clayton Fritchey in his own office,
                    and one or two others. So, I would consult around with them as to which of us
                    was really going to write it because it was too much lost work for everybody to
                    be writing it. Whenever he got a text, he would invariably improve it. He was a
                    brilliant editor. In the almost five years I worked for him, I could only
                    identify two or three things he started from scratch himself. That didn't mean
                    he didn't make them his by the time they were in final form; they were very much
                    his words.</p>
                <p>We got immediately into crisis mode because we had that Angola issue, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bay of Pigs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Before that even, we had the Congo which had busted loose. There was a
                    UN force already there, so the big part of my job for the first few months was
                    nursing the Congo operation, nursing the American support for the Congo
                    operation. I went to the Congo myself a couple of times, once to develop an
                    initial aid program, and once to learn just how the peacekeeping thing worked on
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, particularly there was a real concentration around
                        Elizabethville. What did the UN troops do there? They were being pretty
                        heavily pressed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, they were. The country was splitting into three parts. There was
                    a fellow named Patrice Lumumba, who was sort of the left wing. There was a man
                    named Abdullah in the middle in what was then called Leopoldville, now Kinshasa.
                    Then there was Tshombe in the south in Katanga who had a very powerful
                    gendarmerie, which was kind of a private army. He was being supported by the
                    Belgian mining interests and others who had interests there. They were being
                    supported in turn by some American senators and others. Senator Dodd, the father
                    of the current Senator, was very much in favor of the Belgian view of that whole
                    situation. So, they were constantly having trouble on the Hill about the Congo.
                    We had developed a policy that said we were going to support the UN force
                    because the UN force was frustrating the Soviets and, to some extent, the
                    Chinese initiatives for trying to get influence in central Africa.</p>
                <p>So, we were back into the White House every couple of weeks with the President on
                    this issue. He would say to me, ‚ÄúHarlan, I remember you saying that if the UN
                    wasn't in there, we'd probably have to be in there ourselves. Is that still
                    right?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYes, Sir. That is still right.‚Äù He was very strong and
                    consistent on it. Indeed he really had to face down some of the Senators on this
                    issue a couple of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that the UN, I have talked to people
                        who were in Katanga at the time who felt that the UN was not very strong.
                        There were Indian troops there, but they sort of didn't want to use them.
                        There was considerable provocation. Finally, the Indians went ahead and sort
                        of took care of the Tshombe problem without really UN support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I think they did take the matter into their own hands to some
                    extent. It was very strong, a small force, less than 5,000, but well led. They
                    were Indian Gurkhas who knew what they were doing. But they were also very good
                    at knowing that they were soldiers without enemies; this wasn't a normal kind of
                    campaign. I spent a little time with them myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Jack Dean and Lou Hoffacker and Terry
                        McNamara who were there at the time. They had great admiration for the
                        Indian troops, and felt that the United Nations high command, which, of
                        course, had been played out again and again and really had too many masters
                        and was unable to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was responsible to the Security Council. But the man in
                    charge of the operation at the UN was Ralph Bunche. He was, I thought, very good
                    and very tough, but also very careful politically. We were having a lot of
                    difficulty with the Belgians because the Belgians were responsive to the
                    pressure from the Arminiere Company and rather thought it was just as well for
                    Katanga to be a separate country. Then they could deal with it. They didn't want
                    to preserve the Congo, but the purpose of the UN was to preserve the Congo as a
                    country. It didn't result in it being well governed because Mobutu, who wound up
                    in charge, turned out to be...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Kasavubu and Mobutu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: But in any case, I was very much involved in that in the early period.
                    In fact, it was one crisis after another the whole time I was there in that job.
                    I claimed afterward that I had 100% success in being involved in every piece of
                    a security crisis the U.S. had during that time. Because, you see, mostly there
                    would be a UN aid of some sort. Even when there wasn't, as in Berlin, our
                    gladiator Adlai Stevenson, was a member of the Security Council and a member of
                    the cabinet. He would come down, and each time he would come down, he would
                    expect me to serve him up with facts and ideas to go on. That gave me a license
                    to intervene in the internal affairs of some of the other bureaus, find out what
                    they were doing, and write stuff for Stevenson. It was a great experience for me
                    during that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of in general terms, before we move to the very
                        specific events, what was your impression of how Kennedy and his cabinet
                        dealt with Stevenson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, the White House, it was only Stevenson and Kennedy, the basic
                    relationship. Stevenson, of course, was dealing out of a peculiar position. Here
                    was this man who was about of an age to be his son as president. He was very
                    loyal to him, but he also chafed some. Every two or three weeks, someone would
                    come in and say, ‚ÄúWell, I was at dinner with him last night. He was talking
                    about resigning.‚Äù I told George Ball a couple of times about that. George said,
                    ‚ÄúDon't worry. He'll grumble, but he won't resign.‚Äù He was right, he didn't ever
                    resign.</p>
                <p>He was an enormous asset to the Kennedy administration. If he had defected, the
                    whole left wing of the party would have crumbled as it were, all the liberals.
                    So, it was very important to keep him on board.</p>
                <p>Whenever Jackie Kennedy went to New York, she'd be squired around by him with all
                    the media attention that would require. The President came up and gave a talk at
                    the UN in his first year and also in his third year. He was very anxious to keep
                    Adlai happy.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>He even assigned Arthur Schlesinger a special mission to be sure that he was
                    happy, which created what might have been a crisis if Arthur and I hadn't been
                    able to work it out. For a couple of weeks there after that assignment, Arthur
                    thought that meant that he was supposed to do the IO job too. We were then
                    talking about a two-China policy, about Taiwan. I went over to see Arthur one
                    day in the White House. I said, ‚ÄúArthur, we can have a two-China policy, but we
                    can't have a two-IO policy, okay.‚Äù He laughed and agreed and we actually worked
                    very well together. It was also part of my job to make sure that both that he
                    didn't get off the reservation, but that we didn't get off the reservation with
                    him. Fortunately, Dean Rusk had had the IO job back before it was IO, when it
                    was UNA, UN Affairs, back a long time before in the Truman administration. So
                    technically and professionally, he was very much interested in UN affairs. I had
                    very good access to the Secretary and also to George Ball and Chet Bowles while
                    he was still there. Both Dean Rusk and Adlai Stevenson apparently had enough
                    confidence in me so that I was able to sort of manage this triangular
                    relationship between the White House and Adlai and Dean Rusk. I felt like I was
                    sort of managing it from below like a juggler. When something happened that
                    required a decision to give a task to Adlai that required dealing with the
                    Russians, such as during the Bay of Pigs after the crisis was supposedly over,
                    we still had the big job of negotiating with the Russians about getting those
                    missiles out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are not talking about the Bay of Pigs, we are talking
                        about the missile crisis. Bay of Pigs was the CIA sponsored invasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. We had a problem about that too, partly because Adlai was not
                    sufficiently briefed. I was at the briefing that the CIA gave him, and it was
                    very inadequate. We didn't get any idea of the timing or the purpose even. So he
                    felt very much out on a limb. There was a famous incident at the time you may
                    remember. Just before the invasion, a day or two before, a plane with Cuban
                    markings flew out of Cuban airspace and crash-landed in a swamp in Florida. The
                    pilot said he was defecting, only it turned out it was a CIA plant. But we
                    didn't know that at the time. It was my job to find out what this was about
                    because on that very day, a previous Cuban item accusing us of wanting to invade
                    them was up for debate on the floor of the General Assembly. So Adlai Stevenson
                    was there defending us. I had to find out in a hurry about this incident. So I
                    asked the Latin American bureau to find out from the CIA. What we got back was
                    the cover story which I provided to Stevenson and he orated in the General
                    Assembly as the U.S. view. Within 24 hours some enterprising newspaperman had
                    gone and visited the plane in the swamp and scratched the paint, and found there
                    were U.S. Air Force markings underneath. The whole cover blew off, and Adlai was
                    absolutely fit to be tied. It was really a very unpleasant situation. The
                    obvious thing for him to do was to blame me since I provided the instructions.
                    He never did blame me. He knew that we were both duped by the CIA on that thing,
                    and he really just blamed the administration in general and the President. He
                    was surprisingly polite about it considering how fuming he was in private. It
                    passed over, but it left a kind of a permanent sore, I think.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we go to the Bay of Pigs problem, when you
                        took over there, early '61, was there sort of a virulent anti-UN cadre, say
                        within the Senate or the House, many right wing Republicans? Certainly it
                        became more pronounced later on, but had that started yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There was always a theme in the far right literature, and there were a
                    few people who were influenced by that in the Senate, but in general the feeling
                    about the UN and our actions in the UN, was very positive. I did a lot of
                    speaking around the country during that time, and I was always amazed at how
                    little substantive criticism there was and how much support there was. There has
                    always been very good support for the UN. During the five years I handled the
                    congressional presentations, both on the money for dues and the money for
                    voluntary contributions, like to UNICEF and so forth, we never lost a dime. The
                    people in the Congress correctly believed that the dues was a treaty obligation
                    which they were and are. We beat on the Russians for withholding some of their
                    dues as a pressure point to try to change the Congo policy of the UN. We said
                    that was illegal and they couldn't do that, and so on. But they got away with it
                    because there was no way to lower the boom on them really. We tried to use
                    Article 19, which says you don't pay for two years, you lose your vote. We
                    incorrectly believed that any legislature would hold on to its own prerogatives,
                    but this was a legislature of national sovereigns and didn't act that way. So
                    the general atmosphere was one of very good support for the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the Soviet posture during the time
                        you were there? Was it basically trying to impede the United Nations and
                        make it difficult for us or did it have a policy beyond that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: They felt, correctly, that the UN was an obstacle in their path, and
                    they tried in every way to weaken it, and so on. They couldn't do very much in
                    the Security Council because we had the veto. Of course we couldn't do very much
                    in the Security Council either, because they did. We were able to get around it
                    on some issues like the Congo, like the continuation of the Korean conflict
                    which they couldn't turn off because we had the veto. They, as you know, had
                    been out of the room. They had been boycotting it at the time, so they didn't
                    get a chance to use their veto when they could have. I developed sort of an
                    unusual view about the veto. What the veto did was to convert the Security
                    Council into a consensus instrument. You couldn't do anything unless you really
                    talked it out, and it required us to talk at length with the Russians and the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>In the process we learned quite a lot about what they needed. Sometimes we were
                    able to accommodate a little bit and they were able to accommodate us. We worked
                    very closely with the Secretary Generals, first with Dag HammarskjÔøΩld and then,
                    when he was killed in an air crash, with U Thant. Sometimes we were torpedoed by
                    our own government, a little bit. I can tell you some stories about that, but on
                    the whole we had a very close relationship. So much so that the request to
                    Khrushchev to turn his boats around, and not challenge the picket fence, was
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is during the '62 missile crisis in Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: In the missile crisis, what they were really answering there was a
                    message from U Thant that we had developed which went to both Khrushchev and
                    Kennedy. We were able to work effectively with the Secretary General and the
                    people in his office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will get to particulars, but I was wondering, did you
                        have a problem of trying to, this is a loaded term but, ‚Äúcurb the arrogance‚Äù
                        of the bureaus? You know, going out and saying, ‚ÄúWe want such and such a
                        vote and you tell these small little republics and whatever they are to vote
                        a certain way.‚Äù I'm always getting stories of people who were out in the
                        field saying, ‚ÄúWe get this shopping list and somebody was told to get Iraq
                        to support us in Israel,‚Äù you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, yes. Because the bureaus were organized regionally, they
                    developed their own mystique about what ought to be done at the UN. I was often
                    in a position of having to mediate between bureaus. At one point Dean Rusk said,
                    ‚ÄúI want you to work this out. I want you to act for this purpose as if you were
                    the deputy under secretary over these two bureaus, but if anybody says that,
                    I'll deny it.‚Äù Of course we had the great advantage of first of all we were the
                    action officers on all this kind of stuff, and secondly we had this powerful,
                    personable gladiator in New York that nobody could ignore. We said, ‚ÄúWell, Adlai
                    won't do that.‚Äù They didn't have anybody to tell Adlai to do it except the
                    President and he wasn't about to on any small thing and even on big things. In
                    that sense from a professional point of view it was an extremely interesting job
                    because it got me mixed up with a lot of general foreign policy issues, simply
                    because we had some piece of the action in the UN and we needed to act on it
                    before tomorrow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything depends on the period, and we are talking about
                        the '61-'65 period. How about getting the best officers to sign up for UN
                        affairs as opposed to regional bureau? Was there a problem? How did you find
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I did not find that to be a problem. That was partly because we
                    were creating quite a lot of excitement, and obviously having a good time. I
                    think that was attractive to the kind of people we wanted, the feistier
                    officers. We tried to participate in the effort they turned on early in the
                    administration, to get more African Americans into the Foreign Service. We were
                    able to attract a man who later wound up as ambassador to the UN, Don McHenry.
                    He was a very junior officer when he started. We had him working on trust
                    territories, and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, wasn't this one of the bureaus which was more open
                        to women? I would gather there were some very bright women who sort of
                        specialized in the United Nations affairs because this is one place where
                        they wouldn't be mothered by the old boy network. Is that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I think that's true. Of course, there weren't all that many
                    women in the Foreign Service, so we didn't have a big opportunity of choice
                    there. I think it is fair to say that we were a center of and we were creating a
                    good deal of excitement and interest.</p>
                <p>Joe Sisco became my deputy and my successor later, and later was Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs. He had an unusual career in that his whole career had
                    been in the UN, and he had never been out as ambassador anywhere, yet he became
                    Assistant Secretary and then Under Secretary. But, he was an operational kind of
                    a guy. When we moved him out of political section of our bureau and made him a
                    deputy, his natural successor was Bill Buffum, who was also very bright, very
                    operational, and later became the top American in the UN secretariat, the job
                    Ralph Bunche had first had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard that Joe Sisco, there have been a lot of
                        stories in my interviews involving him, how he knew how to play Washington
                        and the bureaucratic game almost better than anybody my interviewees had
                        ever run across.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think that's right. More than that even, he was interested and good
                    at the tactical game in the UN, the rounding up of a particular commissioner or
                    stalling something because we didn't have the support, or rushing it because we
                    did, all that kind of thing. On important issues, we had a line that came
                    directly into our office where we heard the debate as it was going on. We could
                    intervene in it by calling people in our delegation up there in real time. We
                    also went up to New York a good deal and he was active in that aspect of the
                    business. My other deputy during most of the time I was there was Dick Gardner
                    who was a young sort of lawyer economist, who had done his thesis about Breton
                    Woods institutions and sterling-dollar diplomacy, and was very much interested
                    in all of the economic and scientific agencies, and so on. There was a good
                    division of labor between them actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bay of Pigs came. It had really been set up during the
                        Eisenhower administration, this is the attempted invasion of Cuba by the
                        CIA. How did that hit you? I mean were you briefed very well on this because
                        it ended up in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was in the UN right along. It was as I said before, we had
                    this incident about this defector who turned out to be not a defector. We had a
                    briefing by William Tracy, I can't remember if that were his first and last
                    name. I went up to it in New York. It was not very forthcoming or helpful, and I
                    watched the thing come apart. I had a ringside seat by accident in the cabinet
                    room because the Cuba item was on the floor of the General Assembly during that
                    week. So the whole thing was roiling and boiling in the media, but it was also
                    roiling and boiling on the floor of the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>It was very important that what was said from the White House about the Bay of
                    Pigs and what Adlai was saying for the United States sounded like the same
                    government. It was my job to keep it stitched together. So I watched that. It
                    came apart very fast, over two days. The President was very impressive. Thinking
                    about it afterwards I thought here was a guy whose last executive job was head
                    of a PT boat. So he wasn't really used to being an executive. For example, he
                    never really asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff whether they thought the military
                    thing would work.</p>
                <p>The plan had been cooked up in the CIA by a unit of the CIA run by an economist,
                    Dick Bissell. I had worked for Dick Bissell; I was Dick Bissell's deputy in the
                    Marshall Plan, but I didn't see very much of him even though he was there in the
                    room some of the time. I have several vivid memories of that cabinet room those
                    two days. At one point, there was a discussion about how close to the shore the
                    naval units should be. People were arguing that maybe they ought to be over the
                    horizon where they couldn't be seen. At one point the President gets up and goes
                    around this long table to this big magnetic display thing where they had all
                    these ships stuck to it, and he picks up one of the naval ships and moves it
                    back so that it would be over the horizon from the shore. I just happened to
                    look at that moment at Admiral Burke's face, Admiral Arleigh Burke. He was chief
                    of naval operations and I think was probably the acting chief at that point,
                    acting chairman that day at least in the room. He had this stricken look on his
                    face. You could almost read his mind saying ‚ÄúGod is this the former naval
                    officer, a Lieutenant JG, micromanaging the Navy?‚Äù I can't live with this
                    feeling. So I would say that Kennedy hadn't quite known how to be the executive
                    who was in charge of that operation. He didn't know that an executive executes
                    by asking questions mostly. He didn't ask enough questions. His learning curve
                    was very steep.</p>
                <p>By the Cuban missile crisis he was doing just that. He was participating
                    personally in the staff work. That's why that came out better, I think. Also I
                    was impressed with the fact that as soon as it was clear that it was a boo-boo,
                    he goes out into the press room personally, and says it was a boo-boo, and ‚ÄúI am
                    responsible for it totally.‚Äù Just think if Nixon had done that the day after the
                    Watergate burglary. It would have been different.</p>

                        the war in Yugoslavia, and you can just see that everybody is trying to
                        cover their behind or cover their chief's behinds rather than figuring out

                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. Basically it was a public relations mess. It was only a big thing
                    in the UN because the Cubans, of course, were in there making their case which
                    was pretty good. We were trying to invade them, they thought. Theoretically we
                    weren't; it was just that our guys were helping their guys get over there, and
                    so forth. But in the end, we didn't follow up with air power or naval power. It
                    was just an embarrassing failure; and especially embarrassing for Adlai who had
                    to be the gladiator out front.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The Congo had just become independent from Belgium the year before.
                    The Russians and Chinese and others were moving in to see what advantage they
                    could take. The country was split between factions, one in the north around
                    Stanleyville as it was called, headed by Patrice Lumumba. One in the center
                    which was the national government headed in this period by a fellow named
                    Abdullah. One on the south which was the mining area, Katanga, where Belgian
                    mining interests were still very much involved and where a fellow named
                    Tshombe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moise Tshombe in Elizabethville.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: In Elizabethville. So rather early on the UN with U.S. support decided
                    we have got to try to keep the country together and put in a peace keeping force
                    to calm down the rioting, and so on. Ralph Bunche went there several times. He
                    was kind of in charge for the UN in operations. When Kennedy came in it was
                    already set. The first things I did had to do with coordinating the reaction to
                    the Congo because it involved two different geographic regions, Europe and
                    Africa. It also involved a sizable military operation under the UN in which we
                    were contributing not forces but most of the logistical support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Belgians? Were they giving us trouble in the
                        UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, not in the UN so much. Some Belgians, not really the government,
                    the mining interests, were supporting Tshombe financially. He had raised a
                    gendarmerie called the Katanga police. They had a sizable force there. A good
                    part of the first part of that year was taken up with UN forces chasing the
                    Katanga gendarmerie around. We had to handle it in the Security Council. Most of
                    the Security Council had decided during the Eisenhower administration there was
                    no way anybody could get it turned off unless we agreed. We didn't want it
                    turned off. The president got very clear in his mind during one of our first
                    briefings that if the UN was not there, and its presence was obviously
                    buffaloing the Russians and also the Chinese were pushing in there, that if the
                    UN wasn't there, we'd have to be there with some force ourselves. I know that
                    each time we had a meeting in the oval office about that, about the Congo, he
                    would turn to me and say, ‚ÄúI remember, Harlan, you said if they weren't in
                    there, we'd have to be in there ourselves. Is that still right?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYes,
                    that is still right.‚Äù It was a consistent threat despite the fact that we had
                    some vigorous opposition from the House particularly led by Thomas Dodd, the
                    father of the present senator, who seemed to be very much on the side of the
                    Belgian mining interests. Anyway, we did support the government there. I went
                    over and developed the first economic aid program for the Congo during the year
                    and did a lot on the Hill about supplying the Congo, so it was a big thing in my
                    life that year. The thing I remember about it particularly was the first meeting
                    on that subject that I convened contained four former governors of American
                    states: Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Averell Harriman of New York, Chester
                    Bowles of Connecticut, and ‚ÄúSoapy‚Äù Mennen Williams of Michigan. I felt a little
                    bit out of my class. I was a much younger person than any of them, but I was in
                    a position where I had to coordinate things, so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the crucial decisions of this early time was
                        getting the Irish and Swedish troops, who were terribly ineffective, out of
                        Katanga and putting in a solid Indian brigade, I guess it was. Where was
                        that decision made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That was mostly in process before we arrived on the scene. During that
                    first year, 1961, I formulated a principle of peacemaking which was if you want
                    to make peace, get peacemakers from as far away as possible. The only troops
                    that were kind of making local politics, and not being very helpful, were the
                    Ghanaians. Otherwise, we had troops from India, Malaysia, and I believe Finland
                    and Canada. So the problem about the Swedes and the Irish was before my
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure, but they were, well some Irish got eaten as
                        a matter of fact. They just weren't, the Irish had never really fought, and
                        they just weren't trained to deal with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think of the Irish as being tough fighters.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they might have been, but I mean there was still a
                        matter of leadership, and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: The leadership of the Indian Gurkhas was really magnificent. I spent a
                    little time with the brigadier who was in charge of that brigade. He explained
                    to me that they really had to understand that they were soldiers without enemies
                    and that even if provoked, they should be careful not to storm right away. There
                    was one incident I watched very closely of these Indian troops being attacked by
                    a group of women throwing things at them. They just stood there and didn't even
                    shoot into the air. That was real leadership. I wrote about that in a book
                    called The Allegations of Power in the middle of that decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we have got a man who is a young vice consul
                        named Terry McNamara who was in Elizabethville at the time. He talks about
                        this. What about other parts of, you were doing international organizations
                        at a time when the pace of decolonization was picking up and you were
                        getting a lot of new countries coming in to the United Nations. Was this
                        causing us any disquiet about wondering where they are going to be as far as
                        East-West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, quite a number of the countries had already become independent:
                    India and Indonesia. The whole Indian sub-continent had been shortly after World
                    War II. The main problem that bothered us as a policy matter was the splintering
                    off of smaller and smaller states. We were beginning to get island states like
                    Pitcairn Island and Noumea, and so forth, wanting to be sovereign states with a
                    few hundred thousand people or less. The way the UN was set up with one country,
                    one vote, it was beginning to look grotesque. So the idea of a Security Council
                    with a limited number of countries was a pretty good idea, even though some of
                    us had been worried about the veto before. Then in April, we did have the Bay of
                    Pigs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel that the IO was on the Bay of Pigs? Had
                        you been prepared for this or did it just come?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, Cuba had been an issue in the UN. All along the Cubans kept
                    charging we were about to invade them. It turned out to be a reasonable thing
                    for them to think. At that time in American foreign policy, there was hardly any
                    issue anywhere in the world that wasn't also a UN problem. I think I said to you
                    before that I think I had a perfect record for those 4 ÔøΩ years, almost five
                    years in that job, of being personally involved in every peace and security
                    crisis that came along. That was even true of matters that were deliberately
                    being excluded from the UN like Berlin, which was a great power issue because
                    our gladiator at the UN, Adlai Stevenson, was also a member of the Cabinet and
                    the National Security Council. He had to be consulted on anything important, and
                    expected me and our bureau to do the Washington staff work for him on anything
                    he could get. He didn't involve himself with the other regional bureaus too
                    much. He'd talk to us, and we'd get the information from the bureau. So, in the
                    case of the Bay of Pigs, it came on rather rapidly because there was a Cuba item
                    on the General Assembly agenda, a Cuban charge that we were thinking about
                    invading them. Actually the Bay of Pigs happened to be the same week that item
                    came up on the General Assembly agenda. I don't know whether anybody at the CIA
                    knew that ahead of time. They probably weren't noticing the General Assembly
                    agenda, but that was the very thing. Then we had an incident, did we discuss
                    this before?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think some of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: A Cuban air force plane flew out of Cuban airspace and over to Florida
                    and crash landed in Florida. That was a big event because it looked as if the
                    Cuban armed forces were maybe falling apart or defecting, and so on. That day,
                    Adlai Stevenson had to be on the floor of the General Assembly on the Cuba item.
                    So we had to know what the story was. I asked our Latin American people, and
                    they tried to find out from the CIA how things stood and what we got back was
                    the cover story. A Cuban plane had come out and defected and so on. Within 24
                    hours an enterprising journalist had found out where the plane had landed in the
                    swamp. He scraped away at the Cuban markings and found there were U.S. Air Force
                    markings underneath. So the cover blew off very fast, and Adlai Stevenson was
                    fit to be tied because his great credibility had been put at risk unnecessarily
                    before the world. He was very good about it. The easiest thing in the world
                    would be to blame me because I had given him the instructions, but he didn't.
                    The CIA had come up to brief him, to New York. I went up with them, just a few
                    days before, to tell him the Bay of Pigs invasion was happening. It was a very
                    faulty briefing, not very candid. I don't know whether it was to deliberately
                    keep the information from Stevenson for fear it would leak, or whether like
                    other aspects of that operation not very well managed. In any case, we were kind
                    of leery of the operation, and worried about having to defend it in the UN.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I spent two fascinating days in the cabinet room of the White House as it came
                    apart. It was terribly important that the White House press officer, Pierre
                    Salinger, go out every hour and say something, and there was a demand for
                    something to be said. At the same time, Adlai Stevenson was in New York. Being
                    with the same government, it was important that they be saying more or less the
                    same thing at the same time. My job was to sort of make sure that that worked
                    out. I watched that operation very closely as it came apart.</p>
                <p>A few vignettes remain a vivid memory. One of them was when President Kennedy got
                    up and walked around the cabinet room. At the head of the table there was a big
                    map showing the environs of Cuba and showing where the naval forces were
                    deployed. They used little metal replicas of the ships which would stick to this
                    magnetic board. He picked up one of the destroyers that seemed rather close to
                    shore and put it back over the horizon. I just happened to look at that moment
                    at Admiral Burke, Arleigh Burke, who was the senior officer present in the navy
                    and was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that day. I could just see,
                    could read on his face what he was thinking. He was a U.S. navy man, being
                    commanded by this former lieutenant JG. What on earth are we in for here? A look
                    of desperation on his face. It was a trying time for all the people in the room
                    who were involved in the operation itself when they realized it just wasn't
                    working. Some of them hoped that Kennedy would be willing to up the ante by
                    using air cover or moving the navy in closer or somehow defending the disaster
                    on the ground. Kennedy was very clear that they were already in too deep, and it
                    would be a mistake to start a really big conflagration. Kennedy at that time had
                    been president for only three months. His last executive job before that, some
                    years before had been to run a PT boat. That was the last executive job he had
                    before being president. I think he wasn't really accustomed to thinking like an
                    executive. An executive mostly executes by asking questions. He never really
                    asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff what they thought from a military point of view
                    about this military operation that had been cooked up in the CIA in a unit
                    headed by an economist. So it came to pieces, and as it came to pieces Bobby
                    Kennedy sitting at the end of the table was sort of glowering around at
                    everybody saying something to the effect that I don't want to hear anybody
                    saying they didn't think this was a good idea. When it was clear that it wasn't
                    working, that it was going to be a failure, it was the President who decided to
                    go out personally and meet the press and say there had been a mistake and we
                    just have to go on from there. I often thought later that if Nixon had said that
                    about the Watergate burglary, history might be different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. What about again dealing back to Cuba, the
                        Cuban missile crisis? This must have put quite a strain on your office.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: We were very much involved in that, too. I was called out of a dinner
                    at the Swiss embassy. My call from Secretary Rusk asking me to come over before
                    going home to come over to the office. I had an inkling there was something
                    going on. There were a lot of rumors, but it wasn't clear what was going on. I
                    asked him whether he wanted me to increase the rumor factor by having me get up
                    suddenly and leave in the middle of an embassy dinner. He said, ‚ÄúNo, you had
                    better wait, have some coffee and then go.‚Äù So I did that, and a whole second
                    tier of officials were brought in to the secret meeting, to see photographs that
                    had been taken by the U-2 of the missiles in Cuba which led then to the
                    president's decision after awhile to blockade Cuba and threaten but not actually
                    bomb the missiles. There were advocates of bombing the missiles right away.
                    After some argument the President rightly came to the conclusion that to start
                    things off by killing some Soviet citizens at an air base in Cuba would not
                    probably be the way to handle it. So we came to this rather sophisticated
                    decision.</p>
                <p>Our part in it was by doing staff work for Adlai Stevenson as a central member of
                    the little group that was gathering in the cabinet room every day. And then to
                    come in and out from New York. The scenario that we developed was first to go to
                    the western hemisphere, the Organization of American States, and get unanimous
                    consent from the hemisphere that this was a bad thing to be doing, a Monroe
                    Doctrine kind of ploy. And only then to go to the Security Council. So while the
                    President was speaking on Monday night telling the world about the missiles, not
                    using the pictures, the CIA was still trying to sit on the pictures because they
                    were afraid of the consequences of the Russians learning how good the resolution
                    of our cameras was.</p>
                <p>He made his dramatic nationwide, worldwide speech. While that speech was going
                    on, we deposited at the Organization of American States, a request for an
                    immediate meeting which started the next morning. There was a request for an
                    immediate meeting of the Security Council which we didn't want because we wanted
                    to do the western hemisphere thing first. We thought that could be done in the
                    morning, and Secretary Rusk handled that personally. But a number of countries
                    had to go for instructions to their foreign ministers. That process would be
                    finished by the end of the morning. So we scattered for lunch, and the Latin
                    American lunch is somewhat longer than lunches in some other parts of the world.
                    It was actually close to 4:00 before they reconvened.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the president of the Security council, who ironically was the Soviet
                    representative that month, called the Security Council to order at 4:00. I was
                    listening to the television in my office to the debate going on which started
                    with Adlai making a speech mostly written by my assistant, Don Wilson, and
                    Arthur Schlesinger, who had come over to my office. He had been working on this
                    over the weekend. It was a long speech. It took nearly an hour. I was concerned
                    that we wouldn't get word from the Organization of American States before the
                    speech was ended. The key passage in the speech was supposed to be that we were
                    doing this as a representative of our hemisphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>So about five minutes before the end of the speech, I was following the text so I
                    knew where I was, a call came in and my secretary came rushing in saying
                    Secretary Rusk is on the phone with Ed Martin who is Assistant Secretary for
                    Latin American Affairs. They told me to go ahead and authorize that he can say
                    this is the whole hemisphere. Only Uruguay had not been able to respond. They
                    had nine co-presidents at that time and they couldn't give a rapid decision. So
                    I called a number, a phone just outside the Security Council where we had
                    stationed a young woman from our mission to make sure nobody else used it so we
                    could always use it for such an emergency. I asked her to get Joe Sisco, my
                    deputy who was sitting right behind Stevenson. I could see him on television,
                    come off, and take the call himself. We were assembled in the office, a number
                    of staff members. We saw Joe Sisco get up and leave the screen and take my call.
                    I dictated to him a short paragraph that said this was a hemisphere action and
                    that we were declaring a blockade. We didn't want to call it a blockade so we
                    called it a quarantine. I saw Sisco come back and put a paper down in front of
                    Stevenson. Adlai was in full rhetorical flame. He was sitting down, but he had
                    the manuscript folded up in front of him. It looked to me as if he hadn't been
                    able to see this insert. At that point, the President is on the phone
                    personally. So I picked up the phone and he asked did you hear about the OAS
                    action? Is there some way we can get it into the speech before he finishes? I
                    wonder what I would have said if we hadn't thought to cover that. So, I said,
                    ‚ÄúYes we have just put an insert in front of him, but I don't know if...‚Äù at that
                    moment on the screen I see Stevenson notice the insert, pick it up, and before I
                    had a chance to say anything more, the President, who was obviously watching the
                    same TV show, said, ‚ÄúOh, I see, he is picking it up and reading it now.‚Äù Bang!
                    So as I said later, the Cuban missile crisis wasn't over, but mine was. That was
                    a good example of the kind of central position in the scheme of things that the
                    IO bureau occupied in that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in the Middle East, Israel,
                        the Arab states?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, because that was often coming up in a UN context either an
                    anti-Israel resolution on the floor of the assembly or reauthorizations of the
                    UN emergency force in the Middle East, which was still operating in the Sinai
                    and operated for years and years in the Sinai desert. It was building up to what
                    became a '67 war. So, there was constant argument and debate about it in the UN
                    context, mostly though in the General Assembly, not in the Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Secretary General during most of this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, Dag HammarskjÔøΩld was when we first came in. I got to know him
                    quite well, actually after three months. Then he went on an inspection mission
                    to the Congo, and his plane crashed and he was killed. So, we had to
                    subsequently deal with the problem of the selection of a new Secretary General.
                    That was another dramatic period in my life. It was just at the beginning of the
                    General Assembly session itself in the fall of '61. I was up consulting with the
                    mission about various things we were supposed to do. We had already had a caucus
                    with the President and Arthur Schlesinger and myself on the ‚ÄúHoney Fitz‚Äù which
                    was his motorboat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A cabin cruiser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, not very big actually. A small fishing boat really. I remember
                    Jackie Kennedy pouring Bloody Marys for us in her bikini. We had laid out the
                    kind of program and he had made the opening speech at the assembly, I believe,
                    already by that time. Then Dag HammarskjÔøΩld was killed, and we had to deal with
                    that, so I spent several days in New York helping to think about who we should
                    come out for, and how to handle it, consulting with other delegations and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>We finally decided that it was going to be Asia's turn in the job, and U Thant
                    would probably be a good bet, although he was not anything like the direct
                    action personality that Dag HammarskjÔøΩld was. We later had some difficulty with
                    Secretary General U Thant, most of which was not his fault but ours, i.e.,
                    Stevenson learning things from him that he didn't pass on to the government, and
                    U Thant thinking he was talking to the government.</p>
                <p>When it came to the Cuban missile crisis, for example, we provided U Thant with a
                    letter to be sent to both Khrushchev and Kennedy asking both to cool it and not
                    have a confrontation. It was actually that letter which Khrushchev was acting on
                    when he decided to turn his ships around and not challenge the blockade. Then,
                    after that, there was a long period during which Jack McCloy was rehired into
                    the administration, a former assistant secretary of war, to handle the
                    negotiations with the deputy foreign minister of Russia who was a man named
                    Kuznetsov. That whole negotiation took place under cover of the UN, via the our
                    mission to the United Nations to which McCloy was attached. The White House
                    staff didn't want Stevenson to handle that job because they didn't think he'd be
                    tough enough. I think they were wrong about that, but I didn't get a vote on
                    that subject. But the thing was done as a mission thing, and therefore the first
                    action office in Washington was my office in handling all the reports from
                    McCloy and the instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Stevenson make it known that he wasn't too happy about
                        being bypassed by McCloy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, it was sort of a chronic problem, particularly with Robert
                    Kennedy, the Attorney General and some of the White House staff people who
                    wanted very much to keep Stevenson in the Kennedy administration, which was
                    essential politically because his defection from the administration would have
                    lost Kennedy sort of the left wing of the party. People were still being called
                    in those days, liberals and conservatives. So it was a chronic issue of that
                    sort. On the other hand Kennedy personally tried very hard to keep good
                    relations, from Jackie Kennedy going off to New York to be squired around by
                    Stevenson, with all the publicity that involved, so the relationship remained
                    viable. It was never easy, partly because Stevenson, who was a man old enough to
                    be his son, saw Kennedy sitting in job that he had twice run for himself, so it
                    was not an easy position psychologically for him or Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the transition come? Did you see a change when
                        Kennedy was assassinated in November of '63 and Johnson came in? As far as
                        you were concerned, was there a different look at the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It didn't really affect UN policy so much. I'd say practically not at
                    all. President Johnson's policy was let's have continuity at all costs. He asked
                    everybody to remain in office. At first his intention was to not have any of us
                    resign which would have been the normal thing. With a new president, everybody
                    resigns, and then those he wants, he can ask back. Dean Rusk had a group of us
                    in his office one day and said this is what the President is thinking about.
                    Several of us strongly took the position that he should ask every one of us to
                    resign. He shouldn't set a precedent that some future President wouldn't want to
                    live with. Anyway, we did resign but he told us all to stay on the job.</p>
                <p>Stevenson's reaction was interesting. His first reaction was, well, this is a man
                    of my generation. I have known him for a long time. I can do well by him and get
                    along with him. I think he really thought that this could be a much easier
                    relationship. LBJ operated that way for the first few weeks. He had Stevenson
                    come down to the ranch, all that sort of thing. But, that didn't last very long.
                    I think to LBJ, Stevenson was too much of a liberal, and that wasn't his style,
                    although interestingly, the positions that the President took on domestic
                    affairs were bolder and certainly more effective with Congress than Kennedy's
                    had been on civil rights, for example. The great Civil Rights Act of 1965 was in
                    a way prepared by the Kennedy administration but it was really LBJ who got it
                    through. He was a master at legislative tactics. I had learned that while he was
                    Vice President about a UN bond issue we were trying to get through to help
                    finance the peace keeping function, when the Soviets, by turning off their
                    contributions, made it difficult to meet those bills. I had a chance to watch as
                    Vice President Johnson called in his assistant, Bobby Baker, later famous for
                    other things, and they went over one of those sheets with all the Senator's
                    names on it. He discussed each Senator and what he would be most influenced by,
                    and so on. So, on legislative strategy, he was somebody that really knew what he
                    was doing, and did it well.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>He was not ever comfortable with foreign policy issues I would say. In that
                    sense, Stevenson had the advantage in not only that he knew a lot about it, but
                    he knew everybody, all the leaders in the world. Johnson tried to shore up his
                    personal connections by having a big reception in the State Department at the
                    time of Kennedy's funeral when all the heads of state, De Gaulle and everybody
                    else, were over. He talked second-hand with most of the world's leaders at that
                    time. Stevenson and Ralph Bunche were very helpful during that time, and to some
                    extent also in making those connections for the new White House, the President
                    and the new White House staff. It was not entirely new though. Mac Bundy stayed
                    on for awhile. Most of the people he brought in and the Kennedy people drifted
                    off before too long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the IO organization, did you sense concern with the
                        departure, the death of Kennedy and the coming on of Johnson, about where we
                        were going and all that, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Not really as a matter of policy, no. The President was being advised
                    by people who knew what we were doing, agreed with it. I think he had the same
                    feeling about Stevenson, that it was very important to keep him on board, so
                    that was a continuity. He was preoccupied in his first year and a half or so
                    with domestic policy anyway. He was running for reelection to begin with. Then
                    there was the big civil rights and other legislation in the first year of his
                    elected term. So he did all the things he needed to do. He saw the statesmen
                    from around the world as they came in and out of Washington, and was well
                    briefed and knew what he was talking about. That wasn't the center of his
                    interest at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the civil rights movement? I would have thought
                        that this would have been something the Soviets, in our dealing with the
                        African-Americans in the United States was pretty awful, particularly for a
                        country that declares itself to be the great democracy. Did you find
                        yourself getting beaten up a lot on this thing? Were you really engaged in
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, we had a lot of defending to do, and putting incidents like the
                    Selma civil rights demonstrations and their suppression, putting them in the
                    perspective of what was a long period of progress. The civil rights legislation
                    in '65 helped a lot in that respect. We were trying very hard to get the UN to
                    set up a High Commissioner of Human Rights that would have some vigorous
                    functions and some teeth in it, as we have now with Mary Robinson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She is very busy, as we speak, working on the problem in
                        Kosovo.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Exactly. We wanted very much to get that set up. We had a lot of
                    trouble with that on the Hill because of some of those southern senators
                    particularly. Of course at that time the Democrats were in control of Congress,
                    and control in the Congress was mostly in the hands of southerners. We had to
                    deal with such questions as we don't want a high commissioner that could come in
                    and actually investigate anything in the United States. I kept talking about
                    Selma and the University of Alabama issue; the candle light was already shining
                    on that. CBS and ABC and NBC and public television, all the newspapers and so
                    forth, a UN inspection could hardly increase the amount of candlepower focused
                    on the subject, so we weren't really giving up anything by permitting
                    inspections. So our argument in a way was less with the UN and more with
                    Congress on those issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left in '65. You went through the election time
                        and all. Why did you leave by '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Because I was offered a job. My assumption was that my next large
                    stride in my career would be to succeed Adlai Stevenson in New York as the top
                    ambassador to the UN. Dean Rusk had told me that was how he hoped to work things
                    out eventually, whenever Stevenson had decided he had had enough.</p>
                <p>Stevenson kept talking about resigning. He didn't, but was talking about it. But
                    then Tom Finletter, who had been U.S. ambassador to NATO and had been there for
                    several years, I guess since the beginning of the Kennedy administration,
                    decided that he wanted to leave that job. Both George Ball, who was Deputy
                    Secretary of Defense and Bob McNamara, who was Secretary of Defense, felt that I
                    would be right for the NATO job. Well, because I think McNamara particularly had
                    seen me mostly in my capacity as an analyst of international diplomacy and
                    multilateral diplomacy. That was a multilateral diplomacy job, the best
                    multilateral diplomacy job apart from the UN job.</p>
                <p>So that decision was made, and I was already nominated when Stevenson suddenly
                    died in London. He had a heart attack on the sidewalk in Grosvenor Square. I
                    went through a short period of feeling if I hadn't already signed on to this
                    other job, maybe I would be available. I was very glad it worked out the way it
                    did because to the president, Johnson, the main thing he had to do was get a
                    spectacular appointment as Stevenson's successor because Stevenson was such a
                    well-known figure. He did that by persuading Justice Arthur Goldberg to come off
                    the Supreme Court and take the job in New York.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Goldberg, who had ambitions in New York politics, felt that he could become
                    governor of New York, so he took the deal. I learned later that Goldberg when he
                    was arguing with the President that he really shouldn't come off the Supreme
                    Court and so on, that one of the arguments he'd use was you have somebody right
                    in the administration who could fall into that job and be a natural, namely
                    Harlan Cleveland. But the president had brushed that off and said he had already
                    taken the other job and maybe also he had in mind that he wanted to do something
                    more spectacular than pick up one of the bureaucrats and offer him Stevenson's
                    job. So, I worked very briefly with Arthur Goldberg. Basically the kind of
                    function I had performed with Stevenson was performed with Goldberg by Joe Sisco
                    who had been my deputy and became my successor as Assistant Secretary. Joe then
                    went on to a very illustrious Foreign Service career. He became the Under
                    Secretary of Political Affairs in the State Department, a very unusual career
                    for a Foreign Service officer because he had never been stationed abroad in any
                    job at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many in the Foreign Service used to remark when he would
                        say he is a Foreign Service officer with a relatively high rank, they would,
                        sort of be glowering into their martini glasses, he is not really a Foreign
                        Service officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It would be better had he had a consular job or any of those things
                    you do. He was always a UN tactician for years and years, and very valuable to
                    me in my job. He was mostly the UN expert tactician, and my other deputy, Dick
                    Gardner who was a lawyer and economist, was handling most of the other
                    international organizations and some of the special issues like population
                    policy for the UN, things like that which came up. It was a very good team. Bill
                    Buffum who succeeded Joe Sisco as head of UN political affairs later also became
                    assistant secretary for IO and was put into what I always thought was the Ralph
                    Bunche job at the UN secretariat as the top American to the Secretary General.
                    So, we had a strong team there, and we were dealing with powerful regional
                    bureaus. There were a lot of important issues that wouldn't wait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '65 you went to the NATO job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: So in '65 under rather dramatic circumstances, I went to the NATO job.
                    Once I had been confirmed, then there were plans for the usual laying on of
                    hands which usually took place upstairs in the State Department where our
                    current ambassadors met. De Gaulle had threatened to start at that season the
                    rhetorical barrage about the UN that ended up in the withdrawal of France from
                    the military aspect of NATO. So somebody obviously had to say something in reply
                    to this big ploy of General de Gaulle. The person to say that was obviously the
                    President.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So, my laying on of hands ceremony was suddenly promoted into the rose garden,
                    and I helped draft the speech that the President gave on that occasion. It sort
                    of set our line about being flexible about the French but adamant about our
                    support of the UN, of NATO.</p>
                <p>So when we got to Paris, it wasn't until two years later that we had to move the
                    whole thing to Brussels. That is a story in itself that we'll get to. One of the
                    first things I did in the mandatory calls on all of my colleagues, the other
                    ambassadors to NATO, I called on Pierre DeLouisse, who was an older man, more de
                    Gaulle's generation, had known de Gaulle very well. It was interesting that the
                    French all through this period put at NATO their best foreign service people.
                    The French foreign office was trying hard to make sure they didn't have any
                    Goths in that because de Gaulle felt so strongly about French sovereignty being
                    compromised by their membership in NATO. So, I call on Ambassador Pierre
                    DeLouisse, and had an extraordinary experience. I had no sooner sat down on his
                    sofa when Ambassador DeLouisse, still standing, said, ‚ÄúI hope you are not going
                    to ask me what the old man means.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWell Mister Ambassador, I wouldn't
                    really want to bring negotiations up in this first courtesy call.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúNow
                    look. You and I don't know each other yet, but we are going to have to work very
                    closely together. We can do it two ways. We can sit across the table and glare
                    at each other, or we can sit down on the same side of the table and we can gaze
                    up at the great enigma and try to figure out what the hell he means.‚Äù</p>
                <p>After that, I never could treat him at arms length. He had shown such a human
                    side of himself as a diplomat. He was more than a regular foreign service person
                    because when he left that job, he was appointed by de Gaulle as head of the
                    ORTF, the French radio-television monopoly. So, he had a good in with de Gaulle,
                    and he was also a very popular colleague with both his personal sensitivities
                    and he was also a very bright professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was our reading at that time? I mean, all
                        right, de Gaulle wants us out, so we get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, he hadn't said yet that he wants us to go out. There was a
                    rumbling about it. He didn't actually lower the boom for almost two years. They
                    were being difficult about a lot of issues, especially military issues. It
                    wasn't really part of their policy to object to a North Atlantic Council, they
                    were just objecting to all these military commanders, and so on, being in the
                    environs of Paris, and all the troops. So it wasn't until two years later that
                    he finally said all foreign military will have to get out of France. That meant
                    not only the troops doing various things, communications, aircraft duty and so
                    on, but it also meant the supreme commander of NATO, an American and his whole
                    staff will have to get out. There was then a period of uncertainty. Some of the
                    allies were soft on France, and we were inclined to be, didn't want to offend
                    France by saying the North Atlantic Council had to leave too.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>But as the American representative on the North Atlantic Council, I was clear we
                    were going to have to go. I finally got the State Department at my
                    recommendation, to instruct me to ask one question in the council chamber. In
                    the event of a war in which France remains neutral, how does France propose that
                    we keep closely in touch with our supreme commander who is going to be in
                    Belgium? The French ambassador, who was a very good friend, I had told him ahead
                    of time what I was going to be asking. He looked up at the ceiling for a moment
                    and said, ‚ÄúYou'll never get an answer out of the Quai d'Orsay on a question like
                    that.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI know. That is the idea.‚Äù So, he absorbed the question and
                    reported it to Paris and the military. After about three weeks of no answer, the
                    Danes, the Greeks and others were inclined to be uncertain whether we should
                    move or not. Everybody agreed to move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine there would also be the problem that
                        most just didn't want to move because Paris is Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I think there was some of that sentiment. We really didn't have
                    that feeling. We were looking forward to the chance to see another piece of
                    Europe, in personal terms. In fact our general experience was that we had a more
                    fun time living in Brussels in a sizable house, but a lot smaller than the
                    mansion that we lived in in Paris with a lot fewer servants in Brussels, but it
                    was just a more congenial environment in general. The Belgians were more
                    welcoming. They had us in their homes in a way that didn't happen in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had the political alliance of the North Atlantic
                        Treaty Organization, and then you had the military. You were dealing mainly
                        with the political side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, I was dealing with both. Remember I remarked before the decision
                    was made by McNamara when I was appointed to make me his representative in Paris
                    too. So, I was really reporting both to the Secretary of State and the Secretary
                    of Defense. I had one of my deputies who was a civilian in the McNamara whiz kid
                    think tank in the early part of the Kennedy administration, Jim Stanley. So I
                    did a lot of business with the Defense Department as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '65 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: To '69, almost five months into the Nixon administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Greece and Turkey come into the organization by the
                        time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes indeed. And the Greek and Turkish ambassadors happened to be
                    extremely good friends. You would see them walking down the hall with their arms
                    around each other and so forth. I had already been through one Cyprus crisis
                    when I was in the State Department in the early '60s. In 1967 we had another one
                    where at one point President Johnson had to send Cy Vance, a former Deputy
                    Secretary of Defense, at that point, over to try to make sure that the Turks
                    understood that it was very serious violation of their friendship with us if
                    they should invade Cyprus. I called Washington up one night to ask, ‚ÄúShouldn't
                    we get the Secretary General of NATO involved, get him to go down and make peace
                    between these two allies, make the point that allies can't go to war with each
                    other?‚Äù I had been really pushed into this by the Turkish ambassador who came to
                    me in great alarm saying he thought the invasion would be tomorrow morning if I
                    couldn't do something about it. So I went not as an envoy but as the American
                    representative to the Secretary General. The problem is he had to go without
                    having an invitation from either of the two countries at the time he left. We
                    had an American plane standing by at the airport, a military plane to take him
                    first to Athens and then to Ankara. We were able to announce that evening that
                    the NATO Secretary General was going down, not as another piece of the deterrent
                    in fact. The combination with Vance we thought was the most effective ploy. But
                    the interesting thing was when I called to make that suggestion, the crisis task
                    force was working on Cyprus. I had assumed they had already been considering
                    this, but I can't remember who I was talking to, said that we haven't really
                    discussed that yet, but that is a good idea. I know they were getting quick
                    instructions. It often happens, it does happen I think in diplomacy, the person
                    on the ground can better figure out what his instructions ought to be than
                    anybody else, and shouldn't be bashful about making suggestions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this Cyprus crisis came about to a certain extent
                        because of the colonel's coup in Greece. That was in April of '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, they were becoming more militant about it. But the Turks had made
                    very clear that they were going to take no nonsense. They kept the Turkish
                    military force in the Turkish part of Cyprus. It was clear that if the Greek
                    Cypriots tried to sort of envelop the whole island, that Turkey would get into
                    it. They almost got into it on their own initiative as it turned out, so it was
                    a very dicey, hairy situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, during this time, '65-'69, what was the feeling
                        about the Soviet threat at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was regarded as a maximum threat. They had this huge
                    inventory of nuclear weapons. I suppose at that time there were 10-12,000
                    nuclear weapons in the world; almost all of them ours and theirs, a few in the
                    hands of the British and French and Chinese. Our problem with the non-nuclear
                    allies, particularly Germany, West Germany at that time, Federal Republic, was
                    that their political leaders tended to overstate the probability of a nuclear
                    reaction to anything. You hear politicians say that the first Russian soldier
                    or, East German soldier, who sets his foot across the demarcation line, all hell
                    will break loose.</p>
                <p>Well, we had started at my suggestion really, a nuclear planning group which
                    still exists. We were anxious to be able to cut the non-nuclear allies in on
                    what nuclear war would be like and you couldn't deal with it. It was becoming a
                    lot more clear that there was no way you could have a nuclear war that you could
                    win. You'd shoot your own foot as badly as you would hit the other fellow's
                    foot.</p>
                <p>There had been an idea of setting up a multilateral force, MLF so-called, to be
                    another nuclear weapons system, surface ships, but we needed another nuclear
                    weapons system about as badly as a hole in the head. We finally suggested we set
                    up a group that included some of the non-nuclear allies, who would be rotated,
                    so the total number would be kept to fewer than the 15 members. We had 15, too
                    big for conducting serious conversations in secret. We established this group.
                    We had the first meeting in Washington, McNamara presiding, and the defense
                    ministers from the countries involved. One of them was Turkey. To everybody's
                    surprise, including the surprise of the security people surrounding us. McNamara
                    suddenly dives into this capacious briefcase and pulls out photographs,
                    satellite photographs, of a defense installation in Russia. The code name was a
                    classification that in itself was classified at the time and way above top
                    secret. You could just see the security people blanching and fidgeting. But that
                    was a case that we were taking this information sharing very seriously. Finally
                    I said to McNamara, he really had to be personally present every time we met,
                    otherwise it wouldn't work. He agreed to do that, and he did it.</p>
                <p>Clark Clifford succeeded him. When the Nixon administration came in, Mel Laird
                    also stuck by that principle. So we were dealing with nuclear policy by playing
                    war games, by having simulated exercises. You had to assume that the enemy would
                    come over into our territory first, but you couldn't assume anything about the
                    defensive alliance. You couldn't assume a preemptive strike ahead of time or
                    anything like that. We played a whole series of war games with these non-nuclear
                    defense people as well as the French and the British. We never could play a game
                    with these tactical nuclear forces where we didn't kill more people on our side
                    than the other side. You might mess up an invading brigade, but you also messed
                    up a number of communities in West Germany, mostly West Germany. So there was a
                    sudden diminution of the nonsense coming out of the political leadership in the
                    non-nuclear countries, particularly Germany. The plan worked, that is telling
                    people the nature of nuclear war turned out to be a much better way of educating
                    them than having them participate in a complicated surface force where everybody
                    got to do different things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, no, there was not really any. Just intelligence people on both
                    sides trying to figure out what the others were doing, but there was no real
                    cooperation in thinking through. That was one of the things that bothered us,
                    that they might think more highly of the possible advantages of using nuclear
                    weapons than we were inclined to. Everybody in our camp was of the opinion that
                    I came to, and that I think McNamara and some other top military leaders like
                    Admiral Noel Gayler, who was the commander in chief of the Pacific did. When he
                    retired, he said it was a weapon too big to use. I came to the conclusion, I
                    started calling it not the ultimate weapon but the ultimately unusable
                    weapon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had theorists and a sort of a lobby that was
                        particularly powerful in scientific circles. Edwin Teller is the name that
                        comes to mind. There were others who were playing games. If we lose two
                        million, they lose three, and somehow we'll come out ahead on this sort of
                        thing. Did you run across these people/? They tended to be more in the Nixon
                        era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, Teller actually was more active earlier in the argument about
                    going from the A-bomb to the H-bomb. Yes, there was always this overestimation,
                    and to some extent our own military politics and military dynamics tended to
                    exacerbate the problem. The three services were competing for having nuclear
                    weapons systems. The navy finally got the main deterrent system, the Polaris
                    submarine and its successors. The air force had the bombers that were
                    dual-capable as they called it. The army had the Pershing missile and other
                    howitzers that were also dual-capable. I visited all the main military
                    headquarters while I was in NATO. I learned a lot about the thinking, and the
                    thinking often hadn't carried deeply enough, the analysis of what would be the
                    effects of nuclear weapons both in the short term and the long term. Chernobyl
                    hadn't happened yet, so they weren't thinking about the world effects of nuclear
                    energy. Through all this time the Soviets, to answer your earlier question, were
                    just being implacably the enemy. They weren't really doing anything to help us
                    stop thinking of them as the implacable enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the time before de Gaulle finally said,
                        ‚ÄúEverybody get out‚Äù, there was this point in '65 when France was in the
                        military organization. Was the rest of NATO beginning to move around and
                        come up with the idea we can't depend on the French forces and make
                        contingency plans, contingency thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, the French really took care of that. They were in a way ahead of
                    the allies moving in that direction. Within the French military forces there
                    seemed to be some division of opinion. The cooperation in the Mediterranean with
                    the French navy was completely different. Even after de Gaulle's pull out, the
                    French navy continued to be part of NATO exercises in the Mediterranean which
                    obviously made military sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know when I was consul general in Naples in '79-'81 the
                        French navy was right there. In fact they were probably one of the strongest
                        contingents of the Mediterranean fleet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Indeed the pull out itself, the French pull out itself, was vastly
                    over estimated at first by the press and some comments coming from Washington. I
                    argued in a series of increasingly eloquent cables that here is a guy who is
                    doing something for domestic consumption and to some extent for Soviet
                    consumption, but what he had carefully not done is do things that would really
                    be harmful such as forbidding over flights over France and interfering with
                    communications through France. Both cases would have put a crimp on keeping the
                    Mediterranean and northern fronts as part of the same military system. I said
                    the fact that they haven't done anything about either of these indicates clearly
                    that de Gaulle has thought this through and is trying to make his public
                    declaration without hurting NATO. Don't let's help him hurt NATO more than he
                    wants to. That did finally prevail but it got a lot of argument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding that within the French military there was
                        some disquiet about pulling out? I would have thought that being by
                        themselves did harm the military readiness by not being part of the NATO
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, it did. I didn't pick up, but I wasn't really in a position to
                    pick up any dissension in the French military ranks. De Gaulle was so much in
                    charge, particularly as a military man. He was, in fact, a great thinker among
                    strategists of our time, which was revealed by the fact that he was able to pull
                    off this political operation without really hurting NATO. Gradually the French
                    got more and more cooperative with military exercises, and so on, but it has
                    never been an easy relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find you were there at a crucial time, of having
                        to work and tell everybody, ‚ÄúCool it. Don't aggravate the French anymore. Do
                        what we have to, but at the lower ranks, let's not go into a pout on this
                        thing?‚Äù</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I did that kind of education with my own mission and to some extent
                    with the other allies and with Washington. Fortunately, the president's
                    political instinct, President Johnson, and the advice he was getting from Dean
                    Rusk and others, George Ball, was very much along the same line. George Ball was
                    in public somewhat more exercised than others. He regarded it as almost a
                    personal affront.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told, I heard other people remark, that he wanted to
                        be very tough at the beginning on this, and it was Johnson who said let's
                        cool it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, George had worked in France, had been a consultant to the French
                    government. I think he almost felt personally affronted by the French getting
                    off the wavelength at this point. It is true that the President was very clear
                    on this from a very early stage which helped a lot. I was just trying to
                    reinforce that from where I sat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the British and French taking this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, the British were really pretty cool about it. There was no way
                    in which they could challenge the French anyway, so they didn't. In fact, it
                    wasn't even within the NATO circle. I think it was regarded more as a matter of
                    French-American relations than it was anything else. Even the Canadian angle,
                    which heated up when de Gaulle visited Quebec and said something to the effect
                    of, ‚ÄúVive le Quebec Libre.‚Äù The rest of the Canadians always will regard that as
                    an affront, but I didn't perceive their French relations as narrowly dicey as I
                    thought our relations with France had come to be. I suspect that most of them
                    felt that in the end that the relationship was going to be soured or sweetened
                    by what the Americans did. That is what I was working toward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any other sort of crises we had? I mean
                        this was a longstanding crisis, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That really lasted in a way the whole time I was there. And the
                    nuclear discussions were another theme that went all the way through. I learned
                    a lot about consultation, the nature of consultation. I wrote a book about NATO
                    as soon as I left the job that summer called NATO: The Transatlantic Bargain. I
                    have a couple of chapters in there that are, in fact, a general theory of
                    consultation which could apply in a lot of other contexts as well for foreign
                    service people.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>It was a particularly interesting and difficult assignment because in a way every
                    member of the North Atlantic Council, when they spoke up, was speaking to the
                    American representative, always trying to influence what the United States was
                    going to do. So I felt that I was in a position that I had to exercise some
                    leadership of the whole group while not seeming to, not being arrogant about it.
                    I solved this problem mostly by working very closely with and through the
                    Secretary General, who was a very bright, very wise, Italian diplomat. He and I
                    were very good friends. Many of the things we wanted done, we would suggest to
                    him that he take as an initiative. He wasn't just a patsy. He would think it
                    through himself, but we were very often on the same wavelength as him.</p>
                <p>So, as an education in the nature of multilateral diplomacy, it was a wonderful
                    experience. That's why I wanted to capture it in writing before I went on,
                    because I went from that job to the University of Hawaii, and I knew there
                    wouldn't be that much time for writing about NATO after I got to Hawaii. That
                    book, from the publishers point, was probably a dog.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: NATO: The Transatlantic Bargain. I am doing a session at the World
                    Future's Society this summer. The title is in effect the Transatlantic Bargain
                    Revisited now. Europe is becoming a union. I was always very much interested in
                    the future of Europe. I had gotten to know Jean Monnet back in the early days.
                    When my younger brother was a Foreign Service officer, his family actually was
                    assigned as part of his staff for awhile. My other brother Van had also been
                    very much involved in the State Department, earlier under the Marshall Plan and
                    later in the international economic economists area. He was also involved in the
                    early days of the European Union. He had a very warm feeling about the
                    importance of European integration. I was always watching; I was always looking
                    at the Transatlantic Bargain, NATO compact, as something that among other things
                    would make possible the Europeans coming together. It certainly had that effect
                    in gluing Germany to the west, and eventually gluing even East Germany to the
                    west. It had the effect that we all hoped it would have, that a war among
                    western European countries was inconceivable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, still remains to me a high priority to
                        keep the organization going because if you don't tend and water that
                        organization, people can start going their own different ways. You get
                        different sets of politicians and we see, particularly in Yugoslavia, you
                        get some particularly nasty politicians. You can end up with very bloody
                        conflicts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. I would have preferred to see an operation shortly after the cold
                    war was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick this up the next time. You have left the
                        government. You have left NATO and gone to the Hawaii center. We'll talk I
                        guess in our last go round about the role of a think tank and sort of the
                        academic side of global relations and your part in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is June 7, 1999. In 1969 the new Nixon administration came in and you went
                    out.</p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, I didn't go out right away. I stayed for, it turned out, almost
                    five months. They asked me to stay on. I had known Nixon a little bit. He had
                    visited me twice at NATO. I was always impressed by the fact that he was
                    genuinely interested in foreign policy. He was able to remember the second time
                    what I had said the first time that sort of thing. So they asked me to stay on.
                    Part of the problem was we had cleared with both Nixon and Humphrey, the
                    Democratic candidate, the notion of inviting NATO for the 20th anniversary
                    meeting. We have just now had the 50th anniversary meeting. This was the 20th
                    anniversary meeting of the North Atlantic Council. We wanted to hold it in
                    Washington, and both candidates had agreed that it was okay to plan that for
                    April which is the anniversary date. So we did that. I think that part of the
                    reason for asking me to stay on for a little bit was that it would have been
                    hard for somebody else to hit the ground running fast enough to organize that
                    particular event. I was still at NATO when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger
                    and others came for their first visit in person. I did some writing at Henry
                    Kissinger's request, about NATO. We had actually a very comfortable continuity
                    of policy because what we were doing at NATO was essentially what they wanted to
                    be doing at NATO also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there wasn't really much, in those days particularly,
                        political controversy over NATO, was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: None really at all. We had this huge meeting in Washington of all the
                    defense ministers and all the foreign ministers and heads of government. It was
                    a gigantic affair with huge dinners and so forth. When that was just winding
                    down, I was getting ready to go back to Brussels to clean up and leave. I was
                    just negotiating with the University of Hawaii about the terms and conditions of
                    coming out there as president of the university. I had a message to go up and
                    talk to the new Secretary of State who was Bill Rogers. To my surprise he
                    started mentioning other ambassadorships around the world I might be interested
                    in. He mentioned Greece, he mentioned the Philippines and so forth. I was pretty
                    much had my heart set on this next step if it happened. Just in that time in
                    that same week, I got a firm offer from the board of regents of the University
                    of Hawaii to come out there starting in the fall.</p>
                <p>Then I got another message to go over and visit the Secretary. He offered me the
                    ambassadorship to Italy. That was a different proposition from my point of view.
                    I had spent many years in Italy. I spoke some Italian, and it was much more
                    tempting. I like Italy, I liked the Italians and so forth. But we decided, Lois
                    and I in the end, that a lot of it would be more of the same. The way to grow is
                    to do something you didn't know how to do rather than do something that I
                    thought I did know how to do. I knew something about Italian politics and I knew
                    quite a lot about how to be an ambassador by then. So, we decided the University
                    of Hawaii would be more adventurous and interesting. It did turn out to be
                    indeed both adventurous and interesting.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: '74, five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in the fall of '69, what was the
                        university like? How did it impress you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I should mention as a parenthesis that I spent the summer writing a
                    book about NATO because I figured if I didn't write it then, I never would. I
                    holed up in Syracuse, New York, where we used to live, and wrote what I think
                    still stands as a pretty good history of NATO of the four years I was there and
                    some of the background.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The University of Hawaii was a very ambitious proposition not yet fulfilled. The
                    governor, who had been there for a long time, Jack Burns, was very high on
                    education. He saw education as the means of Hawaii becoming not just an
                    ex-colony but a state. Of course, it already had statehood by then for 10 years,
                    but still it was more a colony than anything else. All the people who wanted to
                    be doctors and lawyers had to go to the mainland for their graduate work and so
                    on. The university had a unique position in the scheme of things. It was the
                    whole of higher education for the state of Hawaii. Community colleges, a four
                    year college and a big central research oriented campus with some very strong
                    scientific departments, notably in geophysics, astronomy, in all the marine
                    sciences notably marine biology. There were obviously potentials there for
                    building a university around its marine environment out there in the middle of
                    the Pacific, and very good support from the people and the legislature and the
                    governor. I saw it as a very interesting and important opportunity for
                    institution building which is what I like to do rather than maintain
                    institutions, and so it was a very exciting prospect for me. I knew that
                    campuses all over the country were riled up with demonstrations about Vietnam. I
                    rather thought that was tailing off. It was on the mainland, but these things
                    happen in Hawaii about two years after the mainland. It is true of women's
                    fashions, too. We were having Berkeley 1967 in the fall of 1969 when I got
                    there, so my first year was taken up largely with crisis management.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I did manage to hold together a planning process during the fall, and over the
                    Christmas vacation, Lois and I went over to Maui and holed up in a hotel there
                    on the beach, and I wrote what I called a prospectus for the '70s for the
                    University of Hawaii based on a lot of work that had been done by a series of
                    committees headed up by a then vice president for academic affairs of the
                    university, Dick Kosaki. But I figured I didn't want it to have just a committee
                    product, so I issued it as a draft dated the first of January of 1970. It became
                    very well known because the editor of the morning newspaper, The Honolulu
                    Advertiser, George Chaplain, who had been one of the advocates of my getting the
                    job, decided to elbow aside all of his other op-ed writings and run this rather
                    long paper in I think seven different installments on the editorial page of The
                    Honolulu Advertiser. So even if everybody didn't read it, there was nobody who
                    could admit they hadn't read it. For years after that, legislators in committee
                    hearings about aspects of the university, some representative from the
                    university proposing something that would cost new money, the first question
                    would be, ‚ÄúWas that in the prospectus?‚Äù So that turned out to be a good planning
                    device. I issued it as a draft. It never got out of draft. It was just always
                    subject to criticism and re-writing, but never quite rewritten. But, most of the
                    time was spent dealing with the security problems on the campus. We had a whole
                    series of incidents, a so-called moratorium on attending class, a strike in
                    effect. We had the problem: what do you do when the students who have paid
                    tuition decide not to come to class in a body. If somebody had paid tuition and
                    doesn't come to class, that's his or her constitutional right. We were all
                    public employees of the state, the faculty and I and others, and it was
                    therefore up to us to be on the job and to turn up for our classes even if there
                    was nobody there. There was one situation in which a young history professor
                    picketed his own class to be sure that the students didn't attend. What happened
                    during that time was interesting because the librarian of the university, there
                    were several libraries scattered around the campus, reported there was a higher
                    use than in the history of the library during this one week period of strike. In
                    other words, a lot of students were taking vacations to bone up on what they
                    should have been boning up on anyway, so it had an educational value that I
                    hadn't quite anticipated. Another educational value that it had was that my
                    office was occupied several times by students, the leaders of the campus
                    demonstrations. They tended to be bright and feisty young people, so I turned
                    those sessions into seminars, gave them things to read, and we discussed them.
                    Raymond Aron, the French philosopher and journalist who wrote for Le Figaro in
                    Paris, had just come out with a book called Les Evenements du Soixante-huit, the
                    Events of '68.</p>
                <p>I was in the middle of describing the scene on the campus during this October
                    moratorium, which was an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. When the students would
                    occupy my office, I would stay there and conduct seminars with them about the
                    state of the world and even the state of what they were doing. Raymond Aron's
                    book was particularly useful because he had some analysis of sort of the
                    psychology of French students. He had one passage in which he said, ‚ÄúIt is
                    always possible to bring on the police brutality if you want to.‚Äù There were
                    many situations in which they provoked police brutality which as he put it,
                    ‚ÄúThey both desired and denounced.‚Äù So that was an interesting byproduct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the students who were doing this? One doesn't
                        think of the University of Hawaii as attracting the same sort of students
                        that might end up at Columbia or Michigan or at Berkeley.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, a few of them were alumni of the Berkeley demonstrations who
                    were living on the beaches and coming up to participate, but there were a good
                    many local students. One of the leaders was a young Fijian who was a very
                    effective political leader. So it was partly Pacific people and partly because
                    we had a lot of mainland students as well, so it wasn't a complete difference.
                    Interesting to me, though, was the fact that as I look back on it, the actions
                    taken were somewhat in keeping with the ‚Äúaloha spirit,‚Äù that is people would
                    stop short of violence. There was only one case of arson which it turned out was
                    the burning down of an ROTC building which was kind of a temporary building so
                    it was made of wood and easy to burn. That was done by a group of people from
                    outside the campus including, however, a former assistant professor of religion
                    who was participating in that protest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I don't think he was ever jailed for that. I was just delighted that
                    it wasn't one of our own students or faculty. As an exercise in crisis
                    management, it was interesting to me that in tranquil times, the students and
                    faculty members were really insisting on participating in the governance of the
                    university. When it came to a crisis in which people were occupying the
                    buildings and making a lot of noise outside. Of course it is easy to have an
                    outside demonstration any time of the year in Hawaii because the weather is
                    almost always good, I didn't find any line forming at my door to help
                    participate in handling it. It was something I had to handle myself with my own
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your faculty on something like this? Was
                        it the usual, the young instructors, assistant professors would be more
                        radical than the older ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. There was one fellow, there had been a big row just before I got
                    there, it was settled just before I got there. It had to be before they could
                    hire anybody. An associate professor of political science had been denied tenure
                    through a procedure that was not very well thought through. It was that incident
                    that derailed my predecessor. He was one of the firebrands, and there was a man
                    there, a senior professor, an historian, who later produced a whole series of
                    books of documents about Adlai Stevenson's career. He was very much a radical in
                    those terms. Mostly it was the younger members of the faculty, which I guess was
                    true everywhere, and some of the brightest members of the student body. I met
                    them, got to know some of them very well because they were in my office a lot.
                    It was a little bit hairy at times. We had three threats to my life and to the
                    family. I consulted the FBI about the threats. The local FBI chief told me that
                    I needn't worry because it wasn't the people who make overt threats that
                    actually carry out assassinations. That wasn't altogether comforting. We had to
                    have the hood wired shut in our personal car so nobody could put anything in the
                    engine. The police later found that one of the threats had been a phony, had
                    been called in by the university security officer who had been assigned to
                    protect me and drove my car during that period. The rest of the time he was on
                    our porch being fed goodies by our housekeeper. It turned out that he rather
                    liked this tour of duty and tried to extend it by adding another threat. The
                    other two apparently were real, but nothing came of them. On the whole, while it
                    divided the community and the campus, of course, most of the time I had the
                    feeling that by keeping my cool, I could help cool things off. I did some
                    writing about it at the time. I wrote a long piece; it was a two part piece that
                    ran in one of the local newspapers called Dissent and Disruption. It kind of
                    reviewed a lot of literature on the subject and analyzed why we were handling it
                    the way we were and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the brand new guy on the block, and all of a
                        sudden you find yourself up against this. How well were you supported by the
                        political establishment and the university establishment, the trustees and
                        so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There was very good support because nobody wanted us to knock students
                    over the head, you know. Most of the demonstrations were not violent, so we had
                    a deal with the police who would come in when we asked them. They would be right
                    on the TV near the campus, but they would come only when we asked them because
                    we were afraid that their presence might produce more trouble than otherwise.
                    The very bright, relatively young police chief of Honolulu, who had a master's
                    degree in sociology, really thought about the situation very hard, so it was
                    very good to work with him.</p>
                <p>The only problem we had in the political establishment was the mayor of Honolulu
                    who was running for governor the next time, and who lay low during the period of
                    the most disruptions. Then, when we had calmed it down, he came out with a
                    statement about the pusillanimous university administrators who don't know how
                    to handle these things.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I had gotten to know Claire Booth Luce quite well who lived there. We were at her
                    house several times. During the spring of that first academic year, she wrote a
                    letter to the newspaper complaining about weak-kneed university administrators.
                    Interestingly, she went on a long trip to Europe and I think the Middle East too
                    during the summer. When she came back, she wrote me in effect a letter of
                    apology. From then on, we were on every one of her guest lists. When Buckminster
                    Fuller came to town and had an 80th birthday party at her house, we were
                    invited, that sort of thing. She was wise enough not to invite us to come to a
                    purely Republican affair when Nixon turned up, although I might have gone since
                    I had been a member of his administration. I would say on the whole, most of the
                    political leaders were inclined to let us handle. Even the regents were inclined
                    to say that is something the president should handle. I wasn't getting a lot of
                    pro-demonstrator flak from outside the campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you had the moratorium, you kept the classes going
                        even though people didn't go to them, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That was it. That was our doctrine, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out? Did you give exams at the end of the
                        year and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. It only lasted a week, so it was not a big deal. As I say a very
                    large number of the students were in the library during that week, so I really
                    don't think they missed anything much. We recommended, the administration, the
                    university recommended, that every faculty member find ways of discussing the
                    Vietnam situation in the class from their point of view, whether it was chemical
                    engineering or political science or whatever, because if that is what the
                    students are interested in, that is a good way of you build education on what
                    people are paying attention to.</p>
                <p>A good deal of this was going on all through the first year. It kind of tapered
                    off after that. It didn't actually prevent us from getting on with the academic
                    side of the business. The prospectus was a big factor in that, I think. Also, I
                    was able to attract a brilliant and still relatively young scientist to come and
                    be dean of marine programs as a kind of coordinator of all our marine science
                    activities. He developed some very popular undergraduate programs, a marine
                    option on your diploma and so forth, which involved not only study but also
                    getting out on the ocean in sailboats and swimming and so forth, and of course
                    learning about marine biology and marine geophysics.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>The university was growing quite fast. We were doing a lot of planning: do we
                    need a new community college here, and do we need another four-year campus? We
                    had one four-year campus. We reorganized the arrangements on the big island. We
                    had a four-year campus and a community college. We had a big Peace Corps
                    training institute which had mutated into an overseas training institute. We put
                    all of those together in what we called the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and
                    put a chancellor in charge of that. Almost every day or two, there would be
                    something about the university in the newspapers. Everything that happened on
                    the campus was, of course, free game for the newspapers.</p>
                <p>My last year there, we figured that the university had one out of every 16 people
                    in the Hawaiian Islands as its student. If you added up in California, the
                    University of California system, and the state university system, and the
                    community college system, you could get to one out of every 19 people in
                    California, a student in one of those systems. We had all of those systems in
                    one, of course in microcosm, but it meant that my last year there, we actually
                    had about 52,000 students on nine campuses out of a population at that time of
                    about 800,000 residents. It didn't count the six million visitors a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that one of your biggest problems
                        would be just the expense of everyone, the students and faculty, living in
                        Hawaii. Hawaii is an expensive place. Everything has to be imported.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, it is, but for the local people, they were used to that, of
                    course and a lot that you don't need. You don't need heavy clothing and you
                    don't need heating and so forth. So there are some offsets to that, the high
                    costs the tourists feels there. I was used to services that local people don't
                    think they need. You don't have to pay to go to a beach. All the beaches are
                    public. That is one of the wise provisions that was made early on in the state
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your background, did you find that you were pushing
                        or focusing more of the university toward the international field, both
                        economic and political?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, I was constantly pushing that, and it seemed a kind of natural
                    thing to do because there we were five hours from our own mainland and only a
                    little farther to Japan and the Far East, and with people who were an ethnic
                    mix. I used to go around saying everybody is a minority. We don't have a
                    situation where you are a member of a minority; everybody is a minority. We
                    developed a university wide council on international affairs and tried to push a
                    more global perspective into the educational process. So, just as I had tried to
                    do at the Maxwell School while I was there much earlier, and as I again did in
                    Minnesota later on, I was always pushing the idea that Americans needed to
                    understand about the whole world.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>One thing that I pushed quite hard was getting overseas experience. In many
                    cases, the students reacted very positively to that because what you had was
                    students in a generation where they had resisted having to be bicultural. The
                    Japanese boy or girl would try very hard to be an American and didn't want to be
                    thought of as a Japanese, would even resist learning Japanese. I once arranged a
                    special opportunity for a very bright student of electrical engineering to go to
                    Japan for a year as part of a process and financed by a donor. When I asked him
                    to come in and talk about it, he asked exactly the wrong question. He said,
                    ‚ÄúDoes it lead to being an electrical engineer?‚Äù I told him, ‚ÄúNo, it leads to
                    being a more interesting person, bilingual and bicultural and taking advantage
                    of his own genealogy.‚Äù He finally did it, but it wasn't an automatic sale in his
                    case. But in many cases it was, and that was sort of a popular thing to do, of
                    course. So, I had some special experiences like that with people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much directing people toward the Foreign
                        Service? I am talking about the Foreign Service in its broader sense, AID,
                        USIA, CIA, other things like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, there were some members of the faculty that had some kinds of
                    experience along those lines, so there was a good deal of that kind of
                    encouragement, informally. We never really had a formal situation, and we didn't
                    really have much in the way of recruiters coming out to do it. Probably they
                    would have difficulty justifying to their own offices the expense of going to
                    Hawaii to work, you know, when people thought the main reason to go to Hawaii
                    was just to not work. On the other hand, the weather was a great recruitment
                    device for us to get first rate faculty. We'd wait until about February and then
                    invite them out for a week, which is what they had done to us. They invited us
                    out during the spring, Lois and me, first class travel, all expenses paid for a
                    week. That was almost unfair to come from Brussels where you never see the sun
                    for several months to Hawaii where you see the sun every day. So, we got some
                    very good people we were able to hire away from Michigan and MIT and the
                    University of California and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the university probably had more orientation
                        towards Asia than most other American universities do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes, and a lot of that was natural to the situation. Again I pushed it
                    very hard. One of the things I said in the prospectus was we were already the
                    Korean study center of the nation. If you looked around, you found at Harvard
                    that one person's full time job was full-time research activity on Korea. I
                    think at Columbia there were two such people, and that was the highest number in
                    any place. We looked around and found we had 15 people whose whole life was
                    studying Korea, some of them Koreans, but not all of them. We managed to develop
                    the idea that we should have a Korean study center for we were the Korean study
                    center. So then, I made a trip to Korea with the help of a guy we had hired from
                    I forget where, Tulane or somewhere. We wanted to carefully calibrate it between
                    the Korean government and business and so on. There was a lot of trouble between
                    the government and everybody else there at the time. I visited several of the
                    universities, and we raised quite a lot of money from the Korean government for
                    a building. Then we came back and raised quite a lot more from not only the
                    Korean community, which is relatively small, but really from all the Asian
                    communities to have one building on the campus that would clearly be an Asian
                    style architecture. We finally built a really spectacular building with curved
                    roofs and painted tile and so on, the whole, and it was the Korean studies
                    center in a place that was right near the East-West Center which was also part
                    of the university while I was there. It was our tenth campus in effect though it
                    was on the main campus.</p>
                <p>There were many opportunities for making new things happen that hadn't been done
                    before. One year, I got the legislature to let me reserve in my office, one
                    percent of the academic budget. It was called the President's innovation fund,
                    and it could only be used for things that hadn't been done before. One professor
                    of speech was very much interested in satellite communication. He came up one
                    day and said that the government had a satellite that had already been around
                    for five years, and that they had just announced that they were not going to use
                    the satellite anymore and anybody who wanted to use it for a good educational or
                    non-profit purpose, they could. He said by using this satellite, we could
                    probably develop a whole network around the Pacific of all the educational
                    institutions in the Pacific. He was associated with a wonderful crazy electrical
                    engineer who was a ham radio buff and who said that he could build a ground
                    station on the top of the engineering building, which was flat, to communicate
                    with that satellite. We said, ‚ÄúOkay. Now how much would that cost?‚Äù He said,
                    ‚ÄúWell, I can do it for $5,000.‚Äù I appropriated $5,000 out of the innovation
                    fund. He built it for about $2,400, and staffed it with enthusiastic graduate
                    students. We then persuaded all the other institutions in Papua New Guinea and
                    the University in Fiji, the University of the South Pacific. The king of Tonga
                    figured they had better get into the act. The Polytechnic Institute in New
                    Zealand which was just playing around with satellite communications noticed that
                    we were beginning with ATS-1 which was the name of the satellite, Advanced
                    Technology Satellite #1, I got a letter out of the blue saying they would like
                    to participate in whatever we were doing. We had somebody at the University of
                    Alaska. So before we got through in a year and a half, or two years, we had a
                    whole network which operated for several hours every day exchanging information,
                    holding conferences, and so forth among the educators of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>That, like everything else, leads to unexpected political dilemmas. One decided
                    that our network would be a good way to recruit people to come out against the
                    French nuclear sites in the Pacific. I had to rule that it wasn't usable for any
                    such purpose even though I agreed with it.</p>
                <p>The general support for the university was very strong in most of the years until
                    the last year I was there. The governor would go into a relatively tight budget
                    in general. That was his general philosophy. Then the legislators would spend
                    all of the first half of the year adding things to his budget. They never cut
                    his budget. It would have been terrible to cut it. They all got political credit
                    for adding things to the budget. Then all that was stacked on the governor's
                    desk, and during the fall, the governor would release goodies of various sorts
                    which meant the governor had contrived to make the legislature the authorizing
                    body while he was the appropriations body. It was a very clever way to work.
                    Anyway, the result was we not only got our basic cost well supplied but we got a
                    lot of innovative things done by the legislature. We were a popular place for
                    doing things because their constituents were all people who by that time had
                    gotten the idea that all of their kids were going to go to college.</p>
                <p>We went through a process a little the way Korea went through in the second half
                    of the 20th century of starting with a decision that universal education was
                    produced by the dynamics of the Korean War, a technological war. The generals
                    that started the process couldn't stop it. They found that everybody wanted
                    their children to go to college. Well, that was very much the feeling. I also
                    developed the idea that if a student came to community college, and did well
                    enough to have 60 credit hours of transferable work, not machine shop or that
                    kind of thing, but anything that would be college work, that they ought to have
                    a right to go to either one of our four year colleges or to the university
                    campus itself. The Minoa campus had 23,000 students. That took a lot of
                    bargaining and negotiation with the faculty because they felt they would be
                    getting inferior students this way. We finally got through the fact that it was
                    an entitlement of people who did well enough at the community college to
                    transfer to the Minoa campus. In my last faculty meeting, a peculiar arrangement
                    there, as the president presides over the faculty senate meetings, I was able to
                    announce that the students graduating that June, comparing those who had started
                    in community colleges with those who started on the main campus, the ones that
                    started on the community college campuses had a slightly higher grade point
                    average than the ones who had been there all along, which was greeted by sort of
                    a hushed shock. But, there were many opportunities for educational
                    experimentation in Hawaii. We really did create a true open admissions system
                    for the state, and that is one of the few states, maybe the only one. They talk
                    about open admissions for everybody; we were really making it happen</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the native Hawaiians, the Polynesians a problem or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well first of all, the native Hawaiians, there is almost no purity of
                    Hawaiians. Everybody is a mestizo, a mixture. As they say, ‚ÄúWe are all mix up.‚Äù
                    There were many who were regarded as Hawaiians or part Hawaiians, and who had
                    special privileges as a result. For example, there was a very good school, the
                    Kamehameha School which was only available to people who were part Hawaiian.
                    While I was there, the proportion of Hawaiian you had to be to get in kept
                    dwindling. It got down to one-thirty second or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this because of the lack of having enough really full
                        blooded Hawaiians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. But there were political groups that were important, and it was
                    important in doing anything. Managing anything in Hawaii was a little like
                    managing Tammany Hall. You had to be sure that every ethnic group was buying
                    into what you were trying to do. We established a university wide advisory
                    committee to me which was part of trying to get everybody in. I remember
                    spending a weekend trying to figure out how to get a universe of 36 people
                    statewide who would really represent the state. Toward the end of Sunday
                    afternoon, my assistant suddenly pokes me in the ribs and says, ‚ÄúI think we have
                    got it made if we can just find a Korean woman from Kauai, then we will have the
                    balance right.‚Äù We were always playing ethnic politics. The Hawaiians and
                    part-Hawaiians had been stacked at the bottom of the heap. All the immigrants
                    from elsewhere, the mainland, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, tended to be better
                    off than they were. That was partly cultural, partly there was something about
                    Polynesian culture that they describe as crabs in a bucket. That is if one gets
                    to the top of the bucket and wants to look around, the other crabs will drag it
                    back down. That was often used as a reason for why things were the way they
                    were.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there were some very bright and ambitious Hawaiian students or
                    part-Hawaiian students, who were very anxious to help the younger ones. We
                    finally had a dinner on our porch. Everything can be done outside there, so it
                    is nice. We had a dinner on our porch where we had a number of the senior
                    students and some of the main drumbeaters for Hawaiian rights from around the
                    community to consider what we ought to do about this, about helping the
                    Hawaiians who were often having academic trouble. What they really recommended
                    and what we did was to establish a sort of homeroom for the Hawaiians right in
                    the middle of the campus. We cleared out a couple or three classrooms on the
                    first floor of a classroom building and built a very pleasant library with books
                    and a place to sit and read and so on. The arrangement was that some of the
                    senior students would be kind of in charge of this, which meant that the
                    freshmen and sophomores who were Hawaiian could sort of repair there and get
                    charged up again and be told they were as good as everybody else and to act like
                    it and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the Hawaiian students being able to
                        have a place to go and get help from their seniors and get them back on the
                        campus again.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: That worked. In other words there is a dynamic on every campus of
                    ethnic groups having lunch together, segregating themselves. I didn't want to
                    have a situation where we tried to solve the segregation problem by too much
                    segregation, but in this particular case, I thought it was good doctrine to have
                    a battery charging part of the society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Protecting our culture. Today one of the big problems at
                        the University of California at Berkeley is, they have got so many students
                        of Japanese ancestry who do so well in the more engineering type courses,
                        and the Chinese too, that they sort of swamp anchors with everyone else. You
                        almost have to have reverse discrimination in order to keep these places
                        from being completely Asian dominated. Did you have that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: We had that. It wasn't a problem; it was an incentive. It was true the
                    oriental students, students of oriental parentage even if they hadn't lived
                    there, their family upbringing, their whole cultural situation was that school
                    is a place you had to work hard to get somewhere. Sometimes when I would go past
                    the library, I'd look in a whole series of windows with cubicles where students
                    would be studying. I'd be astonished at the very high proportion of people with
                    oriental faces because it was a high proportion anyway, but even higher than you
                    would expect, who were studying in the library. But, one of the results of that
                    was that it enlivened the other students academically. I used to claim our
                    students probably had on the average higher student relation than any campus in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways you are replicating what happened
                        particularly in New York City in the '30s and '40s with the children of
                        Jewish immigrants coming in who were adding an awful lot of intellectual
                        stimulus to the universities there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Right, and we, of course, had it built in spades because something
                    like two-thirds of our students were of oriental parentage. Most of them were
                    actually local, and about a third were either people who came to college or
                    graduate school, particularly graduate school from the mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any movement at that point of young Japanese
                        women from Japan who were attracted to going to school in Hawaii because of
                        the discrimination against women in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, there may have been some of that, but it wasn't a major
                    phenomenon or it would have been more discussed. We did have a good many
                    students from Japan but there was a resistance apparently in Japan to sending
                    people particularly women to Hawaii because when they came home, they'd be
                    acting different. They'd be walking different, and it was uncomfortable for the
                    parents and associates and so on. It was a problem for women of oriental
                    parentage in a way because when they would go to Japan, everybody would
                    immediately assume they were fluent in Japanese which many of them were not, and
                    were shocked to find them striding down the street in an American way. So there
                    was a real cultural accommodation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of the East-West Center at that
                        particular point? What was that playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, it was a very important role. The arrangement was that they had
                    a lot of research programs, but they didn't give degrees, and so a lot of people
                    studying for graduate degrees at the University of Hawaii were really working in
                    the East-West Center. A number of people in the Center also held faculty
                    positions in the university, so it was a big subsidy to the university, to the
                    state to have these people coming in and be able to look forward to have a
                    Pacific conference on something and so on which otherwise we might not have been
                    able to do. Toward the end of my time there, it began to look as if it would be
                    very important in getting the money from Congress each year, if we could
                    indicate we were raising some real money in Asia, in Korea, in Thailand, in
                    Japan and other countries where there was a lot of money and people were doing
                    very well. So, my last year there we reorganized the East-West Center and set it
                    up with its own board, a very strong board that included a number of high level
                    Asians, scholars more than politicians. It was still there on the Minoa campus,
                    and there was still a lot of interaction on the graduate level. I felt that you
                    couldn't really go to Thailand and ask them for a grant to the state board of
                    regents. In the United States, it just wouldn't work. In fact, it hadn't been
                    terribly successful as a fund raising device, but to my surprise, the Congress
                    has stayed with it all this time, partly because Senator Daniel Inouye is always
                    available to help in Congress, and he has been very senior and very influential
                    member of the Senate for many years. I think we were lucky we had good political
                    support on the Washington end, good state support, and a number of friends in
                    key countries of Asia who helped us maintain the reputation of the East-West
                    Center. It is a dicey kind of organization to have at any university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think it was better to have it set up with its own board but to work
                    closely with the university. Part of the deal was they wouldn't go into the
                    degree giving business in competition. As far as I know, they haven't ever done
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '74 you left the University of Hawaii. Then
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I left because the political support and budgetary support was
                    beginning to run out, and it looked as if it were going to be a maintenance job.
                    Also several members of the board of regents really felt there ought to be a
                    local Hawaiian, a person born in Hawaii, as president. To hedge that bet, I had
                    built into our administration a vice president for business affairs, a very
                    bright Japanese American, Fujio Matsuda, who had been a member of the governor's
                    cabinet as head of transportation and in fact presided over the huge enlargement
                    of the Honolulu international airport.</p>
                <p>So, when I announced I would be leaving at the end of my fifth year, the
                    worldwide search came up with him as the next president. I'd do an oral history
                    of him too. By chance I ran into the president of the Aspen Institute when I was
                    at the Ford Foundation looking for money. He had worked in the Ford Foundation
                    before, and he was there, and I met him in an elevator. I had known him
                    somewhat. He asked me how it was going, what I was doing, and I told him the
                    situation that I was leaving. So, he perked up his ears and soon offered me a
                    job of starting an international program for the Aspen Institute which had been
                    primarily domestic in orientation before that. He wanted me to help
                    internationalize their board, which I did by getting several people that I had
                    worked with on their board, and also to establish a subsequent program in
                    international affairs. I did that for six years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be '74 to '80.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: '74 to '80. They had established a headquarters in Princeton, but they
                    said you can establish it anywhere you want, but not as far as Hawaii. So, we
                    established it in Princeton. Then for two or three months every summer we were
                    in Aspen, so we were constantly moving from one place to another. I got a lot of
                    work done, books written and ambitious research projects accomplished.
                    Essentially it consisted of me and an assistant and a secretary, a big travel
                    budget and a happy travel agency and so on.Could I just interrupt a bit. I need
                    to call on this executive committee of the American Refugee Committee, so if we
                    need to run on for a bit, maybe we could do one more interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, sure, we'll do that then. I want to make a note
                        here that you just showed me an oral history the University of Hawaii had at
                        Manoa done November 1998 about the presidents of the University of Hawaii,
                        so if there is somebody who wants to add on to what we are doing here, we
                        will refer them to there which I assume will be available at the University
                        of Hawaii.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 10th of September 1999. We are going to pick this up after the Aspen
                    Institute, and if you could tell me what did you do after 1980.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Well, in 1980 I got a telephone call from an economist named Walter
                    Heller, who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Kennedy
                    administration. I had gotten to know him well. He was back on the faculty of the
                    University of Minnesota where he had always been. He called up to say they were
                    starting a new public affairs school. They were going to call it the Hubert H.
                    Humphrey School of Public Affairs, There would be a combination of graduate
                    school, continuing education, and research. He said eventually they would get
                    around to trying to find somebody to run it, but for the moment they are just
                    trying to expedite the university into something important and useful. They had
                    already hired professionals, and we would like to use my name as the kind of
                    person who ought to be the dean. Hubert Humphrey's sister, whom we knew in
                    Washington, had already mentioned that possibility to me. So, I said, sure, you
                    can mention me if you want. One thing led to another, and I was offered the job
                    and we decided to move from New Jersey to Minneapolis and start a new life
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at the university from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: University of Minnesota, from 1980 to 1988. I retired in 1988 as a
                    professor emeritus, but I found an office in the building that I'd helped build,
                    and remained for a time. I was still engaged in a big international research
                    project, rethinking international governance which became eventually my 1993
                    book, Birth of a New World.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back and talk about the time from '80 to '88. Was
                        the school dedicated to national or international service? What was it
                        trying to train?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was attracting people who were interested in public affairs broadly
                    construed. The kind of people who wanted to get jobs and some of them did get
                    jobs in the public affairs or environment divisions of corporations. Our concept
                    was that public affairs isn't a new discipline or a new subject. It is the
                    integration of a lot of disciplines and subjects; therefore, it was inherently
                    an interdisciplinary program. I thought of it as kind of vestibule to the
                    university which was already managed by disciplines, former ways of thinking.
                    But the outside community was organized by problems that they were trying to get
                    out of. What should we do about this new highway system or what should we do
                    about the health program or social security and so on. In order to look
                    systematically at any of those problems, you had to use the insights and
                    methodologies of several, sometimes many, academic disciplines. That meant that
                    the people in the university had some difficulty understanding why the
                    university should have a thing like this in it. What was the basic
                    discipline?</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>The community people outside also had some difficulty understanding how we were
                    organized or how we were... Of course, we had to serve as some kind of
                    switchboard between the disciplinary setup of the university and the problem
                    orientation of the community. So I was constantly explaining to both sides what
                    we were up to. We decided on a personnel policy. We had inherited a small
                    school, and we added to its faculty. Then we did two other things. We decided we
                    wanted to make treaties with the various disciplinary departments. What we did
                    was to try to get the best people in political science, economics and so on to
                    be part time with us. We paid for part of their salary, and they became adjunct
                    professors with us. They were sort of adding what was called senior fellows who
                    were career practitioners in various fields. Some journalists, people who had
                    been in government, people who had been in business, people who had been very
                    well known in women's affairs and so on. We tried to get them recognized within
                    the university as members of the university faculty. They were full members of
                    our faculty, but to members of the university faculty, they would have had to be
                    have Ph.D.s and so forth. I found that the only reason for being a member of the
                    university faculty would be you could enjoy a seat on the university senate.
                    None of the people we brought in were the least interested in being on the
                    university senate at all. So, it didn't matter very much that they were not
                    formally members, they had all the rights and privileges. Inside they were
                    treated just like other faculty members with all the health benefits, retirement
                    benefits and so on that the professors had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, was this graduate or undergraduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Graduate, unlike the Maxwell School which was both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of a concentration on Midwestern or
                        international affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: There was a concentration on whatever the faculty and senior fellows
                    really wanted to work on. We had a public affairs degree and a planning degree
                    also. Those were our degree programs. Otherwise, in terms of research, we were
                    doing some things locally, some things in education, and things on national
                    affairs, and quite a lot on international affairs because of course, that is
                    what I was interested in. Some of the people I brought in, that was their
                    central interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>So it was a very wide agenda. I know we didn't have as much money as the JFK
                    School at Harvard or the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. We were in pretty
                    good shape. We raised a lot of money outside. When I first took the job to build
                    this institute, they already had $12,000,000 that they had raised apparently
                    while Humphrey was still alive. We more than doubled that, and got a number of
                    endowed chairs and several sizable research budgets. We had a big grant for
                    several years from the Agency for International Development, AID, to conduct
                    environmental education in Eastern Europe and Russia, particularly the Eastern
                    European countries. One of the legacies of communism was just a lot of dirt, a
                    lot of toxic chemicals and so on. We had a Polish senior fellow who was an
                    environmental economist himself, and he did a wonderful job of putting together
                    a major project.</p>
                <p>I developed a project that we called Rethinking International Governance chaired
                    with another one of the senior fellows, Geri Joseph, who had been Ambassador to
                    the Netherlands, and had been a quite close friend of Hubert Humphrey, and at
                    one point had been the top woman in the Democratic National Committee as well as
                    the committee from Minnesota. She was in charge of women's affairs there. She
                    and I conducted this really very large project. We got, all together, 31 people
                    from 22 different countries who were willing to participate without a consulting
                    fee, just travel expenses. We brought them together four different times. The
                    puzzle we were working at was, starting in 1985 or '86, how should the
                    international world get reorganized once the cold war was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were at the Hubert Humphrey Center. Did you find
                        that being considerably removed from Washington made it harder to have a
                        connect with sort of things happening in the real world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: No, actually I found an interesting thing. Being five hours from
                    Washington, I didn't need to think about each appropriation or each tactical
                    move, and I was able to develop a much more strategic sense of what the U.S.
                    government was, what was going on in the world. I was reading the New York Times
                    every day after all, and I was working on this international research project
                    which was very broad. That required a lot of consultation with people all over
                    the world. I thought that I was very much in the world. Also the twin cities of
                    Minnesota are extraordinary in the density of people who are really passionately
                    interested in public affairs including international affairs. I used to say
                    there were more policy knocks per square foot in the twin cities than any place
                    in the world. I think it would have been quite difficult to build a major
                    national, international public affairs school in most other cities in the
                    Midwest area or elsewhere, but doing it in Minnesota and doing it in Humphrey's
                    name made the whole thing go extremely well. We got a total of about $18,000,000
                    from the legislature to build a building that was partly occupied by business
                    school people because they had an overflow. But it was mostly ours, and it was a
                    lovely facility, a very excellent piece of architecture. It was an architect
                    that really listened to what we said, to our objectives and some of the problems
                    we foresaw. For example, I told the architect that there have to be spaces that
                    fit between calling somebody on the telephone and having lunch with somebody,
                    where you didn't want to develop an hour or hour and a half, but you couldn't do
                    it in five minutes. So he built into the stairway that went into a big atrium,
                    there was a stairway that sent from the first floor to the second and third
                    floor. He built into the stairway at each corner, a sort of pod where people
                    could go off and sit on benches and talk. Those pods were heavily used by
                    students in between classes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a great idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: A very nice idea. It was probably patterned after in a different way
                    the JFK school. We studied all the other schools. He bid very low for the job
                    because he was a great fan of Humphrey's. He wanted to be the architect who did
                    the Humphrey building. It was important to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did this until '88. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Then I stayed there, Lois and I stayed there, moving after awhile from
                    Medina, a suburb where we had a big house because we needed it for entertaining
                    visitors and all that sort of thing. We moved into town, got a quite large
                    apartment, a downtown condominium where we were just a few blocks from the
                    orchestra hall and from the best theater. The Guthrie Theater is one of the best
                    orchestra venues in the country and quite near downtown shopping. So, it was
                    quite convenient arrangement for us. We were very happy there.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>We were beginning to wonder whether we needed the Minnesota winters for the rest
                    of our lives. In the wintertime you kind of stay indoors and not go out at
                    night. We got a letter out of the blue from this place called Falcon's]Landing,
                    which hadn't been built yet, saying they started with Air Force retired officers
                    but they think they are going to run out of Air Force retirees and they are
                    opening it up to other categories. The fact that I had been Ambassador to NATO
                    automatically put me on that list. I was coming down to Washington anyway the
                    next week after that letter. Lois came down with me and we came out and looked
                    at the plan. We decided to bid on it, and got the house that you are now sitting
                    in. It is a house without the disadvantages of a house, the shoveling and the
                    planting and the mowing and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else with you? You have continued with your writing,
                        haven't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Yes. I finally got that book out. A little bit off because I had a
                    heart attack in 1992 when the book was manuscript without publishers to look at.
                    As I came out of a coma about three weeks later, the first news I had was I did
                    have a firm offer for publishing the book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a nice surprise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I didn't do religion for a while, and I didn't have any idea how to
                    handle this kind of book, and I just kind of did it myself. One of my friends
                    was chairman of a literary advisory group. He recommended that it would be very
                    good, and it was a shoo-in after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is excellent. I think this part is a good place
                        to stop. I want to thank you very much. This is great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: You are very welcome.</p>
