                <p>AMBASSADOR PATRICIA GATES LYNCH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 26, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 26, 1992. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch which is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. The
                        Ambassador will first speak about her assignment to Madagascar and then we
                        will move back to other times in the armed forces network, Voice of America
                        and all that. Madam Ambassador, I wonder if you can give me a little bit
                        about your background—where did you grow up, where were you educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I grew up in New Canaan, Connecticut which is not too far from New York
                    City. I had the great advantage of living in a very small, beautiful little
                    colonial town and at the same time being close to New York where, of course, my
                    mother took me to the Planetarium and all the museums, the theater, etc. I
                    appreciate that because it was a wonderful place to grow up. I have a theory
                    that perhaps New England, with its harsh winters, conditions one a little bit
                    for the ups and downs of life as you go along. So I am very happy to be from New
                    England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I went to school at a place called the New Canaan Country School and I
                    have often said that the man who was the head of that school probably influenced
                    my interests in foreign affairs. His name was Henry Wells. He had spent most of
                    his life in China where he was head of the American Missionary School there.
                    Even though we were all very young going to that school, we would have frequent
                    lectures by him about China and the difficulties between the Japanese and the
                    Chinese. How they lived in that part of the world. It was an exposure that most
                    youngsters don't have. I have been interested that people like Hedrick Smith,
                    also went to that school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is working for the New York Times now, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Well he is free lance now, but he does a great deal of television. He
                    wrote The New Russians and about power in Washington.</p>
                <p>I think that was an important beginning. My family also was very much interested
                    in what was going on in various parts of the world.</p>
                <p>Then I went on to a school in Stamford, Connecticut called the Low-Heywood
                    School. Those were the days when you had schools for girls not mixed the way
                    things have become today. It was interesting there...it was an excellent school
                    run by an English head mistress. Again it was a classical education. Four years
                    of Latin and many years of French. I was fortunate enough to have the offer and
                    everything forthcoming for a four-year scholarship to college, but these were
                    the war years. I didn't take it because I had met a young man who was at the
                    military academy at West Point and he was going off to war when he graduated and
                    he wanted very much to get married before he went off. So I had this great
                    choice of college or going to be with this young cadet who graduated. I decided
                    to get married which was quite different from everything I had ever planned for.
                    Of course, going to college then wasn't as necessary as it is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The pressures of the war years is often
                        misunderstood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Although I have done all my studying as I have gone along through
                    life...oh, that reminds me what I said to the head mistress when I wanted to get
                    married and it was just before graduation and she said, “Well they have done it
                    at Vassar, and I see no reason why we can't make an exception for you. I like
                    your young man and I know that you will go on learning all through life and that
                    is what education is all about.” And I have always appreciated her. She has been
                    dead for a long time now. That and the other thing was that my mathematics
                    teacher was very under-standing. That was my weakest subject. I was all right in
                    everything else, but math was a little bit weak...which may have been
                    psychological. You know they always told women that you aren't supposed to do
                    math.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to a male prep school in Kent, Connecticut and math
                        was my worse subject too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: My math teacher, years later when I was working at the White House, was
                    visited by the FBI and asked all about me. She wrote me a note and said, “Oh, I
                    told them all about you, our relationship, what you did in school, and finally
                    they said, 'Will you tell us something negative? Can't you remember anything
                    negative?' I thought and thought and finally said you weren't very good at
                    math.” I love that story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got married and looking sort of careerwise what
                        happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Well, of course, that is where again the foreign education stepped right
                    in because I married a wonderful, bright, young lieutenant and he went off to
                    war after we had been married for almost a year. We had traveled some in the
                    United States...Wisconsin, Tennessee. Then he went off to Burma and I followed
                    the news assiduously. I was doing things with theater because that had been
                    something I was interested in. I worked with the American Theater Wing in New
                    York, putting on shows. One of the people I remember doing a war bond show with
                    was the man who played the Shadow. Now people today won't remember the Shadow,
                    but I had always thought of him as being a great big rather forbidding man.
                    Actually he was a short, bald, very pleasant older man. He played my father and
                    I played the daughter in these skits that we did. Then I did a little
                    professional work in summer theater.</p>
                <p>I dropped it all when my husband came back. We traveled again all around the
                    United States. An interesting life. I had two children. Then we went to Europe
                    and lived in Munich and Paris. Again wonderful exposure. Of course I studied the
                    languages when there and entered into the life of the country. Our children went
                    to French school rather than the American School which was a great adventure for
                    them and good for their language. Then my husband went off to a hardship tour to
                    Iran and at that point...I am skipping over a great many years here because we
                    were married for 30 years. At a point where we came back to Washington I started
                    a radio program here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: This was about 1956. I decided that it was time for me to work. The
                    children were in school. I wanted to be home when they came home, but I wanted
                    to do part time work so we could do a little more opera, get ready for school
                    and save for education for them. In those days you didn't make a great deal of
                    money in the Army and it was important to augment the income. I was really a
                    pioneer. I didn't realize at the time that I was going to be called, later, a
                    pioneer. But Army wives did not work. Wives did not work. I would have women
                    coming up to me saying, “Oh, we envy you. I wish our husbands would let us
                    work.”</p>
                <p>So suddenly came new exposure to the professional world. I had really done it not
                    for gratification but because I wanted an increase in the income. That was the
                    original motivation. I was not frustrated with the life that I had had. It had
                    been fascinating all the way along.I did a program in Washington for about three
                    years and then I did television...educational television programs. I was host of
                    several shows. It was with WETA.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Then when my husband went on a hardship tour I went back to Munich where I had
                    the offer of an apartment. I worked for NBC Monitor. They approached me saying
                    they knew of my work and would I do some things for them in Europe. It turned
                    out that I did not only Europe, but they sent me to the Soviet Union, which was
                    an extremely interesting place to do interviews. At that time there was quite a
                    barrier between the press and the officials in the Soviet Union. But they were
                    able to get me in because in Moscow they wanted to start for the first time,
                    this was 1960-61, to promote their tourism. For a short time they did and then
                    they cut it off later. They thought if I could come, perhaps this would help
                    tell about different places in the Soviet Union and places people could see. So
                    I went to schools, hospitals, all kinds of places in Kiev, Moscow and Leningrad.
                    I also went to Poland and Hungary on that trip. I told a little about the
                    ballet, the Bolshoi, their schools, museums, etc. - a little bit about
                    everything that they were doing in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I did while I was in Munich, the children were going to
                    German school, was go to Radio Free Europe and do stories about what they were
                    doing. Radio Liberty was also in Munich but they were not open at all at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain a little for the historical record what Radio Free
                        Europe and Radio Liberty were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Radio Free Europe was broadcasting to what were then the Iron Curtain
                    countries...Eastern Europe... Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
                    Bulgaria. Radio Liberty, at the time, was broadcasting just to the Soviet Union.
                    The other countries were the Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. In
                    later years Radio Free Europe was joined with Radio Liberty. They broadcast no
                    English, and that is still true today. Radio Liberty broadcasts in the 12
                    languages of the Soviet Union. The Radio Free Europe part was all in the
                    languages of the countries to which they broadcast.</p>
                <p>Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty also were surrogate stations, which means
                    that they were the stations of the countries to which they broadcast, unlike the
                    Voice of America which tells more about the United States and something about
                    world news and some regional broadcasting. But the mission of Radio Free Europe
                    and Radio Liberty was really to be involved with the politics, the analysis,
                    keeping the culture alive of the target country. That is true today even with
                    the collapse of the Soviet Union. Radio Liberty is still, for the listener, a
                    non-governmental home station. There isn't the money in these countries to keep
                    the press as alive as they want it. The freedom is there to a certain
                    extent...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record you were working here for Radio Free Europe
                        and Radio Liberty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Well, no, here...I am now, but I will tell you about Voice of America just
                    briefly when I started with them, but I am now with Radio Free Europe and Radio
                    Liberty. This makes it so interesting that in those days in Munich I was telling
                    about them on U.S. radio. Actually they briefed me in Radio Free Europe before I
                    went into the Soviet Union and I came back and debriefed them of certain things
                    I had observed and which they had hoped I would take a look at while I was
                    there. Changes in the way people lived, etc. Nothing secret or clandestine. Just
                    a good look at events going on as I saw them.</p>
                <p>When I came back to the United States I had a call from Voice of America. I had
                    been working, of course, for NBC abroad. My husband came home and we came back
                    here. Voice of America asked if I would be interested in working for them here
                    in Washington, which I started to do. I was with them under contract for several
                    years before going on staff. I went on staff in 1968 and then in 1969 Mrs. Nixon
                    asked me to come to the White House and work for her. Actually I was originally
                    on her press staff but ended up doing work for her separately on several
                    things.</p>
                <p>I traveled with her around the world and with the President after the Moon Walk.
                    It was a wonderful time to go because the world was very open...it was the “trip
                    for peace” that President Nixon made. There, again, I was learning all the time.
                    To me learning is probably the most exciting part of being alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the foreign affairs field, on these trips with Mrs.
                        Nixon, how well was she briefed, interested and interacted with foreign
                        leaders and people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Let me tell you about her. By the time she went to Africa, I was no longer
                    on her staff because I had been on loan to the White House and had gone back to
                    VOA. But she asked me to come with her to Africa, knowing I had a little French
                    and she wanted me to help out a little bit. I went on the African trip where
                    President Nixon did not come, but she was there representing him. She was
                    outstanding, even giving the toasts at dinners we went to. We went to Liberia
                    for the inauguration of the President. We went to Ghana, Nigeria and the Ivory
                    Coast. Many of the press people from Newsweek, Time, and U.S. News &amp; World
                    Report had come from London to cover this event. She gave a press conference. I
                    remember, I think it was the Newsweek man who said to me, “Is she always like
                    this? We didn't know she could handle press or knew about affairs of state at
                    all.” I said, “Oh, she knows but she believes in falling back when her husband
                    is there and just being the housewife, first lady, and not interfering in
                    anything. But she really has come into her own on this trip because people have
                    seen what she can do.” And she was outstanding. And of course when one goes on a
                    trip with the President you have thorough briefing books of the political
                    situation in each country...what you are going to do and what your routine is
                    along with a thorough background of the country. So, there again, I had
                    remarkable White House experience which gave me a good viewpoint.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can understand the friendliness in most countries, but
                        how about Ghana? Was there a problem in Ghana? This was still the height of
                        Nkrumah wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I will tell you about Ghana. The beauty of Ghana was that they were so
                    polite that they held off on the coup until the day after we left. The
                    Ambassador from Ghana to the United States, of course, had accompanied Mrs.
                    Nixon from Washington to Ghana. I had known him and had met with him and his
                    wife before going over to Ghana to learn something about the country. He was
                    kept there. He couldn't get out. I came back and talked to his wife about the
                    fact that he was all right. I was the last person to have seen him. He did
                    weather the coup and became a minister. No, we didn't have trouble in Ghana. It
                    was a warm, wonderful welcome. In all of these countries there was a warm
                    welcome.</p>
                <p>Working at the White House was in itself a great exposure to understanding the
                    American system and that helped me later on when I was lecturing in various
                    parts of the world about the socio-economic conditions in this country and
                    answering questions. Although I am by no means an expert, I was able to give
                    information and do research before going. It was an AMPART grant that I had in
                    later years, in the '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that when you were in the Nixon
                        White House that here was an Administration that was operating with a real
                        plan as far as how foreign affairs will be conducted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Oh yes. I think it was well organized. I think President Nixon was
                    certainly one of our most brilliant presidents. He was a student of history. He
                    knew his history. He cared very much about the world. He also paid attention to
                    domestic affairs and did things that only come out now gradually. He had good
                    relations with Congress except for John Ehrlichman and Haldeman who ruffled
                    feathers. He was not a pat-on-the-back popular President because he was an
                    introvert, from my point of view. But so bright, so kind to the staff. He was a
                    pleasure to work for, we all loved him. He knew everybody's name. There was a
                    great warmth when he was on a one-on-one basis. The press was never with him. I
                    don't think the press caused his troubles, but they weren't with him when he
                    really needed friends. I have been pleased to see him act the way he has in the
                    ensuing years after Watergate and come back as a statesman. Of course Presidents
                    do pay attention to him, they do consult him. I think that is very good for this
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now leaving the White House, you were with the Voice of
                        America about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LYNCH: About 1970 then until I left in 1986. I traveled all over the United
                    States. I traveled in the '80s China. Radio Beijing, the government station
                    asked me to come and visit them in China. Now this was a great honor because
                    they had had some Chinese broadcasters go over from VOA, but they had never had
                    an American broadcaster come over as the guest of the government. This was, of
                    course, after the Cultural Revolution, but not so far afterwards. They were
                    still sorting things out. They still kept things very close.</p>
                <p>I remember going to the Chinese Embassy here and how amazing it was even to get
                    into the Embassy. It was hard to get through the doors. I remember too that when
                    I was telephoned about coming, it was by a Chinese professor who said, “We must
                    know before we extend it whether you will accept it.” Saving face was very
                    important. They asked me what I would like to do and I wanted to interview
                    people, of course, on all levels...in government, in banking, on farms,
                    music.</p>
                <p>I remember going to the music school where they had never had anyone come. Later
                    the First Lady went and they had her visit. I went to Beijing, the university. I
                    was also invited to lecture because the professor who had come here early on
                    said they used our VOA program to teach English and learn about America. I was
                    asked to lecture at the University of Nanjing, for example. It was a remarkable
                    trip. A wonderful trip going off, at that point, into the great unknown.</p>
                <p>I was assigned a political writer from Radio Beijing to go with me to Nanjing and
                    Shanghai and Xian and Hangzhou, Shanghai. Of course, when I asked to do anything
                    extra there was great consternation, many meetings. In each city my interpreter
                    companion and I were met with a car and a driver and also a representative of
                    that city who would be our man to answer questions. Actually my interpreter, the
                    one who was a political analyst, had been in the Red Guard she told me after we
                    had gotten to know each other a little bit better. She was also able to take me
                    into her apartment to meet her husband and see her little boy who had to be in
                    boarding school because she was assigned to Radio Beijing.</p>
                <p>The people at the Embassy told me that I was very fortunate to go into not only
                    her apartment, but one or two others that I was invited into. I was also invited
                    into the one that was very much for the VIPs. The Ambassador, Art Hummel, told
                    me that they rarely get into homes so I was fortunate to be doing it.</p>
                <p>I did interviews. At one time the interpreter said, “Well you are not going to be
                    able to use all these interviews. Where are you going to have them?” I said,
                    “Oh, I will use them.” And I did. They were all on my program, over several
                    weeks, sent around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your program once you got your place in VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LYNCH: It was called the “Breakfast Show.” Later it was called the “Morning Show”
                    which it is today. The “Breakfast Show” went on for years and years. It was
                    different. It was a microcosm of the VOA, because we had everything on
                    there...mostly interviews, some music. It covered American industry, theater,
                    cultural events, science matters. There were interviews - I did almost all of
                    the ones on my program on education, on events like civil rights and the strike.
                    I would talk about the march in Selma and what was going on here in Washington
                    in ways of conferences and how people were trying to get to know each other and
                    work things out. It was a history of this country.</p>
                <p>I found it very helpful to know about other countries because then I knew my
                    audience and their feelings, something about their sensitivities, I guess you
                    would say. Because of that I think I was helped to make friends with the people
                    who were listening. They were not fans as much as they were friends. For years
                    and years I did this first with two men and then just two of us...a man and I
                    did it on separate days. We had for many years the highest rating of any program
                    on the VOA.</p>
                <p>I remember that used to baffle some because of the personal aspects of it. They
                    would say, “Why is this a higher rating than our Meet the Press type things?”
                    Well, I think it was because we really contacted people. I told, for example,
                    about my children as they were growing up. They grew up on the “Breakfast Show.”
                    I didn't tell about it as a bragging mother but for a reason and the listeners
                    knew what the reason was. I would say that my son was getting ready to go to
                    college and we were going around visiting all the different universities to see
                    which one he wants and it is very difficult to get in but it is possible and
                    this is what we are doing.</p>
                <p>I remember when my daughter graduated and went to live in a little apartment I
                    told how she paid rent, bought a car on installment. The important thing was
                    that it was possible for a young person to have an apartment of her own and to
                    be able to buy a car.</p>
                <p>Then I talked about buying a house and how difficult it was. You didn't really
                    own the house for a long while because of the mortgage. All of these personal
                    things that were interspersed were for a reason. When the children were married
                    I told about the customs of wedding ceremonies in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a program like this did you feel any pressures
                        ...there were various Administrations in and out? Could you talk a little
                        about this? The VOA is an important element of our foreign affairs apparatus
                        and how here on a program that would seem to be pushing no foreign affairs
                        policy did you get pressures to lay off this or that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LYNCH: No, the freedom was extraordinary. I always said that I had the best job
                    of any woman (and at that point I qualified as “a woman”) in the United States
                    because I produced the program. Although I was on every other day, I had the
                    long two-hour Sunday program. Our program was the only VOA program where the
                    hosts were allowed to ad lib. Naturally if we said something that was really
                    stupid we wouldn't have had this trust. But it was a wonderful feeling to be
                    able to put in something that was a genuine feeling and people picked up on
                    this. We had letters from some ministers in other countries that said they
                    really believed what was said when Pat says it. I thought that was highly
                    complimentary. It wasn't so good if they weren't believing everything because on
                    the VOA we really build credibility. That is what is so important. I think
                    perhaps that was my main thought always...I want people to know that I am
                    telling the truth and I will poke a little fun at what isn't ideal, or what is
                    frustrating like tax collection time rather than that everything is rosy and
                    perfect. But all of VOA tries to do that. It is just that I had the chance to do
                    it on a personal basis and evidently it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get the feeling and get much response
                        for...here you were at a time of tremendous revolution about the role of
                        women in the American society. This was not the lot of many women who were
                        continuing to fight their way up. Were you able through your interviews to
                        bring out all this as well as the black and Hispanic experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Yes, without being a women's program I had a special and personal interest
                    in telling what was happening to women in this country. Let me give you a little
                    aside when you said that it was an interesting time. I remember the day, and
                    government certainly was a leader in accepting women in the working place and
                    making it fair for them, when I very politely said to my supervisor, “I really
                    think that it is time for me to have a promotion because I am doing exactly the
                    same thing that my male counterpart is doing, but I am making thousands of
                    dollars less.” He said, “Well, I agree but we have to go a little higher up.” We
                    went a little higher up and they said, “Well, we are sorry. Yes it is true you
                    are doing the same thing and a fine job, but we can't give you any more money
                    while we have men who have families to raise. They must have the promotions
                    first.” I thought that was extremely interesting and frustrating.</p>
                <p>I was not the type of woman who would sue or march, but, I have discussed this
                    with some rather high ranking women in government and we have all decided that,
                    although we weren't the kind that were pushing, we certainly are the
                    beneficiaries of the women who worked very hard out in the shouting arena, which
                    we didn't believe in because we were making slow and steady progress. I admire
                    those women because they opened the path for many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the usual course of revolutions. You have two
                        groups, one of the steady workers and the other out in front.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LYNCH: That's right. I think you need both and I think you need women helping
                    women. That is what I have always felt very strongly. If there is a chance to
                    promote a woman, or bring her along, that is very important for women who have
                    been able to forge ahead to reach out and help other women. That is a must and
                    you will see as we talk later on about my becoming an ambassador, I had a DCM
                    who was a woman - an extremely capable Black woman, Marilyn Hulbert - and as far
                    as we know we were the first embassy ever in the Foreign Service to be headed by
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has also been one of the stumbling blocks about the
                        ambassador and DCM relationships. You really shouldn't have two women
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I think we blasted that theory a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the ambassadorship, what about your
                        listener response? Were you finding particular responses from any particular
                        part of the world? Were more women responding to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: No, and I want to get back to one of your questions about what I did on
                    the air about women. I think perhaps I had more male listeners than female. I
                    will give you some examples of that. During International Women's Year, it was
                    the early '70s...the United Nations International Women's Year...I decided that
                    I would do something with my listeners about women, not just in this country but
                    all over the world. I asked listeners to write in a nomination for an
                    outstanding woman in their village, their city or their country or any other
                    country. I had a committee...I remember Vanetta Washington, the wife of the
                    mayor in Washington, and other people in this city outside of VOA were on the
                    committee. I said that we would choose three letters a week that I would read on
                    the air. The nominated woman would receive an International Women's Year pin as
                    would the person who did the nominating.</p>
                <p>Well the letters just poured in. More from men than from women, which I found
                    very exciting. The woman nominated might be a teacher in the village; someone
                    who had helped build a well; Mother Teresa, who received more nominations than
                    anyone, and I sent her a pin and letter; several people nominated a Japanese
                    mountain climber; people from all different parts of the world. It was exciting
                    because the letters did come in and you started to have a sense of more
                    appreciation for women because people stopped and thought about it.</p>
                <p>I did another year on volunteers which is really more of an American concept than
                    in other parts of the world. People wrote in about the volunteer they nominated.
                    These were just experiments and things I enjoyed doing very much.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But, no, I had, for example...many scientists would write and say that they were
                    always glad when I talked about scientific developments because they didn't get
                    much of that. Someone I know well today, was a physicist from Leningrad who
                    phoned me and said, “I have come to the United States and am working at Catholic
                    University and I would like to meet you. I came out with two suitcases.” He came
                    out on what was then one of the rare Jewish visas. He came with his wife and two
                    children and two suitcases through Vienna. I remember he had brought me a little
                    bowl, an enamel cup. He came over to my office and said, “Everything I have
                    learned about America I have learned on your program.” Just then the phone rang
                    and it was Clement Conger, the curator at the White House and the Department of
                    State. We talked for a minute and then the scientist said, “Oh, I know the name
                    Clement Conger, in America you can give gifts to him for your White House or
                    State Department that will come off your income tax.” I said, “You really did
                    listen carefully.” I had interviewed Clement Conger several times.</p>
                <p>I am telling you these things not to say how well I did in interviews, but about
                    the responses. This scientist was a member of the Academy of Sciences in the
                    Soviet Union. He said, “What I like the best about your interviews with
                    scientists was that I would be sitting there saying to myself, 'Oh, if only I
                    were there I would ask him about such and such,' and just then you would ask
                    him.” That made me feel very good because I hope that was true of all people
                    listening...that they would be getting their questions answered.</p>
                <p>I really felt strongly about my interviews being about the interviewee, not about
                    how much I knew. Naturally I had to do a great deal of homework ahead of time,
                    but I didn't want it to show, except from my questions. The interview was not to
                    be filled up with me, as it is today, but the person I wanted to bring out.</p>
                <p>My Soviet friend, for example...he is working today with General Electric...loves
                    this country. But as he said at the time it is a big adjustment. He said that he
                    was not starving in the Soviet Union because he had a good position, but there
                    was no future for his children. He wanted his son to go to MIT, which he did,
                    and my physicist is doing research at General Electric.</p>
                <p>I met some remarkable people through the years because of the Voice of America
                    program. I feel that it really was a tremendous privilege to have that
                    microphone and to be able to talk to people everywhere and have their letters
                    come in telling about what was happening in their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not have pressures from above to push this or that
                        a little harder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: No. I did not have censorship. As a matter of fact they always seemed
                    rather pleased with what I was doing. I would interview Congressmen, Senators,
                    Vice Presidents, Presidents, farmers in South Dakota...never just the hierarchy
                    but every walk of life. No, I was never censored or pushed.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There was a short time in the '80s when things were being revised. Every time we
                    had a change of administration I saw new people coming in. It is the same in
                    every profession I think...it is a bit harrowing when you have a whole new group
                    come in and they decide to take over. I remember the only people we really
                    objected to, we being broadcasters and personnel of VOA, would be a new man who
                    would stand up and say, “Now I am going to get some really professional people
                    in here to run the Voice of America.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously a man of great sensitivity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I remember we had one...these were not always the head they would maybe be
                    the deputy...new program director who said, “Now we don't think the people in
                    the rest of the world really care about the space program anymore.” Well, I knew
                    from my program...I had several features that were weekly, steady things and one
                    was the space program. A man from NASA came and people wrote in questions. It
                    was our most popular feature, no question about it. I always considered the
                    reason I had so much mail was because the space things came in, not just because
                    they seemed to like the program, which they did. We did a labor program with a
                    labor expert. We talked about GATT for ever and ever with the business
                    broadcaster. I would read a letter a listener sent in and then we would discuss
                    it in detail. We had agriculture because there were people wondering about our
                    advances in agriculture. That wouldn't always be as exciting to American
                    listeners. Why are you talking about fertilizer? Well we weren't broadcasting
                    for American listeners, although we were delighted when they tuned in.</p>
                <p>This was some of my grounding, the whole VOA experience, in foreign affairs. I
                    remember Nancy Kassebaum coming up to me just before the confirmation process on
                    the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She is Senator from Kansas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: From Kansas and very much interested in Africa where I was going. She was
                    on the committee for the confirmation hearings. She came up to me and said, “I
                    am so glad to have someone who has the experience that you have as a non-career
                    foreign service person.” I heaved a great sigh of relief because appearing
                    before Congress is always enough to make you a little apprehensive ahead of
                    time. I felt that was very nice of her to put me at ease before she went up and
                    took her seat. It was a help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's turn to the main focus now. How was your
                        appointment to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands? You served there from 1986
                        to 1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LYNCH: That is right, just a little over three years. Well, people had often said
                    at VOA...especially after my trip to China and when I went out on a speaking
                    grant. (One country I went to was the Philippines and it was having a very
                    difficult time, I might say, when they were having riots before the fall of
                    Marcos. I had been in the Philippines before with the Nixons.) Well, I was often
                    referred to as an ambassador for the United States because of the programs and
                    travels. The term had come into being, but not in my wildest dreams did I ever
                    have it as a goal because it was not my career path.</p>
                <p>However, thinking back to the International Women's Year, I remember that the
                    woman who was the head of that, Ruth Bacon, was a retired Foreign Service
                    officer. After we had worked together in that year she said to me, “You know you
                    should be an ambassador. You know that don't you?” I said, “No, I never thought
                    of it.” She said, “Well, you should be but you will never be because you are a
                    woman. I reached the deputy level.” I tried very hard to call her at the time I
                    knew that I could tell people about it and she had just died. I remember being
                    so sad. I hadn't seen her for several years and I had wanted to tell her that
                    women had really progressed to the point where amazing things could happen.</p>
                <p>So I think it all happened because a number of people came together at the same
                    time with the idea. And, you don't, as we all know, have special things happen
                    in this world unless others help you. In this case there were two things. One, I
                    had worked for the government. I certainly couldn't help on any campaign and I
                    never had given any money so to be a political ambassador those are usually
                    things that make the path rather quick. I had served many Presidents of all
                    parties very gladly without any feeling of whether I was a Democrat or a
                    Republican. It didn't make any difference what our VOA people were either, or
                    USIA heads, whether they were Democrats or Republicans. When you work for the
                    government you don't ordinarily have political allegiances, at least I didn't,
                    because I felt the important thing I was selling was the United States.</p>
                <p>So people wrote letters, not at my instigation, I might add. A wonderful man I
                    did know well, by the name of Arthur Burns, I would say probably started it. He
                    was, of course, head of the Federal Reserve, became Ambassador to Germany, and
                    was one of our most highly thought of ambassadors. He thought I should become an
                    ambassador and he wrote a letter to the head of USIA and it went to the White
                    House. I had some interviews...all of this took quite a while, it doesn't happen
                    overnight. But over the course of a year or more different things happened. I
                    also had something rather nice happen in that the man who was the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs had said to me that they would certainly be glad
                    to have me if my name did come in from the White House because of my background.
                    But, I still knew it was a very difficult process and I didn't count on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So it actually came to pass. The White House proposed me for two countries, Ghana
                    and Madagascar. Then I had the call from the White House saying that the
                    President was sending my name to be Ambassador to Madagascar and the Comoros,
                    which was a smaller country near by. Madagascar, itself, has 12 million people
                    and is one of the larger spots. But the Comoros were also important to us
                    because of its location. Now it is a separate embassy. At that time it was part
                    of the Madagascar Ambassador's responsibilities.</p>
                <p>I remember that from the time the White House proposed me...it was not public,
                    this had to be kept very quiet...but I went over to the Department of State and
                    thought I could continue my program and also be learning about Madagascar. But I
                    found in the matter of just a couple of weeks that I really couldn't do a good
                    job of preparation unless I gave it my fullest attention. So I told one or two
                    people it was necessary to tell at VOA that I was going to be on temporary duty
                    and that is the way we said it on the air. I was just off on a temporary
                    assignment and I would be back. And I was back for my final program just a week
                    or so before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you announce what you were going to do and how one
                        prepares to become an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I did a whole program about my becoming an Ambassador but not on how one
                    prepares to be one. I did tell them a little bit about Madagascar and where it
                    was, what its exports were, a little bit about it. I received right at the
                    Embassy about a hundred letters a year coming in from people all over the world
                    who had heard the last program and just wanted to touch base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you prepare to be an Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I spent time at the Department of State in the African Bureau, in
                    particular the East African Branch. I studied. I read cables. The big part was
                    interviews. Probably as many as sixty. Constantly having consultation with
                    people in the Department of State on numerous subjects. Then consultations with
                    the various agencies I would be working with...AID, the intelligence people, the
                    Pentagon, etc.</p>
                <p>The aim was to get to know the people you would be working with from afar and
                    also so that you would learn yourself the mission of AID, for example. That was
                    always an interesting one for me, the Agency for International Development. I
                    had heard that in many Embassies it was a great bone of contention between the
                    Ambassador and the AID director. There was bad feeling. I said to myself that it
                    was not going to be that way if I could help it where I am going. I learned on
                    the scene that the AID people help an Ambassador with the mission. The AID
                    people have the money you want to have to help an emerging country with
                    difficulties. You want to be able to help them build a hydroelectric plant or
                    help with their banking system, as part of your mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I had extremely good fortune because perhaps with all my good intentions if I
                    hadn't had the two directors I had from AID it wouldn't have worked as well as
                    it did. In the first instance I had a wonderful man who had a very small staff.
                    His wife also worked. We worked together just perfectly and accomplished, I
                    think, a great deal. Well, testimony to what happened later, we did accomplish a
                    great deal. He had been there three or four years and was reassigned. Someone
                    new came out. I thought, oh, I have lost this wonderful man and it will never be
                    quite the same. And along came an equally wonderful man. So I was very lucky on
                    that. We worked just as well together as the first one and I had worked.</p>
                <p>AID was so pleased in Washington that they decided to make Madagascar a real
                    showcase. The consequence of that was that just before I was leaving AID started
                    to build it up to enormous (relatively speaking) proportions. I disagreed with
                    that because I think it works better in a smaller country on a smaller scale.
                    The first thing you know you have logistical problems, two administrative
                    officers competing for housing space in the same city. I understand that
                    problems have arisen because of the large staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Small countries can't take it. We tend to come in and take
                        over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I am giving you my frank opinion. On a platform I would support AID to the
                    hilt because I believe very strongly in what they are doing and I think they
                    have very good people. But as in all instances, the bureaucracy is apt to...the
                    tail wags the dog. I think that can happen when things build up too much.</p>
                <p>Now in my Embassy, when I arrived we had too small a staff and we doubled it
                    while I was there, but only because that was the way State wanted it, and they
                    understood our needs. We needed a political officer very badly and didn't have
                    one. A good one came in. We needed a good economic officer. The staff was built
                    up to be a very fine one. It isn't the most important place in the world, but
                    for its size of 12 million people, and its strategic spot off the east coast of
                    Africa and with the straits running by and with possible troubles in South
                    Africa and perhaps tankers having to come up our way, it is important to have it
                    do well.</p>
                <p>Also there was a very strong Soviet influence there and I think that is one of
                    the main reasons we wanted it to be a good working embassy.</p>
                <p>It is a wonderful job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out what were your implicit or explicit
                        instructions? What were American interests in Madagascar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Economic interests were almost at a standstill because it was a Marxist
                    oriented government. Everything had been nationalized. American firms had had to
                    pull out. AMOCO, the oil company, was there, but that was the only big
                    enterprise at that point. One of the things that I interpreted I was to do was
                    to lay the groundwork for future investment. We did a great deal of that. We
                    tried to interest people in this country, I talked endlessly to the President of
                    Madagascar about a new investment code. He said that he had one and why did he
                    need another one. I said, “You need a new one because the one you have isn't
                    good enough. You are not going to attract people until you give them some
                    profit. You can't keep the 51%.” He would say that I sounded like the French.
                    The French and the Americans and the Soviet were the big influences there.</p>
                <p>So I did a great deal with the President trying to improve the investment code
                    and improve his attitude towards the United States which was not very good when
                    I went out. I had very good relations with the President. I admired him for his
                    intelligence...”admire,” he is still alive. The other President, the one in the
                    Comoros, was assassinated right after I left. President Ratsiraka, in
                    Madagascar, was attracted, in his youth, to the communist system, having gone to
                    university in Paris. He went into the French navy and became a captain. He
                    promoted himself to admiral after he became President. This is a man of great
                    intelligence. I was always sorry that he wasn't more oriented towards us. I
                    think one of my chief jobs was to orient him more in our direction. During my
                    tour, conditions were good with him and the ministers, I think they were
                    improved. So I felt good about that. You can't make massive changes but I had
                    helped a little bit for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation when you arrived? Was it
                        a one party situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Pretty much a one party system. The President starting loosening up to
                    where he said he wanted it to be a democracy. You see, our strength started to
                    become obvious in those years...I must say that President Reagan could never
                    have enough credit for building up the defense because I think, taking just
                    Madagascar, the President of Madagascar after Vietnam had written us off as
                    weak. The Soviets were the people he should hitch his wagon to because he felt
                    the Soviets were stronger. He had his limited military equipment from them. As
                    we became stronger he had more respect for us. So I went in at a good time to
                    help further relations because I had the backing of this superpower that he was
                    beginning to have more respect for than he had had in the past, even though he
                    still ranted and raved about what the United States had done to him.</p>
                <p>The day I presented my credentials he went on and on, not on the television part,
                    about all these awful things that America had done to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had we done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>LYNCH: We had corrupted his students, we had done things with our ships that we
                    shouldn't have done, just all kinds of things. I knew what some of the basis of
                    his charges were, they were not good charges at all. This was in front of his
                    staff and a couple of my staff. After that, I always met with him face to face
                    with no interpreter, no staff, because that was the way the relationship could
                    build the best. I liked him. I didn't agree with him and I told him and this was
                    really the foundation of our relationship.</p>
                <p>Early on I said that I would start with a new beginning and I knew all these
                    things he was feeling strongly about. I said that I would start with a clean
                    slate and we would start from here. I said that I wouldn't always agree with
                    him, but I would respect his view. He liked that attitude. He was a very strong
                    man with a big ego. He liked that I would speak up.</p>
                <p>I remember that someone told me in the Department before I left that this man was
                    probably going to be very condescending to me because I was a woman. That wasn't
                    the case at all. I always felt he treated me exactly the same as he would have
                    treated a male ambassador.</p>
                <p>A little anecdote, what I did for my country. He smoked long Cuban cigars and I
                    am allergic to cigarette smoke much less the cigar smoke. The purer our air
                    becomes the more allergic I am. I sat on one side of his desk and the cigar
                    smoke would come pouring out. My anecdote is that one day he stopped to answer
                    the phone. He put his cigar in the ashtray and it all came right at me and I
                    started to sneeze. I sneezed all the way through his phone call. I managed to
                    pull out of the sneezing session when he returned and picked up his cigar. The
                    next time I went to his office he said, “How are you? When you were here last
                    time you had a terrible cold.”</p>
                <p>A couple of years later a government official came for the inauguration. A man
                    this time from the Department, a deputy assistant secretary, and he said to me,
                    “Oh, I was so worried because I didn't think I could get through my speech
                    because I am so allergic to tobacco and he pulled out a cigar and I thought I
                    was going to sneeze.” So it wasn't just a female thing!</p>
                <p>We had a program called Food for Progress and it was wonderful. The Ambassador
                    just before me had laid the groundwork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador just before you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Robert Keating. Life is such that one Ambassador sets up something and the
                    next one takes the credit for it. I like to say I really received credit for our
                    big import of rice coming in. It all went well and it really started the economy
                    on a new turn. But it is because the Ambassador just before me had really
                    organized the program, had set it up and had it all ready to roll, and I came in
                    and made it roll. I hope the efforts I made helped the next Ambassador who came
                    in. That is the way it goes in the Foreign Service, as you know. One sets it up
                    and the next one gets the credit. But that is all right because it passes on and
                    all turns out even in the end.</p>
                <p>The economy was in terrible shape in Madagascar. The farmer wouldn't grow rice
                    because he wouldn't make any money. People couldn't buy because the price of
                    rice was too high. We brought in rice to go into government silos. The black
                    market was buying up all the rice and would release it around Christmas time. We
                    brought in tons of rice and the government had to keep it until Christmas time
                    and then release it and sell it at a price that we set with the World Bank. Then
                    the black market was left holding its silos with their rice. This worked because
                    suddenly the people had enough rice when what we had brought in was being
                    released. The farmer by the time I left was starting to grow more rice because
                    he was getting a better price for it in the marketplace. It was the old wheel
                    starting to turn, but ever so gently. It never really took off. But there were
                    many more goods in the stores than when I had arrived. It was starting.</p>
                <p>And now the tragedy of Africa and of small countries is that there have been
                    riots, not a coup, because the President still is in partial power...he is in
                    his Palace with 2,000 guards and the rest of the government has been taken over
                    by opposing sides. There is a new Prime Minister and all Cabinet members are
                    new. The President is ruling with the new people but everything is at a
                    standstill. All the investment that the Ambassador who had followed me had very
                    carefully set up...he was going to have people come over from the Overseas
                    Investment Corporation...all had to be canceled because of a strike. The strike
                    has been going on from this point for more than six months. But things are
                    starting to roll again. The mails are starting to work better. The planes are
                    starting to fly better internally.</p>
                <p>I am always hopeful that there will be a great turn around because you have very
                    intelligent people, the Malagasy are extremely intelligent. They are
                    industrious. They have vanilla and coffee and minerals. The markets are low now,
                    but they have the wherewithal and they have skills. This country can be very
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are basically of Malaysian stock aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Yes they are. They are more Asian than African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is their orientation? Do they look towards
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LYNCH: Not really. It is amazing. I didn't know until I arrived there how little
                    they looked toward Africa. They don't consider themselves African. Now they do
                    send people to conferences there. The President had hopes of being very
                    important in the Organization of African States, but he didn't make president of
                    it. There were no ambassadors there from African countries when I first arrived,
                    although there were 20 or so embassies from Eastern Europe, Iran, Great Britain,
                    France, the Soviet Union, etc. It was rather a large diplomatic community
                    because they all figured it was a rather important place to send someone. But
                    Africa, no.</p>
                <p>The people are very Asian in their thinking and looks. Their rice paddies
                    reminded me of Nepal when I first arrived, with all the terraces. The look of
                    the country is very much like Nepal. These are wonderful people. Really lovely.
                    Very passive people, but they can be aroused and then can be angry, in fights
                    between themselves, cut off heads if necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old Malaya business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: That's right. But basically they will absorb a great deal of hardship
                    without complaining. The FSNs were fine people to work with and outstanding. We
                    had a great many of them and without them an embassy couldn't run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were competing with the Soviets there. This was sort of
                        at the end of Soviet influence overseas, things starting collapsing around
                        1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Yes, that is right. Let's even take it to late 1988. When was the first
                    summit here in Washington? I believe that was December 7, 1988, if I remember
                    properly. Among the many things that an ambassador does, one reason it makes it
                    such an interesting job is that you are operating on so many different levels
                    all the time. You have the political level which is all important. You have
                    running the Embassy. You have your relationships with the different agencies.
                    And then you have the entertaining. I did a great deal of that also. I had a
                    beautiful residence and an outstanding household staff. I did a great deal of
                    entertaining, always with the Malagasy. And also I liked to have the Embassy
                    people there. Then I would integrate the Embassy people with the Malagasy.</p>
                <p>Then I was interested in the wildlife there...the preservation there...because
                    the burning of the forests and the danger of the lemur, a unique animal,
                    becoming extinct. I always had World Wildlife people come to dinner when they
                    were visiting from the United States, or from anywhere. I would have people from
                    the Ministry of Scientific Affairs come...not just ministries, but many people
                    from the university.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I worked very closely with the university. My next door neighbor was the
                    President...not in the beginning, he was the head of the law school. He became
                    one of my closest friends in Madagascar. The university, of course, politically,
                    was very important, because that is where your riots start. The marching
                    students brought down the government in 1975 and when I was there we had a
                    couple of very bad times when it looked as if the government might be
                    overthrown. My concern was for the Embassy personnel. The students were not
                    against the United States. As a matter of fact, the Malagasy are very much
                    oriented towards the U.S. They love us. They are French, culturally.</p>
                <p>In my entertaining, I would sometimes include the Soviet Ambassador, and he would
                    come if it were a special dinner, for example. He would bring his interpreter.
                    He had a great many KGB in his embassy as Madagascar was a very important place
                    for the Soviets because of its location...in the Indian Ocean, etc. He would
                    come with his interpreter and I would talk with him, wherever we were. I would
                    talk to his interpreter in French and he would interpret to the ambassador in
                    Russian. We became rather adept at it. I always asked him if he would bring one
                    particular interpreter who spoke beautiful French rather than with a heavy
                    Russian accent, because I could then understand better. Never was I invited
                    back. This is an important point to show you the changing times. But always he
                    was very friendly and we would talk and I would go to the Soviet Embassy to sign
                    the book if there was an earthquake, any kind of national day, etc.</p>
                <p>But at the time of the first summit between the President and Gorbachev I invited
                    the Soviet Ambassador ...this was not something Washington said to do, but I
                    thought this was a good time to have the ambassador, with his wife, come to the
                    Embassy the morning of December 7. I had a bottle of champagne and some cakes
                    and I had my DCM sit in...she was also a very good political officer (as was the
                    designated political officer). He brought his political officer. I also had my
                    husband there because I thought it would be good to have the two spouses
                    there.(As it turned out, his wife did not come.) We had a nice talk. It wasn't
                    anything revolutionary but it was just a gesture I wanted to make because I
                    could see the rapport in Washington coming. It went very well. We toasted the
                    two Presidents.</p>
                <p>That same week, the day the summit was to be over here, he invited me to come to
                    his residence in the compound. Of course they were all living in a compound. It
                    was the first time, according to the other ambassadors, that a Western
                    ambassador had even gone into the compound. So that was a step.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Then we had a pianist...in the Arts in the Embassy program of sending over an
                    artistic ambassador type...coming and there was only one good piano and that was
                    in our residence. I was going to have the political people come to the house for
                    a special recital but also we wanted to give one for the overall international
                    and government structure. It was a revolutionary idea, but my USIA man, the PAO,
                    suggested to me...”Do you think it would be possible for us to ask the Soviets
                    and possibly use their piano and cultural center?” I thought this was a
                    wonderful idea. Their cultural center had an interesting location, it looked out
                    right on top of our Embassy and we know there were many unusual things going on
                    there besides cultural events. But I did ask and they said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>We gave a joint affair with our pianist and their piano and cultural center. I
                    had the invitations made up with the crest of the US Embassy and the crest of
                    the Soviet Embassy on it. They went out and people said they thought they would
                    never live to see the day. The Minister of Cultural Affairs, who was a very
                    pronounced communist, a woman...I always got on well with her but I told her I
                    didn't agree with her at all in her ideology, but I was glad to see a woman in
                    high places. She said no American Ambassador had ever called on her before. She
                    came to this event. From then on everything changed. She allowed us to use her
                    library for exhibits, which she never had before. It changed the whole
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a weakening in the zeal of the
                        French-inspired far left socialism as they started looking at the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Well, it was, but it was slow and subtle. The Soviet Ambassador after our
                    cultural affairs and our visits back and forth between residences...the next
                    thing was that he invited everyone for a sports day within the compound. This
                    was truly revolutionary. Then I had everybody for an American, western picnic at
                    the residence. It started to rain during the picnic and I remember inviting
                    everyone inside. The men, many of whom were obviously KGB, were astonished that
                    we would let them in our house. They just couldn't get over it. The Soviets were
                    much friendlier towards us but they did not lessen their subversive activity. I
                    don't want it to seem as if it did, and I am afraid sometimes people think all
                    the danger disappeared, because it didn't. It was good for us, though, to get to
                    know them better.</p>
                <p>But I must say that they used some of the contacts that we made in a way that we
                    had to be very wary of...because we were visiting back and forth and because
                    relations were better they were able to meet some of our FSNs more easily and
                    that is always dangerous ground. We were very much aware and alert to that fact.
                    And it was fascinating. The friendship forming on the top, but the old ways
                    continuing on the bottom.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the weakening in the ideology of the
                        Malagasy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Yes, I think disillusionment would be the word. The spare parts not
                    working. I left in September 1989 and the big fall didn't come until
                    November/December 1989. When the Wall came down and the Romanian revolution in
                    December 1989. This is when President Ratsiraka, again being an extremely
                    intelligent man, had to reassess things a little bit. He must have taken a good
                    look. I think he knows that things have changed. I think the people in the
                    country do and they want very much to have a free enterprise. They were pushing
                    hard for it when I was there. The President was going along with it. I must say
                    that President Ratsiraka was good about going along with the World Bank, the
                    IMF, and with our plans. That was important and why we supported him in election
                    time of the spring of 1989. He was making the effort. The problem was that he
                    was not making it fast enough for the people in his country who wanted private
                    enterprise, wanted to get the wheel turning, wanted to get food on the streets
                    for the poor, faster. I think for him it was difficult and he was dragging his
                    feet, but he was doing it, but not fast enough for his own country's
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your USIA operations? Were these going along
                        fairly well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Very well. I had good people from USIA, two people. A junior officer. We
                    had an acting PAO because I had taken away the chief one, Marilyn Hulbert, and
                    made her my DCM, and we could never get another one out there. They were always
                    due to come and something would happen. We did have two splendid acting ones.
                    One had to move on to Morocco and the new one who came was young, but
                    outstanding. So I was very fortunate on that. They had good press relations. The
                    press by the time I had arrived had opened up. Not that they didn't have
                    misinformation columns. The most difficult part, and I think this is true in
                    other countries that had their Marxist orientation...the radio was where you
                    would get your anti-West propaganda. Television was not so bad, but radio which
                    was always in Malagasy rather than French was where you would get your vitriolic
                    talk about Libya, Iran and things that were anti-West. We would try whatever we
                    could to set the misinformation straight. Things were going pretty well. We had
                    to go pick up the press for things we wanted them to cover because their
                    transportation just wasn't there. They would say, “Yes, we want to come,” and we
                    would go pick them up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it wasn't the situation you find in some countries
                        where you almost have to pay to get your stories into the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>LYNCH: No. I think through the years we had been building and when the President
                    started to ease up on us the press did too. They liked the people we brought in
                    from USIA, visiting scholars, arts, etc. We would get excellent press, wonderful
                    reviews when we would have speakers come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the African Bureau in
                        Washington, the Department of State, as far as support, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Well, they were the best. That was my impression and I heard this from
                    everybody in Africa. I have heard that it is better than any other Bureau for
                    support. We are so far out there, so removed. Even when budget problems were
                    pressing, if we presented our case properly, we would get help. If we really
                    needed something we would get it from the African Bureau. I felt in close
                    contact. Good desk officers. Just outstanding support. When I would come back
                    for briefings and debriefings, the African Bureau was right there solidly behind
                    me. There was never any feeling that I was political and they were regular.
                    There was just tremendous rapport. I was always relieved that they would say
                    that they heard I was doing very well...they would hear that from the Madagascar
                    Ambassador here and others. That was encouraging to me because I would come home
                    and they would tell me I was making relations better out there, etc. I tell you
                    that because I am so pleased that a political ambassador can be treated and
                    regarded as well as a Foreign Service officer. There is something to be said for
                    the infusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think any thinking Foreign Service officer feels that
                        way. It does bring in good solid new blood. When somebody comes in with no
                        qualifications and no interests, these are the horror stories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: For the most part that is not the case. Certainly a non-political officer
                    can stick his or her neck out a little more because you are not quite as
                    confined to the bureaucratic channel, if you are not unreasonable about it. I
                    think that is important too, that you can make changes that need doing and then
                    you can sell them to the Department and tell them why...back it up with facts.
                    Maybe you can do some things that you might not be able to do as a Foreign
                    Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Service is basically a practical bunch and if
                        your ambassador arrives and has clout, it really doesn't matter where they
                        come from. The clout is the important element.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Summing up this period as Ambassador, I wonder if you could tell us what gave you
                    the greatest satisfaction and what were some of the greatest
                    disappointments?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LYNCH: You remind me of a question that I was asked by Mike Armacost, somebody I
                    knew and admired so much. He was Under Secretary for Political Affairs when I
                    first went out. I saw him on my first trip back and we were talking in his
                    office. He said, “Pat, how do you like it?” I said, “Oh, I love it. It just
                    couldn't be a better job, more interesting place. I am so glad I am there.” He
                    said, “I knew you would. What is the most interesting part of it?” I said, “I
                    think it is the diversity. There is so much on so many different levels. You are
                    working with the people in the Embassy; you are working with people back in
                    Washington; you are working with the Malagasy; you are working with the
                    government, which is such a high priority. Everyday is different and a
                    challenge.”</p>
                <p>There were, of course, crises, but I don't mind them, I get very calm in a
                    crisis. I seem to do things almost on automatic pilot during such periods. So it
                    was the diversity. I like the challenge. To be truly happy you need to be
                    challenged to live up to your greatest potential. That is really happiness in a
                    job or in life when you can be taxed at every level of your potential and that
                    certainly is what comes with the job in an interesting country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything that you wished you could have done but
                        just couldn't get done there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: Oh, yes. I wish I could have done it before so that the second time I
                    would know everything to start with. But you don't, you certainly have to learn,
                    at least the first year, on the job no matter how much you have studied. I did a
                    lot of studying. The second year you know what you are doing and you can be
                    effective. The third year you are really geared up for it. I think three years
                    is probably right because you are working at top speed at high tension whether
                    one is conscious of it or not. If I had it to do again I would know so many
                    things. It would have been easier. I don't think I would have done it
                    differently, it just would have been easier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me just a bit about what you are up to
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LYNCH: I came back...I was fortunate because I was home five days when the
                    President of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty called me and said he would
                    like to talk to me. We met and he offered me the job of Director of Corporate
                    Affairs here in Washington. That was very good because I like Washington, know
                    people and have worked here for years and years. So I said yes, because I
                    believed in the mission of RFE/RL, which is a private corporation but it has a
                    great deal of independence as it is sponsored by a Board for International
                    Broadcasting which receives its funding from Congress. This gives us more
                    independence then VOA has. I believe in the mission which is to keep the free
                    flow of information going into the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries.
                    Today the mission is, we feel, just as important; those countries feel it is
                    just as important because now they are struggling to solidify a very fragile
                    democracy. And of course there are 15 new countries in the former Soviet Union
                    to which we broadcast (not in English at all) but already we broadcast in 12 of
                    those languages, Russian sufficing for the others. We are the only people in
                    place with all of those languages.</p>
                <p>So I went out of Africa into Eastern Europe at a time, late 1989, when everything
                    started to happen. Of course, I love to learn about new things and this has
                    exposed me to a great deal of information about what has been going on on the
                    former Soviet Union scene and these newly developing countries of Hungary,
                    Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and the three Baltic States of
                    Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</p>
                <p>I love it because it is never dull. There is always something happening. It is a
                    learning experience. I go to Munich about twice a year because Munich is our
                    head-quarters. Washington has a news bureau plus some language service desks. I
                    work very closely with the news bureau. The language service people I work with
                    a little more closely. We now have a new branch of the Research Institute here.
                    The Institute is something that we set up in Munich. So it is again a
                    multifaceted, not always tangible sort of assignment, but very, very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>I retired from the Foreign Service after I came back when I had the offer to come
                    here, because RFE/RL is a private corporation. I had had 21 years in government.
                    I retired with a small ceremony in the Director General's Office. Ed Perkins was
                    the Director General. He had been our Ambassador to South Africa and I had
                    visited him there. He presented me with the United States flag and the
                    Ambassador's flag as they do for out going ambassadors who are retiring. And
                    some kind words. I felt good about that because I think it is very important to
                    serve your country and I had a good 21 years, 26, 27 actually, and I wouldn't
                    trade it for all the money in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think you very much. I really appreciate
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LYNCH: I have enjoyed it. It is always good to talk about my career. Thank you
                    very much.</p>
