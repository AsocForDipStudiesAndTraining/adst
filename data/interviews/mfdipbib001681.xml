                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 25th of February, 2008. This is an interview
                        with Carl - middle initial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Middle name is Anthony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Bastinia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Bastiani, pronounced as in Italian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B-A-S-T-I-A-N-I. And the Carl is spelled with a “C.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That is correct. I was actually baptized “Carlo,” which is Charles in
                    Italian but my parents got bad advice from a neighbor about the English
                    equivalent, so I became Carl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And you go by Carl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start at the beginning. When and where were
                        you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, southwest side, on March 8,
                    1928.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. You were born in the year of the dragon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Is that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, because I was born in 1928 too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, let's start, get some background. Can you tell me
                        something about your family on your father's side first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: My father was an immigrant. He was born in Italy in 1892.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In the area called Ascoli Piceno. It is northeast of Rome on a national
                    highway, known as the Via Salaria since ancient Roman times. “Sal” means salt;
                    the Romans used to bring their salt from the Adriatic along that road. My father
                    immigrated into the United States in 1913. He went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
                    because he had a relative there, a sister married to a man named Monti. He was
                    trained as a coppersmith. Have seen those hammered copper pots from Italy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That was his trade. He had a little shop right on the Via Salaria in my
                    mother's home town, Acquasanta Terme. With this skill, he got a job with
                    National Casket Company in Pittsburgh making copper ornaments. He was drafted
                    into the American army, served in California but never went overseas. Through
                    his military service, he became an American citizen. Congress had passed a law
                    granting citizenship to aliens who had served in the U.S. army. Then he went
                    back to Italy with his stake, bought a three story house in the center of the
                    village of Acquasanta Terme - the name means holy water baths. There are mineral
                    baths in use since ancient Roman times in the Tronto river valley below the town
                    which is literally perched on the side of a mountain. There he married my mother
                    and brought her over in 1920. He intended to return, but never did. He died
                    young, at the age of 50, in 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of education did your father and mother
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Both my parents had the required minimum education in Italy at the
                    time, five years of elementary schooling; that is all. And while they grew up in
                    an area with a dialect, Marcheggiano, spoken in the region of Le Marche, they
                    learned the national language of Italy in school which is based on Tuscan, the
                    regional language of Tuscany where Florence is located. However, the
                    Marcheggiano dialect is very close to Tuscan.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the dialects - I was in Italy, I was in Naples at
                        one time - some of the dialects can be very far away from standard
                        Italian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They can be totally incomprehensible to anyone who learns standard
                    Italian. I had a maid in Naples and used to drive her and her friend who worked
                    for a colleague back to their homes at night after babysitting. They would carry
                    on a lively conversation in the back seat of the car. I never understood a
                    single word - not a single word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much from either your father or more probably
                        your mother, about life in the old country and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed I did. Not so much from my father because I was only 14 when he
                    died, but my mother was always telling us how things were done much better in
                    Italy. I got tired of hearing it. All I wanted to do as a child growing up was
                    identify with my environment, my American environment; I even preferred the, you
                    know, that mushy white American bread to the crispy crust bread that my mother
                    baked herself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonder Bread, as I think it was called then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I am one of six siblings and we kind of got tired of hearing her tales,
                    until she finally she returned to Italy for the first time in 1963 or 1964
                    during my first tour overseas in Naples. I took her up to her home town to see
                    her sisters - she was one of six sisters and an older brother; only one other
                    younger sister had immigrated to the United States. All of these sisters had
                    married and had families. I was amused to observe her lecturing them on how
                    things were done so much better in America. In fact it was that visit and,
                    formally, my application to enter the Foreign Service which finally made an
                    American of her. Earlier, when she learned that I had applied to the Foreign
                    Service she jumped through all the hoops to become a citizen, because she
                    thought that would help me accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you grew up in Philadelphia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pittsburgh. Did you grow up there as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Until the age of 14, yes. Until then I had never been farther than 75
                    miles away from home. I went to the local parochial school. My mother revered
                    the Church and education, and insisted on sending us to the parochial elementary
                    school, despite the family's limited income.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a bit about what your life was like as a
                        young kid there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I remember going to a public kindergarten briefly, because the
                    parish did not have a kindergarten. About all I remember of that experience is
                    the school's big red brick building which I survives to this day. I had two very
                    close friends; one was a cousin who lived across the street, another who lived
                    on the same street, of a family of German origin. We were crazy about sports,
                    especially softball, baseball, and football. Baseball was my favorite; I am
                    still an emotional Pittsburgh Pirate fan - in fact I used to get down on my
                    knees and pray for them to win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's your parochial education coming out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That certainly was part of it. We had pickup games all the time after
                    school. We walked downhill a mile to school and uphill a mile back, and my
                    mother, being a great believer in education, would accept no excuses for not
                    going to school. On really cold days she used to line us up and give us each a
                    spoon of anisette, which is a liqueur made from anise. The more commonly known
                    anise liqueur is the French Pernod which strikes me as less strong than the
                    Italian Meletti she dispensed, made in her own region of Le Marche. That would
                    really warm you up on its way down inside. And then, you know, if it was there
                    was snow we would have snowball fights, now and then with other “gangs.” We also
                    pretended to box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well boxing, of course, everybody followed the heavyweight
                        championship fights on the radio. Joe Louis was the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed, indeed. At that time we had Billy Conn from Pittsburgh; he was
                    a light heavyweight who challenged Louis for the heavy weight championship in
                    two bouts, but got knocked out in the first round or early round of the rematch.
                    Of course, we were really rooting for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get an idea about the neighborhood, how
                        would you classify the sort of the neighborhood in which you grew up? What
                        was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I would say working class. It was certainly not affluent, on the poor
                    side economically, although we lacked for nothing in terms of food. My father at
                    times used to walk five miles to work just to save some money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what we are talking about is that you were a child
                        of the Depression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No question about it. I was a child of the Depression that was still on
                    throughout my childhood. But we didn't think we were poor. Our days were full
                    and pleasurable. Between school, regular meals, listening to the radio, talking
                    sports, and playing pickup games, our days were full. We played tackle football
                    without a bit of equipment. We all had roller skates and bicycles. Helmets were
                    unknown and we somehow survived the excursions we took on busy streets with no
                    bike lanes or sidewalks. And there was a city recreation area nearby at which we
                    spent a lot of time playing ping-pong and board games besides sports. We also
                    played the board games we got for Christmas at each other's homes.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate to make another close friend at school, Joe Cucinelli, who was
                    extremely bright; he had a measured IQ of over140. We didn't play sports
                    together - only walked and talked, and played chess. He introduced me to it. He
                    too came from a poor background; his father earned his living in construction,
                    working on his own. His father was also a news fanatic, keeping newscasts
                    blaring on the radio all the time. Joe used to complain about it, but it
                    certainly introduced him to current national and world events. And he stimulated
                    my interest in them as well. I can remember in the early years of World War
                    discussing the war in Europe when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. And I
                    lost a bet with him; I thought the Nazis, the Germans would take Leningrad then
                    under siege, and he said they wouldn't. And that, besides the daily newspaper,
                    is what first got me interested in foreign affairs. Foreign affairs reminds me
                    of another classmate friend, George Kuztmark, because I was using his electric
                    jig saw in the basement of his home when his mother came half-way down the
                    stairs to tell us that the Japanese had just bombed Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an ethnic divide in your neighborhood or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, we had our own little Italy because I had an aunt across the
                    street from me who was the sister of my father and another aunt next door who
                    was also another sister of my father. Each of them, had several children with
                    whom we played. However, we associated freely with the other neighbors on the
                    street, only two of whom were Italian. One of them, Mrs. Contrucci, I think had
                    me picked out for her daughter, Roddy. She had more than an elementary school
                    education; my mother called her la Toscana, since she was from Tuscany. When she
                    moved, she gave us an upright piano which I assume she could play. No, there was
                    absolutely no ethnic divide in our neighborhood. In fact, some of those whom you
                    might call “traditional Americans” were very helpful to my father, like
                    providing information and inviting him to ride in their cars when going
                    shopping. My father never owned a car.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you speak Italian at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: We spoke the dialect; it gave me ear for standard Italian. But when I
                    entered the Foreign Service, I did the dawn patrol for a year to learn standard
                    Italian. It took me forever to get used to the polite Lei form, which
                    grammatically is the use of the third person feminine singular pronoun to
                    address the person you are speaking with, male or female. It took me a long time
                    to have the feeling that I was talking to that person and not about someone
                    else. But yes, it was a great benefit to speak the dialect as a child; not only
                    for pronunciation, but for sensing the meaning of Italian idioms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, for someone reading this, that the “dawn
                        patrol” was taking early morning classes for an hour and a half before
                        starting work at a quarter of nine, or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Obviously you were a Catholic; can you talk about the influence of the Church on
                    you and your family and your neighborhood there?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Pittsburgh is a very ethnically mixed city. The parish we belonged to,
                    St. Martin's was actually an ethnic German parish, and the school was taught by
                    an order of nuns which originated in Bavaria, Germany, the Sisters of Divine
                    Providence. They believed in corporal punishment to convince you to behave and
                    apply yourself. If you misbehaved, on the principal's next visit to the
                    classroom, you had to stick out your hand and swish, swish, swish you would get
                    it across the fingers from a bamboo switch she would bring out from under her
                    robe. My fourth grade teacher, Sister Josepha, actually banged my head into the
                    blackboard one day. I don't remember exactly why - I must have made a stupid
                    mistake on a problem I was doing on the board - but the head bang I remember
                    vividly. It is one of those little unconnected vignettes you remember from
                    childhood. And unlike today, the nuns had no need to worry that the parents
                    would complain. Another vivid vignette from my early childhood was standing by
                    my mother while she told my teacher, “If he doesn't behave, just whack him,” and
                    swinging her hand in a right cross to demonstrate. That was a terrifying moment,
                    but it worked; I didn't misbehave much in school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you attended mass, did you go to mass
                        each...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Without fail, every Sunday and on school days when there was a funeral
                    in the Church which was the top floor of the building. There was no escaping it;
                    I was in the choir. At funerals we sang in Gregorian chant, the “Dies Irae, Day
                    of Reckoning - literally, Day of Anger,” dressed in cassocks, surplices, white
                    stiff collar tied with black ribbons. And this reminds me of another little
                    childhood vignette. One year just before the Christmas holidays, our little
                    choir was invited to the big public high school auditorium to sing hymns. We
                    belted out “O Come All You Faithful” in English and Latin. I remember that big,
                    new public high school, Westlake, with affection, because when I was in the
                    seventh or eighth grade, we went there one afternoon a week for what they called
                    “manual training.” It's still there. There I learned the elements of carpentry,
                    from a Mr. Higgins, tall, thin, grey mustached, and incredibly adept with tools.
                    And I've used those skills off and on ever since. And almost every time I do I
                    think of think of Mr. Higgins and my godfather who was also a carpenter, and
                    whom I idolized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very good. About that time I learned - learned how
                        to print - I learned typesetting. You know, a completely useless field of
                        knowledge today, but I actually used to put the letters in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One other thing: as a kid, were you much of a reader?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed. I was. I do not know how it came about; I think it was because
                    I had this ravenous curiosity about just about everything, and because I found
                    my everyday life somewhat boring. We got the daily newspaper delivered, and I
                    used to open it up on the floor, and read it lying down. And not just the
                    comics, as we called them then. I got into books very early in elementary
                    school. There was a Carnegie public library only a few blocks from the school,
                    and I went there regularly. Another vivid, just horrific vignette of childhood
                    memory was almost getting run over by a trailer truck on my way to that library
                    one day. But yes, I could not get enough of reading. I had a sister two years
                    ahead of me, and I can still remember reading her high school history textbook,
                    just to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any type of books or any particular books
                        that early on were, you know, rather influential, or something you
                        especially remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, one of the most influential authors for me was the writer of The
                    Northwest Passage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kenneth Roberts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Kenneth Roberts, yes. I used to get totally absorbed in his historical
                    novels. Another vignette: I can still remember getting whacked by my mother
                    because, while deep into one of his books, I had let my two much younger
                    brothers I was supposed to be babysitting wander off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Kenneth Roberts; it is interesting because
                        looking back on it, I think one of the most influential books I read as a
                        kid was his Oliver Wiswell, because this was the story of a loyalist, and
                        all of a sudden I realized that there was another side to things, since in
                        our normal course of events you only hear about the revolutionaries; and all
                        of a sudden, you know, this one really opened my eyes to, gee, there are
                        other people with other outlooks. And I have never forgotten this,
                        so...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I had exactly the same impression. Thousands of them had to immigrate
                    to Canada when the Brits lost the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it is interesting. How did you do in school? Let's
                        talk about elementary school first.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. Well, I was a good student, but I never could ace anything. You
                    know, it was always 98 or 99 but not 100. And the nuns - the way they taught -
                    they encouraged competition between students and the boys and the girls. I would
                    always lose to Joe Cucinelli, my best friend on the boys side, and we would both
                    lose to Rose Casasanta, whose name means “holy house” in Italian. She always
                    went home with her arms wrapped around a ton of books, and, unlike me, she aced
                    everything. The nuns used to set up competitions on the board, like finding the
                    square root of a big number with a boy racing on the left and a girl on the
                    right, and the girl usually won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My vivid memories are of competitions with girls in
                        spelling bees and I was usually at the bottom; I hated those girls that
                        could spell. I still can't spell on my own; I require mechanical or digital
                        help on spelling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you get into the big city? I mean, did the kids go downtown in Pittsburgh
                    much?</p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Not a lot, but we did. Pittsburgh is not a huge city, you know, and in
                    the mountains. We lived about a 15 minute bus ride from the center of town. I
                    can remember once walking about five miles on a Sunday with friends to the newly
                    established Buhl Planetarium and Science Museum. That's when I first became
                    fascinated with astronomy. Yes, I have vivid memories of downtown Pittsburgh,
                    the so-called “golden triangle” formed by confluence of two rivers, one from the
                    north and one from the south, the Allegheny and the Monongahela...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is Fort Pitt...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI...which formed the Ohio river, which then flows southwest, off into the
                    Mississippi. Pittsburgh right after the war got started on a very ambitious
                    cleanup campaign. It was then known, of course, as the “Steel City” or “Smoky
                    City.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember as a kid going through there. Of course, you
                        were there and you know, we would look at the smoke, and say, my God, what a
                        place.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was probably about the most polluted city in the United States at
                    the time. But they got this very ambitious clean-up program going. I believe
                    they copied it from St. Louis, which started one a little earlier. I remember
                    them cleaning these large limestone buildings, and I cannot get over my
                    amazement one day - another of those vivid vignettes - at seeing this building
                    that was half cleaned: on the left shining white limestone, on the right dark,
                    black soot. It was incredible; I had had no idea that the building was
                    originally white. Pittsburgh went on to turn itself into one of the cleanest
                    cities in the country. Gradually, businessmen and politicians combined to
                    eliminated the railroads that ran right along the rivers to the Point - steam
                    locomotives were banned anywhere in the city; they eliminated all the steel
                    mills and warehouses that lined the rivers; and they eliminated the huge
                    Bessemer furnaces. Pittsburgh became a fantastic city, a desirable place to live
                    and visit.</p>

                <p>BASTIANI: Also...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a great era. I mean, you could not have asked for a
                        better era; some of the best movies that are still shown today came from
                        that era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, we had a little theater in Elliot - Elliott was the community in
                    which I lived above the West End. And it had this little theater which played
                    these weekly western serials; I can still remember prowling vacant lots with
                    friends picking up empty bottles to get two cents...</p>

                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, to pay for our tickets..</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. And we used to pay 10 cents for the ticket and one cent tax,
                    eleven cents, to go these movies every weekend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am just thinking, I am going under the assumption that
                        your family were staunch New Deal Democrats or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I never really got to know my father's politics; he died at age 50 in
                    1942 when I was 14. But yes, yes, the New Deal. I can remember an argument
                    between my uncle across the street who was a staunch New Deal Democrat and his
                    son-in-law, who was a Republican. My uncle practically attacked this son-in-law,
                    threw him out of the house because he had dared criticize Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>As for our family, when my father died, my mother was left to raise six children,
                    including my two younger brothers, one 10 years younger than me and the other 12
                    years younger. When those two came along, seven and nine years after my younger
                    sister, we older siblings were surprised. My brother, the oldest, in 1942 had
                    just graduated from high school. The local draft board exempted him from
                    military service, because he was the sole financial support of the family,
                    beyond Social Security. Roosevelt was revered by my extended family for that, as
                    well as the WPA, the Works Project Administration, which provided jobs to some
                    of them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the radio? Did you listen to Jack

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes indeed, almost every late afternoon, one after the other. My father
                    had bought us a new Zenith radio, a standup thing, and we spent hours sitting on
                    the floor in front of it, listening to the 15 minute serials, Jack Armstrong,
                    Orphan Annie, Tom Mix, listening to Pirate baseball games, listening to those
                    Joe Louis fights that got you all up tight inside. It is amazing how well they
                    did those serials. Your imagination painted all the pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Between your reading and the radio, I mean, this gave
                        great room for one to develop one's imagination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How about the war? I found this a great way of increasing one's knowledge of
                    geography and all. Did you follow the war closely?</p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I did indeed. I got started on it largely because of my good friend,
                    Joe Cucinelli, who was into world events before I was. I said I used to read the
                    newspaper lying down on the floor spread out. I can still remember an article
                    about Stalin with the title, “The Most Powerful Man in the World.” He had the
                    biggest army - this was before Barbarossa, before the Nazis invaded - and
                    learning a lot about Europe in that way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I have no real memory of that. In fact, at age 14 I went away to a
                    boarding school; so my memories of ethnic divisions about the war are more
                    related to high school. This boarding school was about 14 miles from Erie...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: At Sacred Heart Mission House, a so-called minor seminary of the
                    Catholic missionary order, the Society of the Divine Word, of German origin. It
                    was near a little town called Girard, Pennsylvania, on Highway 20, about 14
                    miles east of Erie, and about three miles from the shore of Lake Erie to the
                    north. What happened was that one day while in the eighth grade, a priest of the
                    order of the came to speak to the eighth graders about the missionary vocation.
                    And Father Hafner was the best salesman in the world for this missionary
                    vocation. The thought of going away to boarding school was exciting to me,
                    because I thought my life kind of boring. He was very inspirational as well. He
                    showed slides of the campus and sports facilities. My good friend Joe Cucinelli
                    got interested and I got interested as well, so we both applied. Unfortunately,
                    it turned out that Joe Cucinelli could not be accepted under the rules of the
                    Church at that time, so I ended up going alone.</p>
                <p>Well, the other thing was the cost. Your parents were supposed to pay some kind
                    of room and board; but, because of my mother's financial status, they took me
                    tuition-free. And so I went, and Joe didn't, and that was when we separated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this school designed to turn out priests or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was a so-called minor seminary. However, it had a regular high
                    school curriculum, with very strong emphasis on languages, especially Latin and
                    Greek. We had a very strict regimen; there was hardly a moment during the day
                    when you weren't programmed. I had Latin twice a day, morning and afternoon as a
                    freshman and got right into Caesar's Gallic Wars, which were absolutely
                    fascinating. The good priests were smart enough to keep all the ponies out of
                    the library, so the only way you could figure out what happened next was to
                    struggle with the Latin, like how Caesar outsmarted the German tribes who were
                    trying to keep him from crossing the Rhine by staying opposite his army on their
                    side as he marched up the shore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never was able to build that damn bridge in my Latin. I
                        might add, for somebody who is reading this, a pony, was... you might
                        explain what a pony was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, a pony was an English translation or summary of the Latin
                    text.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an all-male school, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: All males, all boys who had the intention of eventually joining the
                    order but getting a very intensive education, not just languages, but lots of
                    Math, and English, and History as well. And Greek; I had two years of Greek,
                    third and fourth years. Math proved to be my favorite subject. Getting back to
                    your point about ethnic divisions over the war; some of our teachers were from
                    Germany. I can still remember the rector who taught German. He kept telling us
                    the Allies would never be able to cross the Channel and invade “Fortress
                    Europa.” You could see they retained these emotional loyalties - at least some
                    of them - but we, the student body, whose parents were from different ethnic
                    backgrounds, were all for the U.S. And that goes as well for our teachers who
                    were of American background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as you went through school, was it sort of just
                        understood that you are going to end up in the army or other military
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: At the time, of course, if you were a divinity student you got a
                    deferment, 4D. So after I graduated from high school...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in 1946.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: This would be '46, exactly. I had a moment when I wasn't sure I wanted
                    to go on to the Novitiate; this is like a boot camp for religious life, two
                    years of intensive religious ascetic training. The seminary was located in a
                    little place called Techny, Illinois, just north of Chicago, between - I don't
                    if you know that area - but it's between Northbrook and Glenview. I almost
                    didn't go, but I did and I got my divinity school deferment. I may still have
                    the ID card. Of course, the draft board in Northbrook, Illinois, didn't like
                    this at all. I mean, here you had this seminary full of strapping, young men who
                    were deferred - who couldn't be drafted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you at this divinity school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: At the Seminary? St. Mary's Seminary, Techny, Illinois. I went to the
                    Novitiate two years, during which, academically we reviewed high school Latin
                    and Greek ad nauseum, but the main fare was the reading of meditations in
                    asceticism from an old Spanish author, Rodriguez, if I remember his name
                    correctly. We were completely under the direction of a Novice Master, Father
                    Glorius, who lectured us every day. He often called us “dish rags,” for lack of
                    will power. We did a lot of manual labor, mostly cleaning; we criticized each
                    other's faults; we even practiced the old asceticism which included
                    self-inflicted corporal punishment; lots of meditation; hours of prayer daily, a
                    thoroughly monastic regimen.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>After these two years you made your first annual vows of Poverty, Chastity and
                    Obedience. And then you had two years of the so-called Juniorate; really, an
                    intensive program of university studies. I had a year of physics, had a year of
                    biology; a semester of Hebrew, a semester of French, and, especially, a
                    continuation of Latin and Greek. This curriculum was modeled on the so-called
                    humanistic program in vogue in Europe, especially Germany, in the late 19th and
                    early 20th centuries.</p>
                <p>The next two years were a continuation, but with a switch to philosophy as the
                    dominant subject, taught in Latin, two classes a day. That's when I got hooked
                    on philosophy; defined - as my professor, Father Esser emphasized - as the study
                    of reality under the pure light of reason - not faith. He wrote himself the six
                    text books in Latin we used; Logic, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Psychology,
                    Ethics, and Cosmology. I still have them.</p>
                <p>Then a complete change in curriculum followed: four years of Theological studies
                    - what you might call professional studies. I only had the first two. At the
                    beginning of the third academic year on September 8, after five years of
                    renewing vows annually, one takes perpetual vows. I left the seminary in
                    mid-August 1954, and did not. Ordination to the three major orders, sub deacon,
                    deacon, and priest would have followed during the third year of theology. Then
                    there would have been one more year of theology during which I would have
                    received my first assignment, most likely as a missionary to a foreign
                    country.</p>
                <p>The Society of the Divine Word, like all religious orders, has as the first
                    objective for its members, “self-sanctification,” an endless inner struggle to
                    perfect oneself. However, like most religious orders, it has a social objective;
                    for it the objective of propagating the faith primarily through missionary
                    activity in mostly Third World countries.</p>
                <p>Founded only in 1875 by a German parish priest, Arnold Janssen, it is now active
                    in over 60 countries, making it one of the largest orders in the Church,
                    certainly one of the top 10. Because of restrictions on religious activity in
                    Bismarck's Germany arising from the so-called Kulturkampf, Culture war, Father
                    Janssen founded the order just across the border in a little town called Steyl,
                    S-T-E-Y-L, in Holland for the training of German missionaries. The order's
                    original institutions were called Mission Houses, where, as in Techny, Illinois,
                    they were as self-sufficient as possible with a farm, dairy and grain, a plant
                    nursery, a bakery and the practice of various trades like tailoring and
                    carpentry by Brothers of the Order. Father Janssen gave special priority to
                    printing magazines and other publications, so where possible, there was a
                    printing press as well. The first two missionaries went to China. While
                    vocations in the U.S. have pretty much dried up, they are they are plentiful in
                    some missionary countries. There are now many Vietnamese, Philippino, African,
                    and Indonesian priests and seminarians in the order - especially Indonesian.
                    Early on, about the largest mission of the Society was in Indonesia. They have a
                    seminary there with now with about 700 seminarians in training.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's probably a carryover from having moved to Holland,
                        and when Indonesia was the Dutch East Indies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Exactly, yes. When I was in the seminary, we all kind of dreamed of
                    where we wanted to go as a missionary. I settled on wanting to go to the
                    Catholic University of Beijing, of Peking. The order had founded a university -
                    not a seminary - there, some years before the Communists took over, and that was
                    my dream, to go there and teach. My second choice was the University of Cebu in
                    the Philippines where they had also founded a university. Of course, the
                    Catholic University of Peking was taken over by the communists, and the rector
                    at the time ended up serving 25 years, making matches in prison, because
                    allegedly he was an American spy. He told us his story at the Seminary after he
                    was finally released and repatriated with the help of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how far did you go with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, let's see, four years of high school in Girard, PA, two years of
                    Novitiate at St. Mary's Seminary in Techny, IL, two years of the so-called
                    Juniorate, one year of which was spent in Epworth, Iowa, along Highway 20 in the
                    middle of corn fields where the order had taken over a little Protestant little
                    seminary, then back to Techny, St. Mary's in Illinois for two years of
                    Philosophy, followed by two years of Theology; where are we now in years? I went
                    through all this from age 14 to age 26, so 12 years, if you count high school;
                    otherwise 8 years. I left the order in August of 1954, just before I would have
                    taken perpetual vows on September 8.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's go sort of towards the end game, the last
                        couple of years before you reached 26. What happened? What were you
                        doing...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I got hooked on philosophy, and I also got hooked on science as a
                    result, even though there hadn't been much science in the curriculum. Modern
                    physics in its origin was called natural philosophy. I can remember setting up
                    an experiment in the science lab one Sunday afternoon which shows water in its
                    three forms simultaneously as a vapor, liquid, and solid. You put water in a
                    shallow disk, in a sealed glass chamber and pump out the air creating a vacuum
                    until it happens. I was that enthused about science. I used to spend Sundays in
                    the library reading the history of science and, within physics got very
                    interested in nuclear physics and the philosophical questions it raised.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Now, the first principle of philosophy is that you look at truth only under the
                    light of reason; no faith, no revelation. I really became enamored of that idea
                    and fantasized that I was going to write the definitive proof that the one, holy
                    Catholic Church is the one true Church from, arguing purely from reason. I said
                    earlier that my philosophy professor, Father Esser, had written his own six
                    textbooks in Latin. My favorite subject among them was Epistemology. The theory
                    of knowledge, how do we know what we know? We have our minds and there is what
                    we call the real world out there. It was pretty much accepted that all knowledge
                    of the world comes through the senses. But how can anyone be sure that the world
                    isn't just an illusion, a projection of his mind? How do we get from here to
                    there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're pointing to your head and then pointing to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: From inside my head to the outside world, the real world. He selected
                    to give a talk on the subject on the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas, which is March
                    7. Modern philosophy pretty much began with Descartes. All we really know is
                    what is in our heads. How can we be sure that what we see is really out there,
                    not just a projection of our minds. Descartes in his Meditations tried to solve
                    the problem without assuming anything at all. The Anglican bishop Berkeley
                    became famous for having posed this conundrum, and arguing that we were
                    logically trapped within our heads. This philosophical teaching is called
                    “solipsism;” the Latin etymology means “self-alone.” Unfortunately, I no longer
                    have the text of the talk I gave in Latin on the subject, but what happened
                    while I spoke is another of those vignettes etched forever in my memory. I spoke
                    from a lectern set in front of the curtain on the stage. Alongside the lectern
                    they had hung a large picture of St. Thomas Aquinas. Well, while I was lecturing
                    away, the picture fell down, so I am not sure Aquinas approved of my thesis.</p>
                <p>Not long afterward, my passion for philosophy received a real jolt. I asked
                    permission to read Kant...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Immanuel Kant...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason in the original. He, as far as
                    I'm concerned, is the greatest of the so-called idealist philosophers, one of
                    the greatest philosophers ever, because his theory reconciled idealism and
                    realism through his categories which he said are innate in the mind. It's hard
                    to deny that some knowledge is innate; the aptitude for it, or the ability to
                    order it. I'm in no position to go into detail here. Well, I asked to read him
                    in the original, and I was turned down. You know, at this time the Church still
                    had its Syllabus of Forbidden Books, and you needed permission to read any book
                    in it. At age about 24, with all my education and with all my high motivation, I
                    really found it hard to take that I could not be trusted to read Kant in the
                    original.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>At about the same time, I began to wrestle with the relationship of faith to
                    reason. According to Aquinas, there can be no contradiction. What we believe in
                    divine revelation cannot be comprehended by human reason, because these truths
                    are beyond the capacity of human reason, such as the true nature of God, but
                    they do not contradict or can be contradicted by genuine truth discovered by
                    human reason. To reason, they are simply mysteries. If I got it right, this
                    Thomistic doctrine has been the view of the Church since the Middle Ages. But in
                    his own day, Aquinas almost got himself burned at the stake for some of his
                    teachings. Truth - reality - for him was fundamental and eternal. He said he
                    would even accept truth from the devil, as long as it was the truth. So he was
                    and remains a model for me, an ideal. In the Seminary I had a copy of his Summa
                    Teologica. I passed to a friend when I left. It must be very valuable as an
                    antique book by now; it had printed in the 19th century. I got it as a gift from
                    my philosophy teacher, Father Esser, when he gave an optional seminar on Aquinas
                    Sunday afternoons.</p>
                <p>My obsession with looking for truth under the light of reason alone led me to
                    realize that I wasn't sure I any longer believed everything I was being taught
                    in my professional studies, just as it was being taught, particularly in a
                    course called Apologetics - arguments in defense of the divine origin of the
                    Church. It's a branch of Theology, but doesn't use divine revelation, but facts,
                    mostly historical, and reasoning. I thought many of the arguments assumed too
                    much and seemed superficial and arbitrary. And if you're going to be an officer
                    in this army, well then you accept these arguments, or get out. You would have
                    to be using them.</p>
                <p>I didn't have the guts to say I wanted out or even challenge openly - I was at an
                    advanced stage in my training where it was much easier to go along than get out.
                    Instead I wrote a kind of manifesto of my intellectual problems - somehow I
                    remember it was 18 pages - and began to discuss it with my superior, the Prefect
                    of Seminarians. I'd give anything if I could get a copy of it; I'm not sure I
                    even kept a copy at the time - it would have had to be a carbon. At first he
                    didn't see that I had any serious problem, but as time went on - I don't know
                    how many sessions we has - he did. Let me say that, unlike the professor of
                    Apologetics, I really admired this superior, Father Musinsky; he was absolutely
                    brilliant. In fact he eventually served as the Superior General of the entire
                    order in Rome. He died this last year, and I deeply regret not getting out to
                    Techny to see him before he passed away. But he had no problem with faith, and I
                    kind of marveled that he didn't. I read various books by Jesuits and others on
                    faith and reason. There's at least a shelf of them in Catholic libraries,
                    probably a whole bookcase, if you started researching this subject.</p>
                <p>My case got passed to the Society's headquarters in Rome, along with my
                    manifesto, I assume. I was told the decision came back in one Latin word,
                    “Dimittatur,” which translates literally as “Let him be dismissed,” or, more
                    idiomatically, “Expel him.” Looking back on it, instead of deciding myself to
                    leave, I forced them to expel me by being so sincere about my doubts. I also
                    heard from someone that the Apologetics professor said I was one who had lost
                    the faith - but through no real fault of my own.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>And so, about August 15, 195I don't remember the exact day - I ended up on the
                    railroad platform at Northbrook, Illinois, with father Musinsky, a suitcase of
                    clothing, and 140 bucks in my pocket to take the train to Chicago. I did not
                    continue on home to Pittsburgh, but went straight to a house of the lay order,
                    Opus Dei, to stay temporarily. Father Musinsky had made the arrangement for me.
                    I did not go home because I knew there was no way I could make my mother
                    understand why I left the seminary. I had written a long letter to her and my
                    older brother and sister who lived with her. I didn't want to try to explain
                    myself further. Some months later they drove to Chicago; they were still
                    mystified, but supportive financially. They gave me one admonition: Get out of
                    philosophy and into something useful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this fairly routine that young men were, you know,

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Persevere?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not persevere, but just could not accept what they were
                        being set up to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I wouldn't say that. I will say that I don't know of anyone else who
                    left for the reason I did. In fact, most of seminarians I studied with did
                    leave; very few made it to the priesthood. Early on, some were expelled because
                    our very tough Novice Master decided they were too frivolous, fun loving,
                    weren't serious enough. I later concluded he did the Order a great harm by
                    getting rid of people who would have become great missionaries. Some of these
                    went on to become parish priests. Some were expelled simply because they
                    couldn't pass the courses, despite great effort. But, yes, many left because
                    they obviously decided that this was not for them. When someone simply
                    disappeared from the community, we used to joke, especially in the Novitiate,
                    that he had decided to propagate the faithful instead of the faith. I found that
                    most outsiders assume that a person simply wanted to have a normal sex life,
                    wanted to get married. At least I found that most assumed that about me after I
                    left. Anyway, I went directly to the University of Chicago campus, because...Did
                    you ever hear of Mortimer Adler?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: And Robert Hutchins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Hutchins, was he still around at the time or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't know that they were still around, but, as I remember, they had
                    established a program at the University of Chicago for so-called mature
                    students. These were mostly people who went into the military right after high
                    school, did not get a college education, but then after discharge used their
                    military benefits to go to college. Adler and Hutchins had devised a battery of
                    tests for such applicants, I think over three days. Depending on the results,
                    they would then write a specific program for each student to qualify for a
                    degree. I took this battery of tests because my seminary education at the time
                    was not accredited, and received graduate standing without the need to meet any
                    other requirement.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I was casting about trying to find a job while I was staying at
                    that Opus Dei house. Everybody's heard of Opus Dei these days because of that
                    novel. Opus Dei is made up of lay people, non-clerical persons who live a
                    religious life as bachelors while pursuing a career like teaching at a
                    university, and live in small communities. They don't proselytize, except
                    perhaps by example. They are extremely admirable persons, which is why I will
                    never read that novel which denigrates and libels them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The novel we're talking about is The Da Vinci Code.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's right. Anyway, I stayed with them a couple weeks while I cast
                    about trying to find employment, husbanding what was left of my $140 dollars,
                    while paying Opus Dei for my room and board. I remember taking two buses out to
                    the far west side of Chicago to work for a real estate agency for about two
                    weeks. I went with one of the agents as a trainee, knocking on doors and asking
                    the owners if they wished to sell their houses. Almost everybody says he is,
                    even if he isn't, because he wants to know how much his house is worth. The
                    agency's objective was to get an exclusive listing to sell the house, exclusive
                    because that meant that no one else could sell it. All I got out of that
                    experience were two or three free lunches. When I quit, I was told the agency
                    would send me a commission if any of the listings that I participated in getting
                    ever sold. Of course, I never heard again.</p>
                <p>I remember also going downtown and filling out bunch of questionnaires at an IBM
                    office. They were recruiting junior executives. I was really put out by some of
                    the psychological questions which obviously probed whether you would cheat if
                    you could, things like that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, this is a period where, I think the book, The
                        Organization Man, had come out, and they were really, the corporations were
                        really looking at people who, you know, if given the choice between
                        furthering the interest of the organization or letting your mother die,
                        would obviously would opt for the organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, that's exactly how it was. There were also a bunch of little math
                    problems I had no trouble with, since math had been a favorite subject from
                    grammar school on. When I finally got my interview with a middle-aged, lady, I
                    was simply told that I was overqualified. And that was the end of my application
                    to work for IBM.</p>
                <p>I vaguely remember applying for a management job with some milk company. That too
                    came to naught. I finally ended up taking a job - I can't remember how I came to
                    apply for it - in the admissions office of the University of Chicago. I got a
                    job transcribing dictated letters from admissions counselors to prospective
                    students from Dictaphones which used plastic belts. Do you remember them?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Anyway, What got me the job is that I was a touch typist, even though
                    they hadn't been taught touch typing in high school or the Seminary. While a
                    sophomore in high school I had just decided I wanted to learn touch typing, so I
                    used to borrow a friend's little portable and touch typed all my letters home on
                    this thing, no matter how long it took. Once, right through the time I should
                    have been in the Chapel for the prayers at noon. That got me into trouble,
                    because my family had telephoned during that time, and the prefect found I
                    wasn't where I should have been. I never went through all those A-F-D-F-G-F
                    exercises and what have you because that was boring, but I did become touch
                    typist by simply not looking at the keys.</p>
                <p>Getting this job was a stroke of good fortune. The head of this office was a
                    fantastic woman named Ruth Benedict. By this time, I had my graduate standing
                    and had applied to enter the Department of Philosophy, without knowing how I was
                    going to pay for it. I must have applied for a scholarship, or what they call
                    financial aid these days, but I didn't have much hope. So it came as great
                    pleasant surprise when Ruth Benedict told me that I would receive a full,
                    renewable tuition scholarship for graduate school. She had apparently made sure
                    I got it. I remain eternally grateful to her, and eternally regretful that I did
                    not look her up when she came to Washington later on to accept a management
                    position - I believe with the National Science Foundation</p>
                <p>I went straight into the Philosophy Department because I wasn't looking for a
                    profession; I was looking for answers to questions which had led to my leaving
                    the seminary. Chicago was famous as the school for the study of the works of
                    major philosophers. You start with Plato and Aristotle and you go right
                    through...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they have the great books program.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: They had the great books program, too, and they also had an
                    internationally well-known professor, Richard McKeon, an Aristotelian. The
                    original center of the University of Chicago is a beautiful campus which looks
                    like I think an institution of learning should: two quadrangles of ivy-covered
                    buildings of gothic architecture. The philosophy department was in a building
                    right on the main quadrangle. The theological school where students trained for
                    the ministry was in the same building, and they took philosophy courses as well.
                    In fact, I believe the University of Chicago had been originally founded as a
                    theological school. And so I found myself in this exciting intellectual
                    environment.</p>
                <p>In June 1957, I got a master's degree in philosophy with specialization in logic
                    and the philosophy of science. My specialization was sort of out of the main
                    stream for the U of C. The Department had recognized its deficiency in these
                    fields which then - along with positivism and the philosophy of language, both
                    closely related to the philosophy of logic - were in fashion then at some of the
                    Ivy League schools, especially Harvard. So they brought into the faculty a pure
                    positivist from Montreal - whose escapes me at the moment - under whom I wrote
                    my master's dissertation, and Hans Dreben from Harvard, a young disciple of
                    Quine, a leading language philosopher. Dreben loved to perform intellectually at
                    table in the cafeteria at lunch time. I found these sessions better than his
                    classes. His enthusiasm for his abstruse subject was infectious. He introduced
                    me to mathematical logic, about the hardest subject I ever encountered. Needless
                    to say, I didn't master it.</p>
                <p>Now, let me make back flip to when I was leaving the seminary. I became 26 in
                    March 1954. That was the age limit for being drafted into the army. Just before
                    I left in August, I called the local draft board and said, “I have this 4D
                    deferment, but I'm leaving the seminary. What does that to my draft status?”
                    This lady I was speaking to came right back without a pause, 1A, 1A, 1A.” 1A was
                    the classification which got called into the service tomorrow, so to speak. And
                    then I asked: “Does it make any difference that I'm now 26 years old?” And again
                    without missing a beat she came right back: “Can't touch you, can't touch you,
                    and can't touch you.” Eligibility for the draft then expired at age 26. So that
                    put an end of any idea I had of joining the military. However, there were times
                    in those penurious following years that I wished I had. Without the benefits
                    veterans received for education and buying homes, and health, and pensions, I
                    sometimes felt like a second class citizen. In fact, when I later took the
                    Foreign Service exam, I found that veterans received a bonus of five points on
                    their scores. I certainly could have used them.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Anyway, back to Chicago. I got my Masters, and the normal thing to do was go for
                    a doctorate. After all, what other occupation is open to philosophers, but to
                    teach philosophy. My two closest friends in philosophy at the time did go on to
                    a doctorate, and so did just about everyone else in our larger circle of
                    friends. But by this time - I was 29 years old - and damned sick of being in an
                    academic environment. Besides, the dominant fads of the day in modern
                    philosophy, language philosophy and existentialism didn't appeal to me at all.
                    Existentialism makes for great novels, but is not really philosophy. It's all in
                    the mind and emotions. And language philosophy, Semanticism, is a dead end. It
                    never gets past the dictionary. I'm a holistic philosopher in the tradition of
                    the Ancient and European philosophers. Philosophy must be comprehensive and
                    consistent. But since it speculates beyond what is accepted as established
                    knowledge, it can lead to endless speculation more and more divorced from what
                    we accept as reality. My two closest friends and I used to take walks talking
                    philosophy. They were really into speculation, and argued endlessly. I took less
                    and less part in the conversations, and finally told them, “Well, if you divorce
                    yourself from reality and just speculate, possibilities are infinite, and you
                    can gorge yourself on speculation without ever saying anything relevant to the
                    world as it is. That was my approach. So I was open to an alternative to going
                    on for a Ph.D., at least for a few years. I never completely abandoned the idea
                    of teaching at the university level.</p>
                <p>While getting my degree, I had taken the Foreign Service written exam, which is
                    given annually all over the world still today to about 20,000 or more
                    applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had you heard about this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, just before I left the seminary, a fellow seminarian had
                    suggested it. His name was Urbik, and, after he too left the seminary, became
                    rather wealthy in the insurance field. At least so I heard; I never spoke saw
                    him again. I passed the written, but not with great grades because I had done
                    nothing to prepare for it and had never taken an economics course. However, I
                    did not pass the oral exam which came next. The three-officer panel didn't think
                    much of my limited background; in fact one of them advised me to join the
                    military to get some experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions that were asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: One I think was “Why is the Canadian dollar worth less than the
                    American dollar? I said I hadn't had any economics. I may be confounding -
                    there's a better word for confounding...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Conflating.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Conflating, exactly; conflating questions on the first exam with
                    questions on the second oral exam. Another question was, “You're in India, at
                    our Embassy in New Delhi. At a cocktail party this Indian professor comes up to
                    you and asks, 'Who are you to be telling us what to do, when there is so much
                    crime and corruption in the United States?' It's in the news every day. How
                    would you answer him?” At that time, of course, Congressional Committees like
                    the Kefauver Committee were holding hearings on the wide corruption in the labor
                    unions. As these oral exams were conducted then, at least, there was no way of
                    knowing what kind of questions you were going to get. It all depended on the
                    backgrounds of the three guys you were confronted with, and they're not going to
                    ask questions they don't know the answer to.</p>
                <p>Failing that first oral proved a traumatic experience, because by then I really
                    wanted to join the Service. So I decided to go back to Go without collecting
                    $200.00 and retake the Foreign Service written exam the next year. I passed it
                    again, and so I was determined to prepare as I could for the oral exam. At the
                    same time I was in the middle of writing my Master's dissertation; so,
                    intellectually, it was a very busy time for me. I went to the library and took
                    out a stack of books on the geography and history of the U.S. and economics. At
                    the same time I read Time or Newsweek every week from cover to cover to be
                    current on events - then, at least, they pretty much covered the latest
                    developments in the major fields, even nuclear physics. I made sure I knew the
                    answers to the questions I had flubbed on the first oral exam. But the book I
                    found most useful, at least enjoyed the most, was a diplomatic history of the
                    United States by...who is our famous diplomatic historian?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, a man named Stewart wrote books about...oh, of
                        course, Bemis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Bemis, yes, Samuel Bemis, A Diplomatic History of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Samuelson was the economic author you read, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, Principles of Economics, Samuelson. Well, anyway, this time I was
                    much better prepared; but I think what got me through was telling them about my
                    dissertation which I was up to my ears in. When someone near the beginning of
                    the session asked me what I was doing, I launched into it. It had a very
                    ambitious title, “The Meaning of Probability in Quantum Mechanics.” The question
                    from the beginning of physics, even from ancient times, has been, “Is light a
                    wave or a particle?” It demonstrated the properties of both in experiments. My
                    thesis summarized the history of the issue, and supported Einstein's criticism
                    that Quantum Mechanics was not the last word on what happens within the atom. So
                    I just sort of lectured these guys on this subject; and they showed a lot of
                    interest by asking follow-up questions. But of course I also gave better answers
                    to some of the other questions they asked.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when did you take the exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I took the oral exam in 1957, the physical exam and background
                    investigation soon followed, and I was put on a rank ordered waiting list. In
                    the meantime I met my wife, my future wife and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were getting pretty close to the age of
                        non-acceptance, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. There was a limit of age 31 or 32 to enter from the bottom. I
                    entered the Service on January 4, 1960, after waiting about two years. What had
                    happened was my rank order was not all that high and people with higher grades
                    kept getting inserted ahead of me, and so I waited and waited. I was told there
                    was a budget problem as well; for one year they hadn't taken in anyone. I kept
                    waiting for this call to Washington. And so in the meantime, what did I do?</p>
                <p>First I worked part time at the University of Chicago Clinics, a research
                    hospital in the so-called Special Services Department, a euphemism for billing
                    and complaints. I also audited a couple of graduate courses in the International
                    Relations Department of the University, a privilege I had as an employee, since
                    I didn't have the income to pay the tuition. The one which greatly influenced my
                    thinking throughout my career was given by Hans Morgenthau, the author of
                    Politics Among Nations.</p>
                <p>I met my wife and got married. The next year I taught algebra and geometry in a
                    Jesuit high school in the upscale suburb, Wilmette; five classes a day totaling
                    about 140-145 students; and a weekly activities class in ham radio. I also
                    earned additional money driving one of the school buses on my way to and from
                    the school. I would start out from the little garden apartment my wife and I
                    rented - these are the ones that are half underground - in Rogers Park,
                    Illinois, drive to the Loyola University campus where they parked the school
                    buses, park my car and then drive this devious route through the suburbs to the
                    school, teach the five classes of math, then drive the bus back dropping off the
                    kids I had picked up in the morning.</p>
                <p>On Tuesdays and Thursdays after parking the bus, I would take the train to
                    Loyola's downtown campus to teach a seminar in symbolic logic to graduate
                    students in philosophy at the University of Loyola's downtown campus.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The Jesuits at Loyola University in Chicago had finally realized that the
                    syllogisms of Aristotle and Aquinas were not the last word in logic. I had
                    studied modern logic, symbolic logic. Theoretically, you can take any written
                    argumentation, put it in symbols and, following simple logical rules come out at
                    the bottom with a conclusion showing the argument, truth or false. Something
                    like solving mathematical equations. But its fatal flaw is interpreting into
                    symbols the terms you use; words don't all mean precisely the same things to
                    everyone. It was the most pleasant teaching experience I had in all my life - no
                    disciplinary problems which caused me no end of grief in my high school
                    teaching. But we got ahead in our finances while we waited to enter the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>Soon our first daughter was born, and we were still waiting and waiting for that
                    call from Washington. I had rushed the wedding in anticipation of being called
                    into the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give me a little quick background of how you met your wife
                        and her background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. At the University of Chicago, after I had finished the Master's
                    dissertation, I took a job at the University of Chicago Clinics, in an office
                    working evening hours called the Special Services Department. “Special services”
                    was a euphemism for billings and complaints. When patients were discharged they
                    had to come down to this office to settle their bills and insurance. Also
                    working in that office was a woman married to a medical intern, and we used to
                    talk. Her husband took care of children at La Rabida Children's Hospital behind
                    the Museum of Science and Industry. La Rabida was a private organization for
                    cardiac children, children who had had rheumatic fever or what have you, and
                    whose days were numbered. One of the hobbies I had picked up in the seminary was
                    ham radio. I had managed to get a General Class ham radio license; my call
                    letters were W9BBY. Of course I had told Eva Gross - that was her name - she
                    told her husband, and he suggested that I teach ham radio to the children at La
                    Rabida.</p>
                <p>The FCC had recently established a new Novice Class license for which a speed of
                    only five words a minute in Morse code was required. Anyone holding a general
                    class license could teach it. So I agreed to do it. My future wife, Dorothy
                    Gietzen, was on her first job as the licensed occupational therapist at this
                    hospital. So that's how we met. Our first sort of date was to go to Allied Radio
                    at 100 Northwestern Avenue to buy the components to make a code oscillator, a
                    code practicing gizmo. She was as interested in me as I was in her from the
                    moment we met. In the end, she not only got a Novice Class ham radio license,
                    but a marriage license as well. Since her income was much better than mine, the
                    downtown jewelry shop where I bought the engagement and marriage rings required
                    her to co-sign the credit loan. She was from Grand Rapids, Michigan; her
                    grandfather had immigrated from Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape two, side one with Carl Bastiani, and we had
                        just finished leading up to your joining the Foreign Service. You came into
                        the Foreign Service when, Carl?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was January, 1960. I came in actually from Chicago, from Illinois,
                    where I had been residing for several years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this your first time in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Practically speaking, yes. I had once visited Washington in 1946 for a
                    few days, I believe in '52, by car with my brother, just for tourism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, so in 1960 you went into what we now call the
                        A-100 course, the basic officer course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of describe the composition of the course
                        and how it struck you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: As I recall it was an eight weeks course at the old FSI, Foreign
                    Service Institute. We were about 25, 26 entering officers, an eclectic group
                    from all over the country, and I would say about half of us were older than the
                    normal-entry-from-the bottom age. For budgetary reasons, the Service had not
                    been qualifying any new applicants for about two years. Most of us may have been
                    the bottom of the barrel of people on the rank order list. I suppose it was my
                    good fortune.</p>
                <p>My high school teaching credentials had not been renewed in mid-1959 for not
                    having acquired the educational credits I was supposed to acquire when I was
                    hired in the first place - at least that was the reason given me - so I had
                    taken a full time job as a sales correspondent in a tightly managed
                    manufacturing firm in Lake Zurich, Illinois, just northwest of Chicago. My main
                    job was to back up sales correspondents on the road who solicited orders for
                    sets of baking pans from companies which supplied bread to the stores. I was
                    supposed to gin up quotes in the thousands of dollars and immediately phone them
                    to the salesmen. They had hired me because of my mathematical background,
                    because they had just fired someone because he had made a mistake. I only
                    learned that later.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was doing well in the job, but I didn't like it; I couldn't see myself
                    doing this for the rest of my life. Well, around Thanksgiving day, six months
                    into the job, I get a phone call from Washington informing me that a new class
                    was entering January 4th, 1960 and asking if I was interested. I almost leapt
                    through the phone and accepted immediately. The awkward thing about it was that
                    my probation with this firm had just ended, and I had been accepted. I knew
                    this, because on the previous Friday evening, I had been invited to the Green
                    Lantern for cocktails. Only the in-group went on Friday night to the Green
                    Lantern for cocktails. The boss grudgingly congratulated me when I resigned,
                    saying, that for anybody else but the U.S. Government he would have been really
                    teed off with me. It was liberation, absolute liberation. I drove to Washington
                    having placed my wife and daughter with her parents in Grand Rapids,
                    Michigan.</p>
                <p>Getting back to your question about the A-100 course, well, I don't remember a
                    lot of detail. What stands out is the extended weekend or a week at a house in
                    Front Royal, Virginia, where I guess we were under observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, the idea was to get you off-site, to get you
                        out and away from the nine to five thing; I think it's to mold you into a
                        cohesive group or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, it really worked; we really bonded out there. We played bridge
                    one night and I'm not a skillful bridge player because I always refused to
                    memorize all these darn openings and what have you, but it was remarkable for me
                    because I did bid and make a grand slam, about the only time in my life. And I
                    was fired up; I was really enthused about the career. We came in in 1960 in the
                    depth of the Cold War, Kennedy and the missile gap; you may recall the talk
                    about...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was during campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was during the campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The missile gap and Quemoy and Matsu were the main issues
                        between Nixon and Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I just don't recall most of the specifics of the course, but it
                    accomplished its purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, I mean, this is certainly true of me and
                        others who have gone into this; you've heard about diplomacy and when you
                        looked at it, did you feel at all apprehensive? I mean, who am I to be in
                        this business?</hi>

                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed, but I'm not a guy who underestimates his potential; I
                    overestimate it all the time. Later on when I was much more mature and had to
                    rate some young officers, I came to realize that an officer who doesn't think
                    he's better than he is isn't really a suitable officer. You want somebody who's
                    got a lot of confidence in his abilities. And so I never faulted young officers
                    for seemingly being overambitious.</p>
                <p>As for how I felt when I entered, I had been following international relations
                    quite closely on as broad a scale as I could from the newspapers and some
                    courses that I took at the University of Chicago. I saw East-West relations as
                    the great problem, the Cold War. The focus was in Europe, and in Europe the
                    focus was Germany, and in Germany, Berlin. So that's where I wanted to go. I
                    wanted to contribute to the solution there. We were asked to list our three
                    preferences in order as to where we wanted to go on our first assignment; I said
                    Berlin or anywhere else in Germany or anywhere else in Europe except Italy,
                    because I had relatives in Italy, and I assumed they wouldn't send me there
                    anyway. But I was assigned as a staff assistant to the Senior Seminar, which was
                    about 50 feet down the corridor of FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was what's still today called Arlington Towers, which
                        is about the first apartment complex when you go to Roslyn in Northern
                        Virginia, right across the Potomac from the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: And I found out that I had been selected for this job by the Director
                    of the Senior Seminar, Charlie O'Donnell, the late Charles O'Donnell, because of
                    my general academic and philosophical background, because the course itself is a
                    smorgasbord of subjects. In effect, I took that course twice as a junior
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: And it was the best Washington assignment that I had in my whole
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we're talking about '60 to '62. Let's talk
                        about the course; how was the Senior Seminar; what was it designed to do,
                        and what was it doing, and what were your experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Senior Seminar was designed to update Foreign Service officers with
                    15 or more years of experience on what was going on in the United States,
                    economically, politically, socially, scientifically, and in the various
                    geographic regions of the United States which some had never even been to. At
                    that time many senior Foreign Service officers hadn't lived in the States for a
                    decade or more; they went, often directly, from one foreign assignment to
                    another. There was a perceived need to educate the leaders in the Foreign
                    Service on their own country. The staff was very simple; the Director, the
                    Deputy Director, me and two secretaries. One of the senior seminarians told to
                    me I as the staff's only officer on the working level. It was quite flattering
                    because you had these 20, 25 officers, four to six of them from various
                    agencies, CIA, DIA, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Treasury.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Treasury. Often, you know, the Director was out, the Deputy Director
                    was out, and someone like Colonel Itz - he used to call himself, one plus two,
                    I-T-Z - would say, I need to go to a doctor's appointment or I need to go fly:
                    may I? And I would give him permission, as the only one in authority.</p>
                <p>I definitely was on the working level because we would have two or three
                    different speakers a week for seminars on what is going on today in the
                    speaker's field. A professor would be invited, say from MIT, and when he
                    accepted, would be requested to send us his bio, a relatively brief required
                    reading, and short bibliography. I would then do the syllabus for the session.
                    Quite frequently these speakers would not submit anything in advance, so I would
                    end up getting their bios from Who's Who and other sources, and looking at their
                    major publications, find an article that seemed to fit our purpose to assign as
                    required reading for the session, and also make up a little bibliography of
                    recommended reading. I would then have it printed and distributed. I would meet
                    speakers and escort them as necessary. I remember vividly escorting Margaret
                    Mead, the anthropologist, on the shuttle bus from the Department to FSI; because
                    that was the day the Pirates beat the Yankees in the World Series with a homer
                    in the 9th.</p>
                <p>And then we would have these so-called critique sessions, once every two weeks or
                    so - I don't recall the exact frequency - for which I was the note-taker. I
                    would dictate these notes to the secretary for distribution. I also handled all
                    the dealings with the administrative office for trips to different regions; the
                    trips I remember best were to Los Angeles, Detroit and Texas, especially the
                    latter; and handle all that bureaucratic paperwork, you know, travel vouchers
                    and payment for the tickets. Our hosts usually provided dinners and other
                    hospitality. It was a fascinating two years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the changeover to the Kennedy
                        Administration; it was an interesting time because more changed than the
                        normal changes of the parties, but it was a generational change as well.
                        Were you able to pick up some of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: There wasn't much talk of national politics in the course environment.
                    But speaking of change, what really hit me was the difference of dealing with
                    foreign policy issues in an academic environment from which I had just come, and
                    dealing with them in the State Department environment. I was struck with the
                    contrast with that graduate seminar given by Hans Morgenthau. While the course
                    was on political ideologies, he was also sounding off about the Vietnam War. I
                    remember him strutting back and forth in his striped suit with vest and pocket
                    watch, pontificating on how Washington didn't have a clue on the issues; how
                    stupid the policy was, and how little Washington knew what it was doing. The
                    contrast in approach came as a revelation. At the U of C I found that to be so
                    much the general attitude, that I was almost embarrassed to tell friends that I
                    had accepted an appointment to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Yes, in academia you can sit in your ivory tower and devise solutions for
                    international problems like the Middle East. And your solutions would all be so
                    reasonable and logical. But the State Department then has to figure out how you
                    get from here to there. The academics for the most part don't take into account
                    when they formulate their solutions, that, to carry out policies, the State
                    Department must deal with powerful leaders in independent countries who have
                    specific prejudices or biases, the sentiments of the people and what have you.
                    So the nitty-gritty part they ignore; but no solution can be applied, no
                    solution can be pursued unless you have these day in and day out, nitty gritty
                    dealings with the leaders and peoples of the countries involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is why sometimes it works well when you have this
                        academics coming in and working on National Security Council or in the State
                        Department or Congressional Committee staffs, and then going back to the
                        academic world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You know, you're pointing out something; I was wondering what the reaction of
                    people participating in the Seminar - I'm , I'm talking about the State
                    Department but others to0 - was to this almost complete disconnect between the
                    academic world, a sort of chattering class, and the Foreign Service. You know,
                    after I interview people and I go back to doing my own thing, I hardly ever read
                    the literature that comes out. I mean, these are people talking to themselves at
                    the universities; there doesn't seem to be much there that's practical. Was that
                    coming out to the students in the Seminar?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I think so, yes. I think they were extremely good in their questioning
                    of these experts who had facile solutions to problems. One speaker I remember
                    very well; he was an economist, I don't remember his name, but I never forgot
                    what he said. He related how the only thing that got us out of the recession
                    finally was World War II, by going to total production. And his solution for
                    keeping the economy going was to just keep producing, producing even if we have
                    to take these tanks out and dump them in the middle of the ocean. It's the flow
                    of economic activity that creates jobs and causes money to circulate.</p>
                <p>I took the Principles of Economics course based on Samuelson's book by the same
                    name evenings at Georgetown. FSI offered officers the opportunity to courses in
                    line with your career interests and pay for them as long as you completed them.
                    That course was a great help to me because the big gap in my background was
                    economics. I never forgot learning about the multiplier effect of money as it
                    circulates through the economy. Also, I became Keynesian in the belief that
                    government sometimes had to sort of prime the economic pump with deficit
                    spending to restore economic activity in a recession. I had studied theories of
                    probability at the U. of C., and was happy to see that Keynes had devised his
                    own theory of subjective probability, a theory I had favored in philosophy. Of
                    course, the only one we ever hear about is the so-called objective theory, the
                    scientific theory; you know, for example, flipping a coin repeatedly and noting
                    how many times it comes up heads or tails divided by the number of flips,
                    statistics generally.</p>
                <p>The other is subjective, internal; for example, you walk the door, you look at
                    the clouds, you sniff the air and say; it will probably rain today. So you go
                    back in and get your umbrella. Here you are not applying the scientific notion
                    of probability; but a sense of probability most of us operate with every day: a
                    sort of wisdom derived from experience.</p>
                <p>However, the weather predictions we get today on radio and TV are, of course
                    based on the scientific notion, statistics.</p>
                <p>But that's a digression. I couldn't have had better preparation for a Foreign
                    Service career than having been on the staff of the Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me about what's his name, the head of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Charlie O'Donnell had been head of the political science department at
                    DePaul University in Chicago, and came to Washington during the war. I don't
                    exactly know to what job, but somehow or other after the war he transferred to
                    the Foreign Service, and had a rather successful career. He was very academic in
                    his approach because of his background. You know, everybody has his little
                    quirks, and I found out how to deal with Charlie O'Donnell. If I proposed an
                    idea - you know, a speaker to invite or whatever - he would usually dismiss it
                    out of hand, and I would say no more. But then, maybe a day or two later he
                    might say - without any reference to my previous suggestion - I think we should
                    invite professor so-and-so to speak. So, you had to seed ideas into his mind;
                    apparently he would work them over, and they would come out as his own. The
                    deputy director, Harry Byrnes, was often at odds with him. He was a generous
                    guy, but, ideologically, very liberal and emotionally anti-fascist. Once I
                    mentioned as a matter of fact that the German economy had improved in the late
                    thirties under Hitler. He got emotional and said it hadn't at all. Apparently,
                    he found it impossible to accept that anything had improved under Hitler. His
                    brother-in-law was Walter Lippmann, then in his heyday, and he used to tell me
                    of his differences of opinion with him. He was very generous and a dear friend.
                    I much enjoyed the relationship.</p>
                <p>The thing about me is - I don't know if it's my personality, a gene or what - but
                    my approach in a discussion is not to give priority to who's right, but what's
                    right, and accept it, even if it is contrary to what I would like to be right.
                    It's what I learned through philosophy, and what I think is the only way to
                    practice philosophy. And this tendency goes way back. I can still remember being
                    criticized by my high school teacher in a debate in for conceding a point to the
                    classmate arguing the other side of the question. The teacher immediately
                    intervened and said, “In a debate, you never concede anything.” Giving priority
                    to what's right sometimes leads dedicated officers to oppose official policies,
                    as during the Vietnam war. However, I question the sincerity or motivation of
                    those who do it openly, resign with fanfare, and publish dissents in the
                    Washington Post or New York Times.</p>
                <p>But to be insistent on the “what's right” approach can get you into trouble in a
                    bureaucracy, or any institution. So, I developed a sort of algorithm for
                    applying it during my early tour in INR (1969-1971), the Bureau of Intelligence
                    and Research. First, an issue had to be important to even think of arguing about
                    it. For many, it makes no real difference whether decision A, B, or C is taken -
                    as long as one of them is taken. It makes no sense to oppose the one the person
                    with authority chooses. Secondly, always, you treat what you think is right on a
                    specific issue only as a working hypothesis, subject to change as more facts
                    come to your attention. Reality is a process, open ended, particularly
                    international developments; you seldom have enough relevant facts to be
                    absolutely certain of what the right policy should be. No one ever has all the
                    facts to be certain he is right. But if an issue is a major one and up for
                    decision - requires a reaction from the U.S. Government - and you are in a
                    position to influence it, then you argue. But you do so within the system, you
                    don't call a press conference. And, finally, if the issue is one of conscience -
                    very few really are - then you resign.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I don't know what I would have done if, during the Clinton years, I would have
                    been ordered to make a demarche to a foreign government to promote abortion,
                    which I am convinced is wrong on grounds of basic natural morality, not just for
                    religious reasons. Anyway, I found that tour in INR so beneficial for doing
                    political reporting and analysis, that I concluded every Foreign Service officer
                    specializing in reporting should be required to do two years in INR as an
                    intelligence analyst.</p>
                <p>At the end of my first tour in 1962, because I was a junior probationary officer
                    they were required to send my abroad under the rules. At that time, at least,
                    entering Foreign Service officers were considered interchangeable parts to staff
                    consular positions - at least that's how we viewed it. It didn't matter what
                    your background was, you went out as a visa officer on your first foreign
                    assignment. But they didn't seem to have an assignment for me. Finally, they
                    offered me a choice as visa officer in Liverpool or visa officer in Naples.
                    Well, since they were willing to send me to Italy despite the relatives I had
                    there, I said fine, I'll go to Naples. Who would prefer Liverpool to Naples?
                    Also, Naples would allow me to bring my Italian up to the working level:
                    speaking 3, reading 3, in a range of 5 levels, thus fulfilling the requirement
                    then for promotion: a minimum 3, 3 in one of the so-called world languages.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question before we move to Naples; what was your
                        impression of what assignments they gave the people from the Senior Seminar
                        afterwards? You know - I'm a graduate of the Senior Seminar - and then all
                        of a sudden they say, oh my goodness, you're graduating, and what are we
                        going to do with you? But this was back in the '70s; how did you find this
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I didn't pay particular attention to the onward assignments of
                    senior seminarians - or simply don't remember much about them. I do remember
                    that Carol Laise, who much later became Director General of the Foreign Service,
                    was in one of the classes when I was there. Another, one who was most helpful to
                    me and the one perhaps I admired the most, was directly assigned as our first
                    ambassador to Ouagadougou in Upper Volta; Burkina Faso is the name today. He had
                    started out as a Marine guard, later got into administrative work in the
                    Department, and later worked his way up to deputy assistant secretary with
                    responsibility for the construction of New State. New State had just been
                    completed when he entered the Seminar. New State added three city blocks to Old
                    State. Once he offered me some humorous advice when I expressed my frustration
                    at all paperwork I had to do to satisfy FSI's admin office to get the orders and
                    tickets for the trips the Seminar took. He said, “In a bureaucracy, you do
                    whatever the bureaucrats want you to do, because otherwise you won't get what
                    you need. And then, when you become Secretary of State, you fire the people you
                    found most obstructionist.” But John Thomas who headed FSI's administrative
                    office at the time was really a very nice guy, and helpful - you may have known
                    him...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, John Thomas, I think actually I've interviewed him; I
                        think he was one of the people I interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: He passed away too, of cancer, did he not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I had a lot of dealings with him and we had a good time. As Secretary,
                    I would never have fired John Thomas. Anyway, he went much further than I did in
                    his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, now, you went to Naples and you were there from '62
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Sixty-two to '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's talk about Naples. Who was Consul General and
                        what was the situation like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: When I arrived in Naples Henderson was Consul General on his way out. I
                    never really got to know him. But on his way in was one of the most colorful
                    characters I ever knew in the Foreign Service, Homer Byington III. And he had
                    been born in Naples, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, his father was, you know Consul General in
                        Naples. I mean, it's a dynasty there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. And he had just been ambassador to Malaysia, I believe, but he got
                    what he wanted next; he went back to Naples. He spoke the Neapolitan dialect as
                    well. And I have very pleasant memories of him. In Naples I was on a junior
                    officer rotation; you know six months in this office and six months in that.
                    While I was doing my stint in the commercial section, we were much involved with
                    the construction of his little cabin cruiser, Zio Sam III, Uncle Sam the Third.
                    Then, frequently on weekends, he and his wife, Mrs. Byington, who is a character
                    in herself, would invite an officer or a couple to be their guest on an outing
                    on this boat, down the coast to a little bay, where we would anchor and swim and
                    have a meal pre-packed by Mrs. Byington. As guests we weren't allowed to do
                    anything. I couldn't be part of the crew; she was up on the prow doing
                    everything while he ran the engine. The two or three outings we had with them on
                    that little boat were among the most pleasant experiences we had in Naples.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The big problem was finding a residence for Homer Byington III because the villa
                    that the Hendersons had occupied was for some reason no longer available. Before
                    the Byingtons ended up in the penthouse apartment built over the Consulate
                    General, they rented a place overlooking the bay on the Via Caracciolo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Via Caracciolo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. The house was down on the cliff. To get there you parked on the
                    right of Caracciolo going uphill from the city, took an elevator down to a
                    tunnel which went back under the road to a path on the cliff which led to this
                    house. The problem was that there was a nightclub just up the street, also
                    perched on the cliff. The story goes that on a particularly noisy night Homer
                    went out on his terrace in the wee hours of the morning and shouted, “Silenzio!
                    Silenzio! (Quiet! Quiet!) Both the Byingtons were great persons, and much
                    appreciated by staff, partly because of their idiosyncrasies. Mrs. Byington had
                    the theory that every spouse should become adept at plumbing; she had her own
                    tool kit, and once lectured the spouses on the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Byingtons - were you there when they moved to the
                        penthouse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't believe I was still there when they finally moved to the
                    penthouse. The Byingtons were there forever, until '71 or '72 at least when they
                    retired. For us, I did find an apartment much farther up off Via Caracciolo on
                    the ground floor of a four flat building. We had a small front yard with a view
                    of Vesuvius from our front yard across the neighbor's yard.</p>
                <p>But getting on with what I did. I was on rotation to the various sections, but I
                    spent most of my time as the non-immigrant visa officer. It was depressing; I
                    disliked this work enormously because it was my job, every day, to refuse 60, 80
                    people as non bona fide, ineligible to receive a tourist visa. For example,
                    Luigi, 18 years old, from a village south of Naples would apply for a visa to
                    visit his uncle in Brooklyn who had filed a declaration of support for him. Then
                    you find that Luigi had never traveled anywhere, not even to see Rome. Tourists
                    are not allowed to work. The uncle owns a construction company. It's obvious
                    that Luigi is trying to get into the states to work and become an illegal
                    immigrant. It is such an open and shut case of ineligibility, so you have to
                    refuse it; but at the same time I didn't like to be telling people...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it's no fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: No fun whatsoever. I was almost hoarse, you know, by the end of a
                    morning. And at the same time we were handling immigration visas and there was a
                    lot of fraud involved in applications for first preference, to immigrate as a
                    skilled worker in an occupation in which there were not enough skilled workers
                    in the U.S. I got involved in an INS, Immigration and Naturalization Service,
                    investigation of a lawyer in West Orange, New Jersey, who had set up an
                    operation in Puglia to produce fraudulent affidavits attesting to the skills of
                    an applicant, especially in landscaping and tailoring. This lawyer's chief
                    collaborator was an official in the municipio, city hall, of a little town on a
                    mountain in the region of Puglia. This guy would get local people to sign
                    affidavits attesting to the skills of the applicant as a favor, or for a
                    pittance.</p>
                <p>INS collected hundreds of documents that they were sure were fraudulent, sent
                    them to the INS officer in Naples, and asked him to get proof that the documents
                    were fraudulent. Wohlstenholm as I recall was the name of the INS officer; I
                    really liked him. Well, he got permission to have me as a vice consul to
                    accompany him to this little mountaintop town in the middle of winter. What he
                    had done was gone to the town official who was the center of the ring, and said,
                    “Look, I've got enough evidence to put you in jail if I go to the Italian police
                    on this, but I don't want to do that. What I'd like you to do is call in each
                    one of the persons who signed these fraudulent documents testifying to the skill
                    of applicants, and we will interview them.” He of course complied. My job was,
                    as vice consul, to authenticate the documents so they could be used in a U.S.
                    court. And so for several days we interviewed these people in this cold, humid,
                    dark hall, all of whom admitted to their lying Wohlstenholm sent them all back
                    to INS. INS went to court; this lawyer had his own criminal lawyer front for
                    him, and, as far as I know he was never convicted. But it was a fascinating
                    experience for me.</p>
                <p>When we interviewed immigrant applicants allegedly documented as tailors, we'd
                    ask them to show the palms of their hands. If they had calluses, you knew they
                    didn't come from designing and cutting clothing. We would ask them also to
                    sketch the pattern of a suit coat.</p>
                <p>Another task that I disliked was enforcing the 212(a)(9) provision making
                    candidates ineligible for a crime involving “moral turpitude,” which I think
                    equated with a felony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to insert for the record that 212(a)(9)is a section
                        of the Immigration Nationality Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Thank you. We even had a special office with a full time local employee
                    who did nothing else but obtain criminal records from the police so that we
                    could determine whether an applicant's crimes involved “moral turpitude” and
                    thus made him ineligible for a visa. And then of course there was the exclusion
                    for being a member of the communist party, for which waivers could be obtained
                    only for a visitor's visa. Since the largest labor union, the CGIL, was a
                    handmaiden of the PCI, the Communist party, many otherwise qualified applicants
                    were formally ineligible.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>But I hated to say no. I learned something special about how to handle visa
                    applicants in that job from Gene Zimmerman, who was head of the Visa Section for
                    the initial time I was there. Gene was a seasoned consular officer; and he told
                    me once, if you get a case that you sympathize with, which seems to be a
                    meritorious case, but doesn't seem to fit the regulations, just send it to me,
                    and I will decide it. And later on in Krakow, many years later, that's exactly
                    what I told my vice consuls, that if the case is compassionate and the applicant
                    seems sincere but he doesn't, you know, fit the criteria that are laid out in
                    the regulations - I'm not talking about the law now, but the regulations - well,
                    just send the applicant to me and I'll make the decision.</p>
                <p>In Naples I wish I had followed Gene's advice in one compassionate case
                    especially. There was this guy who was married and separated from his wife; then
                    another woman became what we here would call his common law wife. At this time
                    there was no divorce in Italy. Over the years, decades, they had a number of
                    children. One or the other of these children immigrated to the United States
                    and, gradually, all the children and the mother got immigration visas. However,
                    this guy, the father, was ineligible for an immigration visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he wasn't a legal spouse of somebody who was in
                        the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. So when he applied for a visitor's visa, I, as a new visa officer,
                    turned him down. It was hard to believe that he would return to Italy after a
                    short stay in the U.S., given that his family ties by this time were in the U.S.
                    rather than Italy. It was so compassionate a case. And if I burn in Purgatory
                    someday, it's going to be because of that case. If Gene Zimmerman had gotten to
                    me first, he may have gone; I don't know, he may even have gone later. Anyway,
                    visa work was not the kind of work that I had entered the Service to do, or that
                    I fantasized as doing. I did not, professionally, enjoy my tour in Naples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, I'm a professional consular officer but I found this
                        true with a lot of my colleagues. I mean, it was always a problem. I would
                        agonize, but at the same time I wasn't loathe to circumvent the regulations
                        if I felt there was a compassionate situation, so I shut my eyes or
                        something like that. But I think it's a matter of personality, of people who
                        are or aren't this way. I did notice this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, the way I justified it and practiced it, after some time was:
                    Under the law all the applicant has to do is convince the consular officer that
                    he intends to go for a brief visit and return, and that he would not work while
                    there. And I think that applicants in compassionate cases were bona fide,
                    sincere, when they were talking to me; they had every intention of coming back
                    after a visit. Now, quite a few of them you knew could later be persuaded by
                    their families to stay in the U.S. and apply for a change of status, but that
                    didn't make them an automatic refusal when they applied for the visa. And it
                    didn't make it a mistake on my part when I issued it.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In Poland later on as the Principal Officer, I found out that the young vice
                    consul's practice was to have the visa FSN, our Foreign Service National
                    employee, collect the applications and passports of the maybe 40 people who had
                    jammed into the waiting room that day, some of them having traveled for hours
                    and hours, then quickly flip through them, and decide that most were what he
                    called “statistical refusals.” And then he would have the FSN give them back
                    tell them they weren't eligible for visas. When I found out about that I called
                    him on the carpet. I said there's no such thing as a “statistical refusal”;
                    there are individual people and individual cases. Statistics are only an
                    abstraction; every one of those people should be personally interviewed. And
                    then I told him to send the compassionate cases which didn't seem to meet the
                    criteria in the regulations to me. At this time we were getting lots of
                    congressionals, letters from Congressmen to whom constituents had appealed on
                    behalf of relatives in Poland they had invited to visit. The Department required
                    that we reply to these letters with explanations of the reasons for the refusals
                    within three days.</p>
                <p>There were complaints that the relatives applying for visas had been treated like
                    cattle and what have you. In a communist country I liked to say that one of our
                    greatest advantages was to show that we respected individuals as individuals,
                    and not as members of a herd or group. So I really insisted that every applicant
                    get a fair hearing. But I think I know how the statistical approach originated.
                    If you're a young officer and you have been trained at “Consulate FSI” you are
                    led to think that the regulations are to be applied as the law - I'm speaking of
                    the regulations, the blue pages of the manual, not the law as passed by
                    Congress. I could not see ever deliberately violating a law.</p>
                <p>And I had one very sad experience in this matter. One day as I was doing
                    immigration visas...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In Naples, still in Naples. A woman adopting a child came in with a
                    petition already approved for that child's immigration visa. Our very sharp FSN
                    - they often knew the regulations better than we did - pointed out that the
                    petition was invalid. The law, at least at that time, required that the adoptive
                    parent must have spent six months with the child before the child was eligible
                    for an immigration visa, and she hadn't. She had tried to live with the child in
                    a village for the six months but couldn't bear it. An INS officer apparently
                    took mercy on her and signed the petition. I saw no way I could issue the visa.
                    Next thing I knew, my supervisor, Norm Redden, who had replaced Gene Zimmerman
                    was at my desk and as much as ordered me to issue the visa. Apparently, he had
                    agreed to have it issued with the INS officer who signed it. Neither had said
                    anything to me about it. I said I couldn't but, if he thought the visa could be
                    issued, he could sign it himself. He didn't, at least not then and there, and I
                    don't recall ever learning what happened with the case. At the worst, the
                    adoptive parent could go back to the village and tough out the rest of the six
                    months.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>My refusal to sign the visa certainly didn't help me with Norm Redden when it
                    came time to write my evaluation report. Shortly before I left post, he wrote
                    the annual evaluation report on my performance which I later realized had me
                    leaving the post with knives sticking out of my back, so to speak. At that time,
                    I don't believe rating officers had to show their drafts to the rated officer to
                    get their reactions before filing them. If he did, then what he showed me in
                    draft did not seem that harmful. But I was na�ve about these things then. Some
                    months later in the cafeteria at FSI while in Romanian language training a
                    gentleman came to my table, and asked if I was Carl Bastiani. When I said yes,
                    he told me he had just sat on a panel which reviewed Redden's evaluation, and
                    that the panel had decided in my favor. Otherwise I would have been out of the
                    Service; I was still in probationary status. Norm Redden had made a name for
                    himself in the visa field. He once complained that he couldn't reach me when he
                    needed me. Well, for a lengthy period I was running from one end of the building
                    to the other, between the visa office and the 212(a) (9) office, because the
                    officer assigned was home with a severe case of measles; so I was actually
                    covering two jobs. And it was a traumatic, emotional experience for me, coming
                    out of Naples that way after having worked my tail off for the whole time I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the crime subject, thing, was there any
                        problem with members of the Camorra? The Camorra was the southern equivalent
                        of the Mafia in Sicily. Were there ties to the United States that came to
                        your attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: During my tour, perhaps not being as informed as I should have been
                    about the Camorra, I don't recall that the subject came up.</p>
                <p>We didn't do much political reporting, except at the time of the 1962 elections
                    when the Christian Democrats opened up to the left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Centro-Sinistra, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. They called it the Centro-Senistra to entice the Socialists into
                    an alliance with the Christian Democrats, and wean them away from the
                    communists. These were very important elections because there was a real threat
                    that the communists would gain as a result. Al the Consulate's officers as
                    political officers to go out and interview people to find out what was going to
                    happen. And so we did. We wrote our reports, and contrary to everything we had
                    been told and reported, the communists made a big jump forward as changes in the
                    politics of Italy are measured; always in small steps.</p>
                <p>And then came the order to go back out all those people again to find out how it
                    had happened. I especially enjoyed the political work and commercial work I did
                    in Naples.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I played the major role in the Department of Commerce's exhibit at the Bari trade
                    fair set up one year. It took me to Bari a couple of times with our outstanding
                    local employee in the section to select and photograph the site for Commerce
                    to.</p>
                <p>Also, Cuban missile crisis occurred while I was in Naples; I remember heatedly
                    discussing this with colleagues in the cafeteria. One woman officer, I don't
                    recall her name, said after the Soviets had backed down and were removing the
                    missiles, that there has to have been a quid pro quo, a concession we had made
                    in exchange. I attributed it simply to the fact that the Soviets saw they if it
                    came to an exchange of missiles, God forbid, they were outgunned and would get
                    the worst of it. But later I learned there was a sort of quid pro quo: those
                    missiles in Turkey that we quietly removed.</p>
                <p>And it was through the missile crisis and Adlai Stevenson's too quick willingness
                    to compromise - he was then our Ambassador to the UN - that that I came to
                    realize was a time too when I came to realize that Plato was wrong when he said
                    philosophers should be kings. Intellectuals, people who see too many sides of
                    things, cannot really be good leaders. You need a leader who's willing to take a
                    calculated risk, who does not insist on waiting for overwhelming evidence taking
                    a decision to act in rapidly evolving situation. By that time, it's usually too
                    late. You need somebody with leadership qualities and practical judgment, which
                    is willing to take, as the Italians say, a salto nel buio, a leap in the dark;
                    and Kennedy proved that that was the kind of person he was. Practical judgment
                    is essential. The more academic, the more research oriented, you are to examine
                    all sides of an issue, or anxious to get all advisers to agree, the less likely
                    you are to make a decision when it needs to be made.</p>
                <p>This goes back a little bit to my FSI experience when Dean Rusk was Secretary of
                    State. He was a great Secretary of State. I came to realize that in full only
                    later on when, as a reviewer looking at documents to declassify or not in
                    response to Freedom of Information requests, I went through a whole box of
                    memcons of his conversations, of his t�te-�-t�tes with Gromyko. On Berlin he
                    made clear: you take over Berlin, you will have a nuclear war. He said it in no
                    uncertain terms, on the QT, of course - none of this was said in the press
                    conferences.</p>
                <p>But what really reminds me of Rusk is this point: He was all for reducing what he
                    called layering in the Department which causes delays in deciding anything. He
                    said if a decision on an issue is delayed because of the layered process -
                    getting everyone to agree beforehand, or because we just can't make up our minds
                    - that is a bad decision in itself. But if after looking at it closely, we
                    decide it's best to put a decision off, then that's a good decision. I don't
                    think the layering problem has been resolved to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk a little about life in
                        Naples.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: You mean...</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, how you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: ...The social environment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I mean, this is your first time abroad as a Foreign
                        Service officer, you and your wife, and how did you find Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I think my wife never ceased telling people for the rest of our career
                    that the nicest Italians she ever met were the Neapolitans. They couldn't have
                    been nicer to us. At the same time, of course, Neapolitans have a reputation of
                    being lazy and I recall one good joke they told on themselves. I have come to
                    realize that a people which hasn't yet learned to laugh at itself is still up
                    tight. Neapolitans certainly weren't. A they told me has a Neapolitan sleeping
                    on the sidewalk, his back against the wall, his feet outstretched, when a
                    tourist, an American tourist, comes along looking up with his open guide book in
                    his hands. He trips over the Neapolitan's foot and wakes him up. The American
                    apologizes profusely; but the Neapolitan says no, no apology's necessary;
                    rather, I am in your debt. You did me a favor. I was dreaming that I was
                    working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, when you look at Neapolitans, many of them had
                        two jobs, an official job and the real job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's true, that's very true. The black market, so-called, is a part
                    of the economy that doesn't get into the official statistics, but yet you have
                    to resort to it to explain what you see, how well most people are living.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that you could you make many Neapolitan
                        friends? Or was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No problem whatsoever. The only limitation on making friends was work;
                    I mean, all the time and energy you had to spend working and taking care of your
                    family left little time for much socializing outside the Consulate community. I
                    remember another humorous experience that kind of shows the character of the
                    policemen and their tolerant and friendly attitude towards the Americans. Naples
                    in my time, because of the Sixth Fleet, had about 10,000 Americans all over the
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>One day I was in a hurry to get home and I barged into traffic on Via Caracciolo
                    from a narrow side street without a stop sign. A cop flagged me down. Before I
                    could say anything, he said don't you know that that you must yield to the
                    traffic on Caracciolo, or, like other Americans, are you going to tell me that
                    you don't know this rule? I was dumbfounded. Before I could answer, he simply
                    waved me on. They tolerated us very well. In that time, of course, there was no
                    open anti-Americanism at all - or anonymity. On a trip through southern Italy
                    once, you know, I'm walking through a piazza of a southern Italian town and a
                    guy comes running up to me to say in very friendly fashion, you're the American
                    consular, aren't you? Another thing I noticed about Naples when I was there.
                    There was still some nostalgia for Mussolini.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mussolini, I think, went once to Naples during his time
                        and I think his hat was stolen. And the Pope had never been there, I mean in
                        recent times. Naples was, you know, kind of looked down on by Italians from
                        Rome up. They had a very poor opinion of the whole South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No question about it, even my mother, told me to beware of those
                    Neapolitans; “sono tutti ladri,” they're all thieves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the younger officers; what sort of a group did
                        you have, and what was your impression of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: There wasn't a single one I didn't admire. I think, in my time, they
                    were bringing in really talented, well prepared officers. I saw them either on
                    their first or second tours, John Holmes, for instance; he later became DCM in
                    Rome when I was in Torino. And there was a young officer, his name was Crawford,
                    I believe, who got to know more Neapolitans outside work than anyone. Nobody
                    learned Italian faster than this young officer because he took up with a young
                    lady. If you want to learn Italian, the local Italian in a hurry, that's the way
                    to do it. And this was a very proper relationship, because every time he took
                    her out the young lady's aunt was with them. Good families chaperoned their
                    daughters on dates still at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kennedy make a visit to Naples while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about that a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. By this time I was such an admirer of Kennedy and he was so well
                    received. He was considered, you know, a super person by the Italians. I will
                    never forget watching from a Consulate window the cheering crowds along the
                    sidewalks of Caracciolo as his open car passed. He was idolized, and deeply
                    mourned for a lengthy time after his assassination.</p>
                <p>Italians were also grateful for the economic assistance they got from his
                    administration. About this time the Italian lira was on very shaky ground, so
                    much so that I got an request for help from my relatives - the only time they
                    asked for any favor. A cousin made a special trip to Naples from the family home
                    town in Ascoli Piceno on the Adriatic side, northeast of Rome, with a bagful of
                    lira notes he wanted me to exchange for dollars. Of course I had to refuse, even
                    if I had the dollars to do it. Fortunately, I was able to give him that news
                    that the U.S. was about to grant a two billion line dollar line of credit to
                    Italy that stabilized the lira, and put all the wild fears about the lira's
                    devaluation to rest. And I would add that the Italy for most of the post-war
                    period was our most loyal ally in Europe. In my time, Italians still remembered
                    the 1948 crucial elections when it seemed possible that the Communists and
                    Socialists would win. At this time those parties were close to and assisted by
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Italy going communist would have created an enormous problem for all
                    the other West Europeans. I am really proud of how we helped the anti-communists
                    win in 1948; today a lot of people would call it intervention in violation of
                    international law. We had people going to rural areas supplying food and other
                    necessities well marked as from the United States. We were actively talking to
                    and supporting the Christian Democrats and other pro-Western leaders,
                    financially as well. Many of them stuck their necks way out in the campaign, and
                    would have been finished if they had lost. And the Italians never forgot our
                    assistance under the Marshall Plan which resurrected the European economies.
                    Even as late as the 80s when I was in Torino on my last Italian assignment, that
                    gratitude was still there. And we could always count on the Italians to support
                    us in the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also during the response to the SS-20; over where we
                        could put our counter missiles. The Soviets were putting in intermediate
                        missiles, and the Europeans, Western Europeans were sort of balking at
                        having cruise missiles and Pershing missiles to counter them. But the
                        Italians accepted the cruise missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes indeed.</p>

                <p>Getting back to the visit of Kennedy, I didn't get a chance to greet him
                    personally, but I went to an upper Consulate window that overlooked the main
                    street down which the parade of automobiles came and had a good look at him and
                    the cheering throngs. The picture is indelibly etched in my mind. I believe
                    prior to that Vice President Johnson visited Naples and he I did meet him in the
                    parking lot of the Consulate I have a picture of my daughter number one in
                    Lyndon Johnson's arms. He was well received by the Italians, but with none of
                    the enthusiasm and adulation they showed toward Kennedy. I was still in Naples
                    when Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this would be '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I was there '62 to '64, and it was in '63. Yes, I remember the moment
                    vividly. The outpouring of grief and sympathy as a result of his assassination
                    went on for months. Each of us in the Consulate were going out to this or that
                    town to represent the U.S. at a memorial mass and/or the naming of a street or
                    piazza. I have vivid memories and some photos to show for an elaborate one I
                    attended.</p>
                <p>So, I was there during some historic events, but not a participant. I just
                    witnessed how the Italians responded. We were inspected during my tour as well.
                    By that time I had volunteered for Romania, Embassy Bucharest, and I remember
                    one inspector asking why I wanted to go there. Everybody that goes there, gets
                    divorced or worse. He was very discouraging about life there, but I saw Eastern
                    Europe as a specialty I wanted to develop, and was happy to have been accepted
                    for Romanian language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while were in Naples, was immigration a major
                        industry, as you might say; I mean, for the Consulate General at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed. We had well over 100,000 non-preference registered applicants.
                    The Consulate's rather large basement, was full of file cabinets with visa
                    files. Norm Redden had invented what was called the Montreal System, which
                    reduced all these non-preference files to three by five cards, and he made his
                    reputation there doing this. And so he had out to Naples to clean up the files.
                    He put me in charge of a team of FSNs temporarily employed to go through these
                    files and reduce them to these three by five cards. I hated this job as well
                    because these employees knew that as soon as this job was finished, they would
                    be let go. And I was the guy who was to make sure they did it as quickly as
                    possible. We got it done.</p>
                <p>I liked the commercial work, I liked the political work. I didn't like most of
                    consular work, but, at the same time, developed an appreciation for some aspects
                    of it, like Protection and Welfare. To me it's perhaps the most important of all
                    the consular functions; protecting and assisting American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any cases that stick in mind of welfare and
                        protection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, not there, I didn't get much time in the section. I do have
                    memorable cases from Bucharest and other posts..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come to that. On the commercial side, what
                        sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The big project when I was in the Commercial Section was getting the
                    Department of Commerce's exhibit set up at the Bari trade fair. This trade fair
                    caters to all the East Mediterranean countries, the Levante, as the area was
                    called, and the major function, practical function in commercial work, was trade
                    opportunities, finding companies in Italy which were looking for a U.S. partner,
                    or vice-versa. I traveled twice to Bari, along with our very experienced FSN, a
                    woman, to contract a suitable site in the Fair for Commerce. I made good use of
                    my amateur photography skills on this job.</p>
                <p>Somehow, the most vivid memory I have of Bari was the insight I got into its
                    traditional social environment while eating with the FSN in one of the best
                    restaurants in the center of town. Small tables were arranged along the four
                    walls. At most sat obviously affluent middle-aged or elderly males, each alone,
                    with his back to the wall. No doubt their wives were home, also eating alone or
                    serving other family members. About the only conversation underway was mine with
                    the FSN, the only woman at any table.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Also, while I in the section Pittsburgh Plate Glass dedicated a big new plant not
                    far from Naples in Salerno down the coast. Forschner, the commercial officer,
                    for some reason couldn't go so I accompanied Consul General Byington. My wife
                    came along because Mrs. Byington was ill. After the ceremony, we were escorted
                    to the bar with innumerable options to drink on display. My wife's favorite
                    drink at the time was sherry. Byington asked her what she wanted, and Dorothy,
                    somewhat flustered at the priority given her could only think to say sherry.
                    That's the one drink they didn't have, and with embarrassment chose the first
                    thing offered instead. Well, Byington just thought this was funny - asking for
                    sherry in Italy - and teased her about it in the car on the way back. At the
                    residence he invited us in and went immediately to the bar saying, “Dorothy, you
                    can now have your sherry; you ask for sherry in Spain, not in Italy,” and with a
                    smile pours out a sherry for her. But Dorothy was so embarrassed. Byington liked
                    to tease in this manner; he once did it to me in a similar situation once as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the problems in Naples was unemployment. Alfa
                        Romeo, put in a plant, and they got kids from the farms around there to help
                        build the place. Then when it came time to put in skilled workers the union
                        - the local people - said no, you have to use our kids, you know, the same
                        people who built the plant. In other words, jobs were extremely hard to get
                        and, often recommendations were sought. This made it very difficult for an
                        American firm, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They were almost essential, because it was an employers' market, and
                    people would come to us for raccomandazioni just to get an interview, just to
                    have a hope for getting a job. The way the unemployment situation in the South,
                    the Mezzogiorno, was to a great extent alleviated was by worker migration to the
                    North. Many southerners migrated to the North to work at Fiat and other
                    industrial plants, would marry northern Italian girls and establish families,
                    but retain their attachment to the South. Meanwhile, the northerners who made
                    use of all this labor complained about the investments in the South as a drain
                    on the country's resources. Without these workers from the South, the North
                    would never have been able to develop their industries as they did.</p>
                <p>Some old-timers, told me in all seriousness during my tour in Turin that the
                    stupidest mistake that Garibaldi and Cavour had made when they united Italy
                    under Emanuel- Victor Emanuel II, was to go below Florence; they should never
                    have extended Italy below Florence. This results from the fact that the Southern
                    Italy has a different culture than Northern Italy. Most people don't know that
                    Southern Italy was under the domination of the Spanish for 400 years and gave it
                    a definitely different culture. At the same time Southern Italy was much more
                    exposed to migrations from all over the rest of the Mediterranean.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Normans were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In fact. And so it's been a crossroads of migration.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was Consul General there from '79 to '81, and by that
                        time emigration to the United States was a very minor factor, because most
                        emigration was up to the North or to other parts of Europe; so it wasn't
                        much of a factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: But in my day it was the main business of Consulate. And then in the
                    '80s, I was upset to see them shutting down posts all over Italy, but that's a
                    later story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Now let's talk about 20 minutes your assignment to
                        Romanian language training, and then we'll go on to Romania. How'd you find
                        Romanian? It's supposed to be a little like Italian and Latin. Did you find
                        it was a fairly easy language to learn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: For me it was. In fact, it was so easy that it interfered with my
                    Italian. I had the privilege of being tutored by Nicolai Chiacu. He was the
                    Romanian tutor, absolutely dedicated to forcing you to speak this language
                    whether you liked it or not. I was in a class with just two others and he
                    practiced the oral-audio method exclusively from the first day. Buna dimineata,
                    good morning, Inco data, again, slamming his fist on the table. And he would
                    drill, drill, drill listening intently with eyes closed until he heard you say
                    it exactly. 'Im para bine se va cunosc, pleased to meet you, over and over. He
                    wouldn't tolerate any slow speaking; you'd be sweating by the time you got out
                    of there. I became a total convert to this method of learning a language,
                    because after nine months of Romanian language training, I was speaking it
                    fluently; my only real limitation was vocabulary. And he gave me a grade of
                    four; I thought that was a little exaggerated, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A five is bilingual, four is..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Expert or whatever.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. Every work day I had six hours with him. At this time my wife was
                    home pregnant with our third child; all her pregnancies were difficult and she
                    was in bed most of the day. We had this manual of conversations and exercises
                    based on them conversations which he drilled into memory. The idea was that
                    after six hours of tutoring you would go home and do some more studying of the
                    manual. I never cracked a book when I got home. I was so saturated by the time I
                    got home I didn't look at it; during the last few months anyway, I was doing
                    dinners and household chores besides watching TV with the family.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>And I can tell you a good story regarding a friend's experience with Chiacu. Bob
                    Frowick was my predecessor in INR, Intelligence and Research, and before that we
                    had served together in Bucharest. Bob was in Romanian with Chiacu before me.
                    Over the Christmas holidays he went skiing and broke a leg. While he was in the
                    hospital, Chiacu went every day after tutoring at the Institute to the hospital
                    to tutor Frowick; he wouldn't let him get out of it.</p>
                <p>I learned well too from Chiacu because he would make statements one would
                    consider anti-Semitic. He would say he wasn't, he was only citing facts, just
                    being objective. He wouldn't accept any rejoinder in English. I think he
                    provoked me deliberately to force me to argue in Romanian. He is the best
                    language teacher I ever encountered in my entire life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any feeling about Romania? Often when
                        you're a language student you get an idea from your tutor and maybe other
                        sources before you go out. And this was Romania before Ceausescu, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: He had just come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came in around '67 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: He came in around '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-five.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, after Gheorghiu-Dej.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, What were you picking up about him and from your
                        reading about Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay, we had area studies as well. We knew it was one of the Soviet
                    satellites, totalitarian, but also, well I also learned that it was a country
                    extremely well endowed with resources and beauty. And that reminds me of another
                    joke making the rounds at the time about Romania. When God created Romania he
                    said oh, I'm going to put there the most beautiful mountains with beautiful
                    forests; and leading up to these mountains the most beautiful rolling hills; and
                    a river winding down to a beautiful delta, the Danube River; with marvelous
                    climate and beautiful white beaches on the Black See., St. Michael interrupts
                    and says, “God, you go on with this, Romania will be Paradise on earth.” And God
                    said, “You're right. I know what I'll do; I'll put Romanians there.” Well, you
                    can't tell that joke without insulting any Romanian who hears it; and you can
                    use it to put down any ethnic group you chose by substituting them.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>But you had asked about the Romanian language itself. I learned from Chiacu who
                    is a linguist in his own right, that it is closer to the spoken Latin at the
                    time of the Romans than the Western Romance Languages are. It is very faithful
                    to the orthography, spelling of the words. It is what spoken Latin developed
                    into in the East, as opposed to Western romance languages. At the same time -
                    and this I think I got elsewhere or discovered myself - it is spoken more with a
                    different cadence, and has many Slav words and Turkish words in its vocabulary.
                    You know, of course that the Ottoman Turks dominated the Balkans for about 400
                    years, including Romania. To one who knows Italian, Romanian sounds like a
                    language you should understand, but don't. There are many phrases that are
                    almost identical in meaning; and words that are identical, but with somewhat
                    different meanings. Good evening in Romanian is buna seara, and in Italian,
                    buona sera. Good bye, until we meet again, in Romanian is La revedere; and in
                    Italian, Arrivederci; and so on. I became so immersed in Romanian that I was
                    embarrassed when I would try to speak Italian to an Italian diplomat in
                    Bucharest. I found I couldn't without Romanian popping up. That's how I realized
                    that the social environment is very important to speak fluently in a language
                    you know. At some point during my Romanian tour I flew to Rome for a Conference,
                    I believe. On arrival at the airport, Customs raised a problem with my luggage.
                    Suddenly my Italian came on strong with no Romanian whatsoever mixed in. I was
                    back in the environment in which my buried Italian came up onto my frontal
                    lobes, so to speak.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. This is a good place to start your tour there. You
                        got to Romania when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I got to Romania in 1965, in the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: For about two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this your first exposure to the Communist world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, that is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about the situation. Before we get to
                        what you were doing, what was the situation in Romania in '65, both
                        internally and externally? And after that we'll talk about American
                        interests in Romania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Nicolai Ceausescu had just replaced Gheorghiu-Dej. Gheorghiu-Dej was
                    one of the three founders of the Communist party, and leader of a triumvirate in
                    Romania. He was the chief. Ana Pauker, I don't know if you ever heard of
                    her?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: She was a member, and considered loyal to Moscow. Dej, although
                    originally loyal to Stalin, had long since put Romania on the road to autonomy
                    from Moscow. He set the stage for this by getting the Soviets to withdraw their
                    troops from Romania in 1958, in exchange, I would guess, for the cooperation he
                    gave them in crushing the Hungarian revolt in 1956. I recall reading that he had
                    permitted transit of Russian troops to crush the revolt, and the temporary
                    imprisonment of Imre Nagy in Romania before his trial and execution. Since then
                    he had begun opening up to trade with West, and not cooperating fully with
                    Comecon's Socialist Division of Labor among the satellites. When Dej died,
                    Ceausescu, with the help of other leaders who supported the policy of national
                    autonomy, emerged as the strongman and took over.</p>
                <p>Now, Ceausescu at this time was favored by us because he continued the policy of
                    autonomy vis-�-vis the Soviets. He gained some popularity among the people for
                    it. I characterized him as a nationalistic communist. He was thoroughly
                    Stalinist on how to run the country, but at the same time very Romanian in
                    autonomy toward the Soviets. In defense of it toward the Soviets and its more
                    subservient satellites, he used to the hilt as boilerplate in his speeches the
                    language of the Moscow Declaration of 1957 that socialist countries based their
                    relations on the principles of complete equality, independence, sovereignty, and
                    non-interference in one another's affairs. Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin's
                    crimes in 1956 had opened the way to it.</p>
                <p>At this time toward East Europe, our policy was polycentricism, dealing with each
                    of the satellites as though they were really independent, just to encourage
                    autonomy. The Romanians had clearly shown that they were giving priority to
                    national interests. Ceausescu was actively negotiating to buy modern turn-key
                    industrial technology from the West without a by-your-leave from Moscow. Moscow
                    was doing the same anyway, and could hardly object openly. To pay for this
                    technology he squeezed his own people and exported to the West whatever products
                    were salable, oil and wheat especially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And of course Romania was basically a country full of
                        agricultural bounty; I mean it was a breadbasket.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed. Agriculture was wheat and very much cultivated because of
                    Romania's endowment of fertile land. Western tourism was also very much promoted
                    as an industry to acquire marks, dollars, francs, and other convertible Western
                    currencies. There was a good joke that was told by the Romanians themselves that
                    well characterized the situation. One night it was given to a person to visit
                    hell. There he was wined and dined, and enjoyed himself with every kind of
                    entertainment. So when he got back to earth he thought well, that wasn't bad at
                    all. I could take that for all eternity instead of heaven. Why should I live a
                    good moral life to avoid going to hell. So he lived a very immoral life and when
                    he died was sent straight to hell. When he got there, they immediately slapped
                    on the chains, put a shovel in his hands, stood him in front of a hot furnace
                    and ordered him to shovel coal. He screamed, “What happened? This is not what I
                    found when I was here before.” And they told him, “Ah, but then you were a
                    tourist.”</p>
                <p>That's how the Romanians considered their own situation. They were in a sort of
                    living hell; they were exploited; all the best products were exported. I
                    remember an instance when we had a visiting military attach� or diplomat from
                    Moscow. Now, they were exporting the best not only to the West but found it
                    necessary to export some of it to the Soviet Union for imports they needed. We
                    were discussing what produce and eggs were available on the local market; in
                    Bucharest there were only these little golf balls they called eggs. The best
                    eggs in the diplomatic store in Moscow, said our guests, are imported from
                    Romania.</p>
                <p>The Ceausescu regime even resorted unscrupulously to selling people for money,
                    Jews primarily. There were still many Jews in Romania, and the Israelis were
                    quite willing to have them immigrate to Israel. A system was set up whereby the
                    Israelis paid a price for every emigrant who was allowed to immigrate to Israel
                    via a refugee camp in Italy. There was a price list based on education,
                    profession, sex, what have you. The Israelis paid it. The Jewish emigrants who
                    were processed for exit had all their valuables taken from them. There was a
                    special arrangement with Alitalia to fly them to a refugee camp between Rome and
                    Naples as I recall. From there, some with relatives in the U.S. would opt to go
                    to States or other countries, but most would then continue on to Israel. In my
                    time the estimate was that 25 percent of Israelis were of Romanian origin.
                    Prices were paid also for Germans, though as far as I know, not according to
                    price list. As a result of the war, there were many divided families from ethnic
                    German communities in Romania which had been there for centuries.</p>
                <p>Speaking of divided German families, the most were in East and West Germany. East
                    Germans couldn't travel to the West, but rather easily within the Eastern bloc.
                    West Germans could easily get tourist visas to go to Romania, under Romania's
                    program to acquire hard currency. By pre-arrangement they would meet on the
                    marvelous beaches of Mamaia in Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the East Germans able to slip out and get to the West
                        from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't believe many could. It was simply a way of visiting with each
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the differences as you saw it at
                        the time between our relationship with Tito's Yugoslavia and with Romania at
                        the time? He had early broken with the Soviet Union and we had quite close
                        ties with Tito at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: We, of course, had been supporting Tito economically for a much longer
                    time and in many more ways after he broke with Stalin for the same reasons as we
                    supported Ceausescu. Tito even accepted Marshall Plan aid at a time when he was
                    considered a member of the Soviet bloc. Moreover, in the '60s as Yugoslavia
                    became more liberal internally, this support was much easier to justify,
                    especially after he made his peace with the Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>Tito was also a leader and organizer of the Non-aligned Movement.</p>
                <p>I don't think Ceausescu ever dared join it in its heyday, but he did try to
                    imitate Tito in establishing bilateral relations with just about everybody and
                    anybody on every continent. While the Romanian analyst in INR, the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research, I did a piece in 1970 or '71 I titled “The
                    Peripatetic Ceausescu,” simply listing the many visits to foreign countries he
                    had scheduled over the next six months or so. But I don't think Tito ever got as
                    close to China as Romania did when China and the Soviet Union were openly at
                    odds. They were much more compatible with respect to their domestic policies.
                    Romania I learned while in INR was used as an intermediary by China to send one
                    or two secret messages to us on the issue of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>They had a common border and did collaborate over it. There were ethnic Serb
                    villages in the western Timisoara area of Romania. We have always talked about
                    balkanization in the Balkans, but it wasn't just between countries; it was also
                    within countries.</p>
                <p>During my tour in Romania, I did consular work the first two years or so and
                    economic work the rest of the time. While in the Consular section, I and the
                    economic officer I eventually replaced made a trip with the embassy

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: ...Being a vehicle, a four wheel drive vehicle that could travel these
                    muddy roads in Western Romania, to check out some Social Security recipients.
                    Our Social Security system is very generous in that it pays benefits to anyone
                    who paid into it for the required period, even if they did so as an illegal
                    resident, and then retired to their home country. There is no citizenship or
                    legal residency requirement. When they reached 62 or 65, they could file for it
                    through our Embassy or Consulate. Most countries then and now, I believe, will
                    not pay pensions to their citizens living outside their boundaries - certainly
                    in my time no Eastern European country did this sort of thing. I'm not sure we
                    ever insisted on reciprocity in the matter.</p>
                <p>In Romania, the monthly checks would come to the Embassy for distribution by mail
                    to the recipients. But we began to worry whether some of these recipients were
                    still alive, considering their ages. The receipt we enclosed would always come
                    back signed before we sent the next check, but we were afraid this receipt was
                    signed by some relative or cousin. So we picked out what we thought were
                    potential problem cases and went off to visit them; it was a real education for
                    me about Western Romania.</p>
                <p>You go down a muddy road and you come to a village and every resident was
                    Romanian and spoke only Romanian. You go two miles down the road, you come to
                    another village, and every resident is Hungarian and speaks Hungarian. You go
                    two miles west or two miles north and every resident is German and speaks
                    German. And you went the other direction and you'd have a Serb village and they
                    spoke Serb. They were just fragmented as villages into ethnic groups. I assume
                    the children had to learn Romanian in the local school, but it wasn't spoken at
                    home.</p>
                <p>Well, on this trip we were shadowed by the secret police, and they didn't make a
                    secret of it either. We knew they were in that little car behind us. On one
                    occasion we had gone down a muddy road and visited a woman. Coming back we saw
                    them stuck in the mud. In our visits, the Polaroid camera I brought along worked
                    magic in breaking the ice and getting communication started. You would take a
                    picture and a minute later give it to the subject. One woman was so pleased she
                    begged us to return after the children returned from school to take their
                    picture. In return, almost invariably, they would give us a bottle of homemade
                    tuica, which was triple distilled prune juice, almost pure alcohol. You could
                    put a match to it, you know, and it would just burn until it was gone.</p>

                        alive? I mean, was there a widespread problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, we did not find a widespread problem. In fact I don't recall
                    finding a single fraudulent case on this trip.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In Turkey there were major problems but I'm not saying that I found them when I
                    went out. I don't think we were followed as much, but I used to go out by myself
                    and travel around to areas and do investigations. I always made a point of
                    dropping by the local police and saying I'm the American Consul; can you help me
                    find so and so, and explain what I was doing. I'm sure they called up and
                    checked, but the idea was to let everybody know what I was doing so that you
                    weren't having people wondering what the hell is this guy doing with local
                    police?</p>
                <p>Well, let's take a look at the Embassy. Who was the ambassador while you were
                    there?</p>
                <p>BASTIANI: When I arrived, the Ambassador was William Crawford, but for most of my
                    tour it was Richard Harding Davis, not to be confused with the other Davises who
                    were ambassadors. I must say he was my favorite of all the ambassadors I served
                    under. As a person, he was outstanding. He really looked out for his people and
                    kept up the morale at this post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say this was an embassy kind of under siege? Was
                        it a difficult post or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was a difficult post. The embassy even today is still in the same
                    mansion it took over when it opened after the war. It's walled in and the
                    Romanians always have had their own police outside. In fact, they would
                    intercept people, not even let them come into the Embassy. Because of
                    Ceausescu's autonomy from the Soviet Union, we found that the Soviets were
                    watched about as much as we were. He did not collaborate with the Soviets on the
                    various ministerial levels like most of the other satellites did, all of them,
                    really. Later on I'll have some interesting things to say, I think, about how
                    the relations between the Polish authorities and the Soviet Union were handled,
                    and contrast those with what I am telling you now about the relations between
                    Romanian authorities and the Soviets.</p>
                <p>But at the same time Ceausescu was, already in the 60s, probably more Stalinist
                    towards his own people than the Soviets were then. His secret police were
                    absolutely brutal. We had a Romanian writer employed as an FSN, Alexandru
                    Ivasiuc. He was I assume required to report to the secret police about us, but
                    he was really a dissident knowledgeable about everything, you know, party
                    politics and all the rest. To us he was an invaluable source of information. How
                    he was allowed to be employed as an FSN in our Embassy I don't know, but when
                    Ceausescu came to power, there was a brief liberal period. I'm sure that he was
                    forced to make reports as other Foreign Service nationals. None of them could
                    have worked for us without permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
                    particularly, the secret police, so you had to assume they all reported. At one
                    point he was beaten up, had teeth knocked out.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I don't know when he left the Embassy's employment, it must have been soon after
                    I left in 1968. He obviously remained a dissident, but had several novels
                    published and became a recognized author. He died in 1977, allegedly in the
                    severe earthquake which hit Romania in 1977. I wonder. When I researched him on
                    the internet, I discovered that another Romanian author had died in the same
                    earthquake, but I couldn't find whether he too was a dissident. The secret
                    police of those East European regimes had ways of getting rid of controversial
                    dissidents through so-called accidents. They learned this from the Soviets.</p>
                <p>And then we had an extremely helpful administrative FSN who had been there
                    forever, Rick Samoil. Anything you needed, he would find. Without these people
                    we couldn't have operated. We couldn't hire except through the Diplomatic
                    Service Office of the Foreign Ministry. You couldn't even hire maids except
                    through them. And so we lived in a kind of a fishbowl where we couldn't have
                    contact with the local people. When we arrived - my family and I - we traveled
                    by car, a ship and car. I always maximized per diem on travel to and from post
                    as I could. At this time we had three children, the youngest was only two months
                    old when we brought her from the United States all the way to Romania. After
                    arrival we were put into temporary lodging, an apartment in an building that the
                    Embassy rented through the Diplomatic Service Office. The neighbor in the
                    adjoining apartment was a professor of some sort with a daughter about 17 who
                    was studying English. We liked her and began to use her as a babysitter. Then
                    one day we couldn't talk to them. They had been told not to associate with us in
                    any way. Of course it would have been foolish for us to try; it would have only
                    gotten them into trouble. The only Romanians you could really associate with
                    were the ones who were obviously agents of the secret police. I came to know
                    three or four of them because you'd see them in the major restaurants talking to
                    foreigners very freely. They had no fear whatsoever in doing so, because that
                    was their job. They would even offer to exchange money for you at a black market
                    rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, sometimes in the Soviet Union and some of the
                        other countries, there were times when our relations weren't that great, and
                        the secret police would puncture your tires or rough you up. Was there any
                        of this going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In Romania at this time, no. I personally, and other officers of the
                    Consulate under martial law in Poland did later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't in Romania. How about the young blond girl
                        who all of a sudden says I wonder if you could help me with my English, or
                        something like that. I kept waiting for that; I spent five years in
                        Yugoslavia and it never happened, but in the Soviet Union of course, this
                        is...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: ...I got my approaches, not in person, but when I was the duty officer
                    sleeping in the Embassy. At this time the Embassy did not have direct
                    communications with the Department other than through a dedicated telex line to
                    Vienna. We did not have Marine guards during the first part of my tour, so the
                    male members of the Embassy staff took turns, week by week, sleeping in the
                    secure area of the Embassy where we had a buzzer. If there was a flash telegram,
                    an immediate action telegram from Washington this buzzer would go off and we
                    would then do what was necessary to receive it and get it decoded. We also had
                    to make regular rounds all over the Embassy several times a night to security
                    stations into which we inserted a key to prove we checked. The basement was
                    infested with about the largest cockroaches I ever saw. I always hated to go
                    down there because before you could get to the light you'd hear the crunch of
                    cockroaches underneath your feet. And then they would all scurry when the light
                    came on.</p>
                <p>But, getting back to your original question, two or three times the phone rang
                    while I was on duty, and a sweet voice would come on the line asking whether I
                    was lonely, and try to engage me in conversation. Each time, I simply slammed
                    the receiver down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, could you travel around the country without getting
                        permission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: There were closed areas. We had to get permission to travel to certain
                    areas - I don't remember where they were - of course the travel of our military
                    attaches was what they watched the most. But you know all this security is not
                    just because they were worried about us spying, but because they didn't trust
                    their own people. They didn't want their people to have contact with Western
                    diplomats. This was especially true in Poland under martial law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about consular work. What was consular
                        work? I mean, you talked about investigating Social Security; was there much
                        in the way of visa work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. As in the rest of East Europe, we intervened as we could to have
                    exit visas issued to applicants qualified under our immigration law. These
                    concerned almost exclusively divided families, a spouse or child or parent or
                    sibling of a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant resident wishing to join family in
                    the U.S. In East Europe, this was not just a major consular activity, but we
                    made it political by getting the ambassadors and high level visitors, even
                    presidents to bring these cases up when visiting or hosting leaders of these
                    countries. So we processed immigration visas. There were of course some
                    citizenship cases. If we found a claimant was under our law entitled to a
                    passport, we really went to bat for him or her to get an exit visa from the
                    Romanians. They of course considered such people Romanian citizens under their
                    law. In such cases, you might say that possession is nine-tenths of the law;
                    they had them there. Of course we also processed all requests for diplomatic
                    visas, the so-called A visas, no problem there on the basis of reciprocity. I'm
                    reminded that I once had a visit from couple of their counterintelligence people
                    - they were so obvious - pretending to be interested in traveling to the U.S. I
                    played along, and gave them the information we gave everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the early days in Yugoslavia, before my time, I'm
                        told that these people would come into our Embassy, but they all wore the
                        same type of shoes that were issued to policemen, and shoes were scarce at
                        the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I mentioned this little transient apartment we lived in on
                    arrival; I don't think they'd cleaned the drapes for 10 years and the carpet was
                    filthy. We had a maid of German origin maid who had a terrible time keeping our
                    little Carol from crawling around on the floor,0 because it was so dirty. My
                    oldest daughter came down with a severe case of boils that we had to have an
                    American doctor come in from Belgrade to treat. It was hardship. Well, our own
                    technical security people would come from Frankfurt to sweep the Embassy, and
                    our residences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about sweeping, in that they were looking
                        for bugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They were looking for bugs. In that apartment, they pulled a microphone
                    from the wall between the beds in our bedroom. On the other hand, there was an
                    upside to being bugged. Any time you had an urgent need for a repair service,
                    you complained about it loudly to make sure they picked it up. For example,
                    “We've already had three requests put in to the Diplomatic Service Office of the
                    Foreign Ministry, to repair the plumbing leak in the kitchen, and we've gotten
                    no service at all. They are really inefficient.” And maybe the next day a
                    plumber shows up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many American tourists, and did they have any
                        particular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: There weren't a whole lot, but I did have a couple of interesting
                    protection and welfare cases. One was kind of tragic. One had to do with a
                    Romanian who had come to the United States and become a citizen, and amassed a
                    substantial amount of money; in his old age, having no relatives in the U.S., he
                    returned to Romania where he had some distant relative. After some time he fell
                    ill, became disillusioned with his life there and the relative, and wanted to
                    return to the United States. He had not given up his citizenship, but because he
                    had all this money this relative was supposed to inherit, the Romanians would
                    not allow him to leave the country. He was bedridden with a tube into his
                    abdomen...what do you call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in other words for waste.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: For urine, yes. He wanted to give this money to a charity in the United
                    States. My predecessor had been pushing this case for a long time, and had
                    already helped him to do a new will which bequeathed all his money to the
                    charity. I believe he had even given the Romanians a copy of the will.</p>
                <p>Well, I continued the pleadings, and eventually they finally issued an exit visa.
                    so he could leave because he had dual citizenship. The tragic thing about it is
                    that he never made it back to the United States. We flew him to a hospital in
                    Germany where he passed away.</p>
                <p>The second case is almost unbelievable. There was a young lady who was obviously
                    a mental case. She had been in a mental institution in the United States
                    somewhere in the Midwest, Kansas or Nebraska. Somehow she got it into her head
                    that she had a marriage proposal from Kosygin - I guess he was the Soviet Prime
                    Minister at the time - and she had to go to the Soviet Union to accept this
                    proposal. And I don't know how she managed it, but she flew to London, and then
                    got herself onto a flight to Bucharest. On arrival at the airport she tried to
                    board a flight to Moscow to accept this marriage proposal.</p>
                <p>Well, the Romanians had to restrain her physically; they forcibly put her into a
                    cab, escorted her to the Embassy, and dumped her on us - on me - I was the
                    consular officer. She was obviously exhausted, disheveled, her dress torn at a
                    shoulder, and I get this amazing story from her. At one point she laid her back
                    on the couch and put her feet straight up in the air. Then she tells me that, if
                    she didn't get to Moscow, well, she also had a marriage proposal from the
                    Romanian Foreign minister, and she would accept that instead.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Of course, what I had to do was get her back to the States as soon as possible;
                    this was not a P and W case you could fob off to Belgrade or Vienna. There was
                    putting her in a hotel while we made arrangements. I wasn't going to bring her
                    home to my three children. Fortunately, I had an assistant vice consul, a young
                    lady, who had a kind of circular apartment with an inner sanctum bedroom so to
                    speak which could be closed off. So we put her in this apartment with the vice-
                    consul - Walsh was her name - watching over her. There weren't many Western
                    airlines you could go to at the time, only Austrian Airlines and Sabena as I
                    remember. Fortunately, I had a very good relationship with the Sabena agent. In
                    fact, he's the one who also took my bedridden case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Belgian...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Belgian airline. He accepted her as an escorted passenger all the
                    way to New York where we had arranged through the Department for some
                    institution to take her in hand. I don't recall dealing with any U.S. relatives.
                    The Department did it all. The Romanians, I'm sure, were happy to see her go. In
                    any event, from the time they dumped her on us, she was not violent in any
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the economic side, it must have been kind of
                        dismal reporting these administrative shortages. You know, the place was
                        almost a basket case, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was a basket case for the local people but not for us. The thing
                    about being in the Foreign Service abroad is the U.S. Government really takes
                    care of you, almost too much to my mind. We are so well taken care of. and we
                    have the best of both worlds.</p>
                <p>So how did we solve that problem in Romania? Well, the ambassador was entitled to
                    his own transportation. Periodically, he would arrange to have a C-130, the big
                    Air Force cargo airplane to come from Frankfurt to pick him up. In advance,
                    every American on the staff put in his shopping list for Commissary and PX items
                    to a sergeant there who moonlighted filling these orders. And all these orders,
                    identified by name, would go onto this C-130, you know, meat, everything,
                    cereal, just as you would shop in a supermarket, or at Macy's to the extent the
                    PX had what you wanted. The Air Force loved to do these trips, because it gave
                    their pilots experience flying over East Europe. At the airport, the plane would
                    park along the fence near the terminal, and our trucks would load directly from
                    it while a Romanian Customs official walked back and forth with his hands behind
                    his back - as I once observed. The orders were delivered directly to the homes.
                    Most of us had an extra freezer.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The other line of supply food from the West was Ostermann and Peterson, a Danish
                    or Dutch company. They used to run a truck to Bucharest about every two weeks,
                    and my wife and I bought these big beautiful eggs from them, six dozen at a
                    time. It's amazing how long eggs will keep if refrigerated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Carl, what about the economic statistics and all?
                        What were we interested in? How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Romanians, of course, put out their official statistics. The
                    Agency, the CIA and INR, State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research in
                    Washington had figured out that they were falsified, over or under by a factor
                    of about 10 percent. They had to have numbers which were reasonably consistent;
                    you can't run a country without them. And the U.N. was always asking for them.
                    So we used their statistics a great deal in our reporting as corrected at times
                    by our own people.</p>
                <p>When I switched from consular to economic work about midway in my tour, I found I
                    couldn't go out to talk to people at all. I couldn't go out to a factory and
                    talk to them; I couldn't even talk to an official in an economic Ministry. Every
                    meeting had to be arranged officially through the Diplomatic Service Office, and
                    most of the time you got no reply whatsoever. In order to try to prime the pump,
                    so to speak, I requested a meeting with someone in their Ministry of Minerals or
                    Mines for the purpose of presenting our Department of Interior's two volume
                    publication on the world's mineral resources. It waand probably still ia world
                    authority on the subject. Of course, in the U.S. the Department of Interior does
                    not correspond to Ministries of Interior in the rest of the world which are the
                    police. I did finally get a reply to our Note requesting the appointment,
                    setting up a meeting. Well I went over, made the presentation, go no information
                    in return, and that was the end of our relationship.</p>
                <p>If we wanted to invite Romanian officials to a dinner, we would have to send the
                    invitations through the Diplomatic Service Office and often not know who was
                    going to show up until the last minute. You knew they couldn't come unless they
                    had permission, and you just could not establish a personal direct relationship
                    if they did. The only people outside our own community you could establish
                    personal relationships with, of course, were other foreign diplomats. And so we
                    all lived in a sort of a fishbowl; you would go frequently to receptions at
                    other embassienational day receptions were happening all the time, and we
                    diplomats were seeing each other all the time. At one, I remember I wanted to
                    punch a particular Swede in the nose one day, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, this was the time in the mid '60s when the Russians were way
                    ahead of us in space, Sputnik and all the rest. Meanwhile our very open rocket
                    program was having one failure after another. This Swede was openly
                    anti-American and pro-Soviet, and was rubbing it in to me when we got on the
                    subject of space programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, you're talking about punching...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I said, Kennedy had committed us to going to go to the moon by
                    1969, and we would get there first. He just laughed and I got the urge. We'd
                    each had a couple of drinks, which probably had something to do with it. Anyway,
                    I've often wished</p>
                <p>I'd kept his name or some way to get in touch with him when we landed on the moon
                    to send him a message.</p>
                <p>You know, when you're going to so many receptiononce to three on the same
                    eveninyou have to watch yourself, and I developed this technique. My drink then
                    was Scotch and soda and I would start with one and drink it slowly, then I would
                    have a coke or a mineral water, and then another Scotch and soda. And when I
                    lost count I quit. It worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With me it was one Scotch and water, double Scotch, and
                        then after that ginger ale. You know, you had to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: You had to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think most people do because it's a working
                        occasion, these are not cocktail parties just for fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: For me not in Romania and Poland. I sometimes found that when I was
                    being entertained by the other side, they were out to get me drunk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: But I managed to avoid that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any contact, almost sort of mutual suffering
                        with the Soviet diplomats, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I keep getting Poland and Romania a little mixed up. But no, in
                    Romania, as far as I know, we didn't have any contact at all with Soviet
                    diplomats. I certainly didn't.</p>
                <p>And I don't think it would have sent the right message to the Romanians who were
                    watching us both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But of course, to somebody who's not familiar with the
                        situation during the height of the Cold War, there were no Soviet troops in
                        Romania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's right. And Ceausescu did everything to make sure they never came
                    back. He was quite good at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the general reading that you were getting
                        at the Embassy of Ceausescu and Madame Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: OK. Of Madame Ceausescu, to my departure in 1968; she had not yet
                    emerged as a co-ruler. Because of Ceausescu's autonomy vis-�-vis the Soviet
                    Union we favored hiyou know that old diplomatic saw: the enemy of my enemy is my
                    friend. So early on we gave Romania most favored nation treatment to encourage
                    direct trade between us. I told you he was after modern turnkey technology.
                    Well, as one German representative of a company remarked, “Just because you put
                    a Steinway piano in a house, doesn't mean you're going to get good music out of
                    it.” He doubted that the Romanians could run these plants. But Ceausescu would
                    not accept secondhand technology; he was always looking for the latest. His way
                    of running the Party and the country was to select able people loyal to him,
                    people who were as equally ruthless as himself in getting things done.</p>
                <p>On the economic side, I remember we had an organized visit at one point to
                    Ploesti, oil producing area north of Bucharest at which I got to converse with
                    some Romanian economic officials. It had to do with a potential deal between an
                    American oil or oil equipment supply company.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>And Ploesti reminds me of the one and only occasion on which we mixed socially
                    with Romanians, when my wife and I were guests at a large open air wedding
                    celebration amid the beautiful vineyards on the foothills of the mountains north
                    of Ploesti. We had previously witnessed the wedding itself in a Romanian
                    Orthodox church done with full liturgy and chants. The vineyards had been
                    confiscated from the family of the bridthey may have retained some formal title
                    to them. We had a marvelous time conversing, and even trying to dance at the
                    banquet. The story about me my wife liked to tell was that when a small
                    cockroach came out from leaves of lettuce on my plate, I simply pushed it aside
                    and kept eating. I didn't want to embarrass the hosts by calling attention to
                    it. Dorothy had a phobia for any kind of insect. I'm still trying to recall how
                    we got invited; it must have been through our marvelous visa FSN, Ms. Gane,
                    whose first name slips my mind at the moment.</p>
                <p>The Romanians we associated with on a daily basis, of course, were the local the
                    FSNs. Ms. Gane had been the daughter of the chief of police prior to the war. I
                    believe she still held formal title to the mansion she inherited, but she was
                    confined to a small former servant's room in which to live; the rest was
                    inhabited by Romanians who were given residence there by the authorities,
                    presumably persons loyal to the Party. But it hadn't broken her spirit; she was
                    a cheerful and charming person, and extremely skilled in our visa procedures.
                    The other was also skilled and efficient, but I suspected the one who reported
                    to the Secret Service. You had to assume they were all forced to report. But she
                    too I felt was as loyal as I felt she thought she could be, and efficient in our
                    passport procedures. And we learned so much from them about what was going on in
                    Bucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the mistakes that people outside make. At
                        one point I think Congress said get rid of all Foreign Service National
                        employees in the Soviet Union, and put Americans in. It put us at a
                        tremendous disadvantage becausthough we knew that in communist dictatorships
                        they had to reporthese people saw how open were, and eventually it caught
                        on, and they reciprocated. And you learned so much more from them than if
                        you had Americans only working for you, Americans trying to deal with the
                        public when they have no idea what's going on in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes indeed... For recreation, the Embassy leased a large home in
                    Sinaia, a ski and winter sport resort in the mountains north of Bucharest, near
                    Brasov. The American staff paid for the lease, and we took turns going up there
                    on weekends with our families. It had belonged to an official to the king, his
                    personal secretary if I recall correctlthe king's mountain castle was located
                    therand was big enough for two families to go up together. That's were our older
                    daughters were introduced to skiing. These excursions are also happy
                    memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether our economic Counselor in Belgrade
                        when I was therthis was say '62 to '6who talked about Cleveland setting up a
                        golf course there ever succeeded. Was there a golf course in Bucharest while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: There was indeed. There was the one-third remnant of a full pre-war
                    golf course bordering on a lake. All that was left were six holes though before
                    I left they were adding three more. The rest had been nationalized and turned
                    into farmland and/or a public park. There still existed a golf club known as the
                    Diplomatic Golf Club, with an excellent professional, Paul Tomita, who gave
                    lessons. We'd play the six holes three times around to get our 18 hole scores.
                    On those six holes, on certain fairways you would encounter a flock of sheep; I
                    guess that's how I guess they mowed the fairways. For fertilizer, I guess, the
                    sheep left little black stuff in their wake which got on your balls.</p>
                <p>You couldn't play alone; you couldn't carry your own bag, let me put it that way.
                    There was a group of caddies, who would assign one of their number to regular
                    players. I was assigned this woman caddie, I didn't pick her. As soon as I
                    showed up at the golf course on the weekend, she would emerge from the group
                    pick up my bag, and off we'd go.</p>
                <p>Well, I was a lousy golfer. I refused to take lessons. I overswang; I guess I
                    used golf there as a way of releasing my stresses rather than working at it to
                    improve my game. Anyway, at one point my caddie became pregnant, and she was
                    getting bigger and bigger and bigger around the middle. I'd slice the ball into
                    the bushes and say, forget it, forget it; I'll play another ball. I kept
                    worrying that she was going to need delivery assistance on the course. She was
                    have caddied for me practically to the day of delivery. She disappeared for a
                    week or two. I knew from the other caddies that she had given birth. When she
                    reappeared, Dorothy, for the next weekend or two a few weeks Dorothy would load
                    me up with a bag of baby clothing for her. We had it in abundance. That golf
                    course was such a boon to those of us who played. Of course, our military
                    attach�s were the best golfers among us. I used to like to watch them play. I
                    imagine that was true at most of our Embassies which had access to golf
                    courses.</p>
                <p>Later on I heard that the Clubhouse, which was a beautiful wooden structure had
                    burnt down and then that the whole course got taken over. But we used to brag
                    that we had the only golf course between Western Europe and Taiwan. Businessmen,
                    especially the Japanese used it. It seemed the first thing they would do after
                    checking into a hotel was come out to the course and swing away. I mean that
                    literally. I once watched one miss the ball three times in a row on the first
                    tee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left there, you left about when...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I left in '68 I left. I was there from about the middle of '65 to
                    August '68.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: We had the coordinated, worldwide demonstrations against our policy in
                    Vietnam with the same slogans showing up in Bucharest as in Warsaw, and Berlin;
                    the Soviets and North Vietnamese were good at getting these demonstrations
                    staged against our intervention in Vietnam. They were not spontaneous. They were
                    always controlled; you know; there was always a limit on how violent they could
                    be; how much they could throw at us. It was a ritual; it but it wasn't the
                    people protesting; it was the party, the authorities who staged them to show
                    their solidarity with their Vietnamese comrades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any high level visits, Americans
                        coming...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I think I mentioned that my first job in INR in 1969 the day I
                    reported there was to do the first draft of the briefing book for President
                    Nixon's visit in August, which had been announced on the weekend. That was about
                    two years after I left Romania. I remember vividly the moment when I heard the
                    news on the radio while sitting in my living room. In my time we had a Secretary
                    of Commerce visit with his retinue. And there were more. The Romanians really
                    rolled out the red carpet for this sort of thing, given the priority they were
                    giving to the purchase of turnkey plants.</p>
                <p>Mention of turnkey plants reminds me that I had a death case to deal with while
                    in the Consular Section in connection with one of them. An American
                    engineer/executive from Corning had come over to close a deal for a plant or
                    advise on one already under construction in Northeast Romania. There, in their
                    usual fashion the Romanians were wining and dining him, when he had a fatal
                    heart attack.</p>
                <p>They notified us immediately and offered every cooperation. I think they were
                    really worried that that we were going to blame them for this guy's death, and
                    interfere with this deal. So they almost insisted that a consul go there
                    immediately to do the consular thing. It was quite an experience. I flew on a
                    local Romanian airliner. It was the Soviet made version of our C-47 or DC-3. I
                    sat near an open door in the back. There were mail bags thrown on the seats in
                    front of me. And because of the overcast it flew at a low altitude, just
                    clearing the hills. I no sooner got there than they rushed me in to observe the
                    autopsy from start to finish, you know, with gown and mask. I think they had
                    delayed the start for my arrival. And I had no doubt that this had been an
                    honest to gosh heart attack. He had a heart condition for which he carried a
                    nitro-glycerin medication.</p>
                <p>And then, of course, it was my job to write that letter to his wife in the
                    States, and arrange shipment of the body to the States. The widow couldn't have
                    been nicer in her thanks to the Embassy for what we did. It was another case
                    that proves that protection and welfare work is about the most interesting
                    consular work you can do abroad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened then? You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In the summer of '68. By that time I had been reassigned to Washington
                    to the Special Exchanges Office. This was a little office in EUR, the Bureau of
                    European Affairs which handled exclusively cultural exchanges with the Soviet
                    Union and the satellite countries. The Embassy got into a tug of war with the
                    Department over me. EUR's personnel office wanted me there like yesterday, and
                    the Embassy said it had no one to replace me until later in the summer. The end
                    result was that the 4-6 weeks of home leave I was entitled to had to be
                    postponed, and I reported to work in Washington within ten days of arrival. I
                    just had time to ship the family off to Grand Rapids, Michigan to stay with my
                    wife's parents, and search look for a home in the area. That's a story in
                    itself.</p>
                <p>In SES, I was the desk officer for Poland. There was no overlap at all. My job
                    was to process requests for J-2 or so-called Fulbright visas for the rather
                    numerous exchange visitors from Poland, and also handle requests for waivers
                    from the J-2 requirement that the visitor return to his own country for at least
                    two years, before he could apply for an immigrant visa to the United States.
                    This provision was put into the regulations because the purpose of the program
                    was to train people who would then return to their countries to apply the skills
                    learned here; also to promote understanding of in these countries of American
                    society and arts. In the physical sciences, it was a sort of aid program with
                    Third World countries. The Soviet bloc countries obviously exploited it to have
                    scientists in sensitive fields from a Defense security point of view
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>I would circulate the requests for approval to issue the visas to any government
                    agency which had an obvious interest. A university or research institution may
                    have already accepted them on a provisional basis. The CIA was interested in
                    reviewing everybody, and DOD, the Defense Department, anyone from the Soviet
                    bloc coming to work in a hard science or mathematics, and usually with good
                    reason. However, we did have the power to overrule objections , in the rare
                    cases we saw their concern was excessive.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Now, I didn't particularly value that job but I liked it, because I got all the
                    daily take from Poland and about Poland in my in-box, every report sent in by
                    the Embassy in Warsaw and those in other countries of Eastern Europe, as well as
                    cables sent to Poland and Eastern Europe from the Department. It was a real
                    education on developments in Eastern Europe, and our relations with Poland in
                    particular. However my job was limited to requesting and coordinating clearances
                    from other agencies on applicants from Poland for exchange visitor visas, the
                    J-2 visa, and then authorizing the issuance or denial of the visa. It quickly
                    became a routine procedure. More interesting were the requests for adjustment to
                    immigration status from exchange visitors in the U.S; that is, for a waiver of
                    the J-2 requirement, that visitors return to their home country after the
                    completion of their program, and remain there for at least two years before they
                    could apply for an immigration visa. The explicit purpose of the exchange
                    visitor program was to advance the skills of applicants in their field which
                    they would then apply in their home country. In this matter, I had almost
                    exclusive authority to grant or deny the waiver. Our regulations were strict in
                    the matter, allowing a waiver only if the case could be made that an applicant
                    would probably suffer persecution on his return, or if strong compassionate
                    circumstances existed.</p>
                <p>And I had one famous case; concerning a Polish scholar of Shakespeare, Jan Kott.
                    He had written a book that was internationally esteemed, Shakespeare Our
                    Contemporary. He came to the States on an exchange visa taught at Yale, and
                    California, and, I think Harvard as well. He not only taught literature, but
                    participated in the protests rampant at the time in academia against our
                    intervention in Vietnam. He write and producing an anti-Vietnam play in which
                    the student actors performed on stage in the nude. He applied for a waiver to
                    adjust his status as an immigrant and accept employment on the faculty of the
                    University of California, claiming that he would likely suffer persecution or
                    hardship if he returned to Poland. I saw no justification for this claim; in
                    fact, by actively supporting protests against our intervention in Vietnam, he
                    was doing here exactly what the Polish regime was doing internationally. Prior
                    to his arrival in the U.S., he had in Poland ingratiated himself with the Soviet
                    mercenary regime as a creative proponent of “socialist realism,” the communist
                    theory of the arts.</p>
                <p>I could find no justification whatsoever that he would suffer any hardship if he
                    returned to Poland. And so I turned him down. Shortly thereafter, my office
                    received two appeals for a reversal of the decision from the highest levels of
                    the Department, one originated with the Johnson Administration's cultural czar,
                    and the other came through the Rostow brother who was then, I believe,
                    Undersecretary for Political Affairs. The Rostow brothers were prominent
                    Democratic Party supporters in the academic community. I don't recall that
                    either appeal provided any evidence or argument to support the claim; they were
                    just requests for a reversal of the decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Of course, normally, any request from on high in the Department is viewed as a
                    command. My two supervisors in the office, the Director and his Deputy, merely
                    passed them on to me. Neither, I recall ordered me to approve the waiver. I
                    maintained the refusal. They could have simply overruled me and approved the
                    request, but they didn't, even though I'm sure they wish I had. I took that to
                    mean they knew I was on solid ground under the law and regulations.</p>
                <p>But that didn't end the matter. I assume they merely held the requests in
                    suspense, because I no sooner transferred to a new job in the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research than my successor approved the waiver as one of his
                    first acts. So Jan Kott did get his waiver; I had only delayed it.</p>
                <p>While reviewing all the take from Poland at this timwe are talking now about the
                    late '6I began to wonder what was going in our Embassy. I was a sort of cold war
                    warrior, and commented sarcastically that it seemed on any issue between the
                    U.S. and Poland, our people would go to the Foreign Ministry, ask what they
                    wanted them to tell the Department, and make that their recommendation. I saw
                    this as a form of “localitis,” in which you want so much to promote relations as
                    a diplomat that you end up working more for the other side than our side.</p>
                <p>I don't know if you ever heard this one about the reason why we don't leave
                    people longer than three years in one post: The first year on the job you work
                    for your government; you pursue the interests of your own government. The next
                    year you push the interests of the other government; that's called “localitis;”
                    and the third year you work for yourself. I got the impression that some of
                    localitis was occurring, especially in our cultural relations for which USIA,
                    the United States Information Agency, was responsible. Within the U.S. its name
                    was the United States Information Agency; abroad it was the United States
                    Information Service, USIS. Congress, for domestic political reasons, barred it
                    from including the American people as a target in its promotion of U.S. policy.
                    It no longer exists. It was incorporated years ago into the Department of State
                    as the Bureau for Public Diplomacy, which I think was a mistake.</p>
                <p>On the Polish side, there were these fellow-travelers in the cultural field who
                    allowed themselves to be used by the regime without joining the Party.
                    Unfortunately, in Poland which was domestically liberal in comparison with
                    Romania or Czechoslovakia after 1968, you could not advance in your field in
                    academia or the media without authorization from the regime. Some compromised
                    themselves willingly; most, I suspect, reluctantly. Anyway, these were the
                    people most accessible to our USIS officers, who cultivated them as contacts. I
                    remember once getting a request from a USIS officer from Warsaw for the urgent
                    issuance of a visitor visa for one of his contacts, a journalist then on a visit
                    to Canada. The request was to have the visa issued at the border by way of
                    exception on a weekend. This Polish journalist too had a reputation of
                    lambasting the U.S., especially over Vietnam. I saw no reason to ask our
                    Consulate to have their duty officer go down and issue this visa on an emergency
                    basis, so I denied it.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>At the same time, I don't mean to imply that I thought that the Embassy was
                    manipulated in all of the recommendations it made on policy. They were promoting
                    a lot of things which supported our general policy of “polycentrism,” and
                    benefited the Polish people, especially in trade. The PL-480 program, Public Law
                    480, is perhaps the best example. Under it, the U.S. sells grain, accepting
                    payment in the local currency which cannot be converted to dollars. We then use
                    it to pay expenses of our Mission within the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And paid for in local currency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: And paid for in local currency. It's actually a form of aid, because we
                    accept the official, unfavorable rate of exchange. I never disagreed with the
                    PL-480 requests strongly supported by the Embassy, and was disappointed when
                    Washington refused some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Polish desk in the
                        European bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, indeed. However, the desk almost invariably supported whatever the
                    Embassy recommended. They, I think quite rightly, coordinated all Embassy needs
                    and requests with other offices of the Department and other agencies. The
                    country desk is the highway, so to speak of all the Embassy's relations with
                    Washington. But while in the Special Services Office, I had no need to work
                    closely with them. In my next job in INR, Intelligence and Research, I worked
                    much more closely with the desk, more at their initiative than mine; they saw
                    INR as a resource.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at it as a practical measure, I think
                        probably one of our most successful programs has been the exchange program,
                        because the United States is infectious. People come here from other —
                        particularly communissocieties and other dictatorships, and they see our
                        open society. Despite all its faults and problems and its many critics, it's
                        an eye opening to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I couldn't agree with you more. In fact, especially in Italy, I really
                    did my best to find and recommend influential applicants for exchange visas I
                    thought would benefit from this eye opening experience. In my last tour, Torino,
                    I got the mayor, a socialist, then in alliance with the Communists, an exchange
                    visitor visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand we're having very difficult relations right
                        now with the, well, I won't say the Soviet Union, but the Russians, I heard
                        somewhere that 10 percent of the Duma, which is a rubber stamp outfit, have
                        been on exchange visas to the United States. This is going to pay off
                        eventually.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: It does and it will; there's no question about it. Our strongest asset
                    is our open democratic society. Long ago I formulate“subscribed to” might be the
                    better terthe theory that there were three legs of international power:
                    military, economiof course, these two reinforce each otheand political power in
                    its broadest sense, the attraction of our open society which puts individuals
                    first, not groups. It has enormous appeal. There's no reason for me to be
                    lecturing like this here, but that's the way I am; my daughters say I never
                    stopped since leaving the Seminary. We're the oldest democracy in the world, and
                    the whole world has been imitating us.</p>
                <p>One of the things about the Polish people is that they were just as democratic as
                    us back around the time of our Revolution. Some of them came over to help us in
                    the war. Their democratic movement was crushed by their more powerful neighbors,
                    but we won, and have been favored ever since. We are favored, because we're a
                    nation of immigrants, attracted by our free society. Most people everywhere want
                    the same things, to make a better life for themselves and their families. And as
                    long as we maintain this culture, these ideals, we have nobody to fear,
                    really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a problem right now; we've had an administration,
                        Bush II administration, which has been a real problem. I mean, it has
                        undercut many of our values, say to fight terrorists, overplaying this, but
                        we're coming back, you know, it happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's getting into current politics. Some day we could have a separate
                    discussion about the Bush years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well, I'd like to stop at a good cutting place. You
                        left this exchange program... I might explain that you would think that this
                        exchange program would have fallen within the purview of the U.S.
                        Information Agency in Washington, but I think it was Fulbright who insisted
                        that it be in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so that's why it was not a bad idea, because we are
                        able to, you know, bring the political element in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: However, later on the Special Exchanges Office in EUR was eliminated,
                    and its functions taken over by the Bureau of Cultural Affairs. I don't know
                    when it went out of existence, but it wasn't too many years after I had served
                    there. This would probably be a good place to break, but what happened while I
                    was still there is that a friend I mentioned earlier, Bob Frowick, who was then
                    in INR, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, had wrangled himself a choice
                    assignment to which he couldn't go, unless the personnel officer in EUR could
                    find a replacement for him. They offered the job to me, and I jumped at it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick this up in...this is 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Sixty-nine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '69 you moved to INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, I had only spent about a year in the Special Exchanges Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick it up then. Okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I even began to speculate or analyze the meaning of the words we
                    used in our intelligence briefs. For instance, the word that came up constantly,
                    especially in the output of the Soviet office, was “may.” What does “may” mean?
                    For example, the Soviets are selling missiles to Egypt; this could be for four
                    different reasons, each listed as a “may” as the purpose for the policy makers
                    to choose from. If the intelligence analyst doesn't know which reason it was,
                    how can the one responsible for reacting to the Soviet move? Does it mean 50/50
                    probability, or more likely than not likely? In this particular piece I don't
                    recall that they listed them in order of probability. You know, there's a huge
                    difference between possibility and probability. And in my academic work in
                    philosophy I had really focused on probability because anything is possible that
                    is not self-contradictory. So I couldn't see that kind of writing as useful to a
                    policy maker.</p>
                <p>Policy makers, the guys who have to call the shots in the bureaus; they really
                    need good intelligence analysis. They don't have time to do all this research,
                    and I didn't think we were fulfilling our mission in INR very well with the way
                    we hedged and fudged. You got the impression that a report would never come up
                    with a definite or highly probable conclusion, unless it was already
                    obvious.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>This is what was going on in my time. In this work, we never have all the facts,
                    but on the basis of what we do have, we have a working hypothesis which we carry
                    forward day after day as more data becomes available until we where you can say
                    it's highly probable that this is what they are up to. Of course you don't want
                    to blow your credibility; you don't want to predict something, and then find out
                    that you are wrong. So you hedge when you aren't sure. But being wrong in some
                    cases need not hurt you, if you are the most knowledgeable person on a subject.
                    In fact, Hartman; is that his name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Art Hartman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: He was in INR in 1968 and had assured the White House that the Soviets
                    would not go into Czechoslovakia to crush Dubcek's Prague spring. But shortly
                    thereafter, when Kissinger became Nixon's national security advisor, he went to
                    the White House as Kissinger's man for East Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you can't be sure, but I think this has been one of
                        the great criticisms of the Central Intelligence Agency in that it seems to
                        be almost a straight line of conventional wisdom. I have my own little
                        philosophy on this. If you're talking to the President every day you can't
                        say, “Gee, I think the Soviet Union may fall.” You know, you can't speculate
                        very much as the Principal Advisor to the President; whereas in the State
                        Department, you know, there are real indicators that something might be
                        going on here or there, and it doesn't gain notoriety, though, of course,
                        everything leaks. And people I talked to have not found the CIA overly
                        useful. These are bright people. But I think it's too big, and the more
                        layering you have the more they tend to modify. I mean in other words,
                        analysts can't get out of line. I imagine you might have observed that in
                        the Vatican and the Church, a big organization like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It's common to any large institution, I think. It's how human nature
                    reacts within an institutional environment. You know, the one principle I set on
                    quite early in analyzing is you must try to see what's true, not who's right. So
                    if you only have “what's true” as your objective you're going to err far less
                    often than when your vision is complicated by sentimental loyalties to your
                    office's position, or you have too much concern for your relations with your
                    boss because he happens to have a different view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in INR you were dealing with two, really dictatorial,
                        autocratic and rather peculiar people in Albania and Romania, Ceausescu
                        and... how do you pronounce his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Hoxha.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hoxha. But did you find the fact that these were sort of
                        freewheeling types, I would think more freewheeling than you'd have coming
                        out of the politburo types in the Soviet Union where, I mean, it was really
                        a joint operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: You're right. Both of these maximum leaders were more like Stalin. They
                    ran things; everybody else kowtowed to them, because it was dangerous, even
                    physically dangerous, to contradict. Whereas, from the time of Khrushchev, it
                    was much more of a collective leadership in the Soviet Union. Not of the entire
                    politburo; the politburos of all these countries included token representatives
                    of businessmen, women, what have you, with no real influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Minorities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Minorities, etcetera. But there was an inner core which collectively
                    wielded all the power. I can speak much more to that subject when we get to
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I'd like to speak to these two because these are
                        rather peculiar countries; they weren't very vital to anybody but at the
                        same time I would think that you would sort of find one or the other leader
                        sort of running off at the mouth or revealing things that probably wouldn't
                        happen say in the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. Well, with regard to Ceausescu, he disliked, hated the Russians. I
                    heard different stories, but one was that as a young, upcoming Romanian leader,
                    while in Moscow for training he was beaten up by Russian colleagues. In fact he
                    spoke with a sort of a lisp, and people attributed it to the fact that he had
                    had his jaw broken by roughnecks in Russia. At the same time, as the national
                    leader he had a lot of guts.</p>
                <p>Another story I heard is that on one of those usual consultations in Moscow
                    Brezhnev held with individual satellite leaders, Brezhnev was upbraiding him for
                    breaking ranks on trade with West Germany or whatever. “How dare you? And
                    Ceausescu said, “This is how.” He got up, walked out of the room, went straight
                    to the airport, and flew back to Bucharest. The autonomy was real; and I was a
                    good analyst on Romania because I saw that, and in my reports showed how he
                    demonstrated it.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>And we at the same time, this is when they began to talk about polycentrism in
                    Eastern Europe where we would deal with each of these East European countries as
                    much as possible directly. The aim was to loosen their ties with the Soviet
                    Union. The Soviets had this grand plan for the Socialist Division of Labor: this
                    country specializes in this industry, that one in another and so forth in the
                    Comecon. Soviet post-war policy in East Europe was really in a way a reflection
                    of our own policy. We found it necessary to found NATO, and then they founded
                    the Warsaw Pact. We organized NATO, or the Europeans organized among themselves
                    the Common Market, and they organized Comecon. The difference was that in the
                    West, this was all voluntary, whereas in the East it wasn't; also that we wanted
                    countries across the curtain to deal with each other directly, especially in the
                    economic sphere, and they wished to control it from the center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'd started this polycentric approach or whatever;
                        is that the right term?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That was the term, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, we really jumped for Titgiven the fact that he
                        had broken with the Soviet Union, and we supported him for his lifetime.
                        When you were dealing with Romania, were we calling Ceausescu the new
                        Tito?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I don't recall that we ever used that term, no. Tito openly broke
                    with the Soviet Union and was never a member of the Warsaw Pact. Ceausescu never
                    did leave the Pact, I think, because that would probably have caused the Soviets
                    to invade. He had to limit himself to what he was sure he could get away with.
                    But we followed Romania's relations with Yugoslavia, which were better than they
                    were with other East European countries, and we saw that they were, to some
                    extent cooperating where they could. Tito wasn't a thoroughly totalitarian
                    leader domestically like Ceausescu. Another country in the bloc Ceausescu could
                    collaborate with on the issue of Soviet intervention was Hungary with its
                    so-called “goulash communism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: K�d�r?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: K�d�r, yes. You could see that the Romanians and they were together in
                    opposing, as they could, international trade policies being imposed on all of
                    these countries by Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, Tito was, quite frankly, much more benevolent and
                        smarter. But he had to deal with a rather fractious country which did
                        fracture 10 years or so after his death. To keep it together, he had his
                        constraints.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Did you find that our policy was turning sort of a blind
                        eye to human rights, because one, this country, Romania, was showing its
                        independence from the Soviet Union and two, in one way or another was
                        helping the Jewish problem by getting people out either to Israel or the
                        United States? I would think these issues would have dominated our
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. Well, I don't recall in my career that human rights in East-West
                    relations, became a major issue until President Carter. Human rights, yewe were
                    constantly trying to reunite familiebut we, even though we never recognized the
                    incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia into the Soviet Union and
                    supported their little governments in exile here in Washington, we didn't make
                    human rights a condition to improving direct relations. A good friend of mine,
                    Irv Shiffman, when he was in the Office of East European affairs, had the
                    responsibility for maintaining relations with the Latvian, Lithuanian, and
                    Estonian Embassies, which some teased him about. We did have the annual Captive
                    Nations Congressional Resolutions and Presidential Proclamations, but these were
                    to some extent a reflection of domestic politics to satisfy ethnic groups from
                    the bloc who pressured Washington. Just about everyone in international
                    relations sort of accepted the division into East and West as a permanent fact
                    you had to adjust to like the weather or the Alps. The only things that we could
                    do usefully were to relieve tensions through disarmament negotiations, trade and
                    cultural relations across the divide. Most academics accepted the permanence of
                    the division and pursued careers writing about it.</p>
                <p>In international relations, when you have an impossible situation which can
                    explode into a major war, you do what you can to contain it. That was our
                    containment policy vis-�-vis the Soviet Union from the late '40s onward, of
                    which Kennan was the author. Then you try to change the terms of the equation
                    over time until a point is reached where a solution might become possible.
                    That's why we got into all those disarmament negotiations in Europe, measures to
                    promote coexistence, and all the rest. And that's how I see the Middle East
                    today; I don't think we're anywhere near the point where an agreement acceptable
                    to both sides is possible.</p>
                <p>But anyway, that's how we were operating in East-West relations. Part of trying
                    to change the terms of the equation was polycentrism. We did give most favored
                    nation treatment on trade to Romania. We didn't get all that far with cultural
                    relations. But we did have some secret communication with them in
                    intelligence.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I remember while I was in INR, and we were in this bind in Vietnam, the Romanians
                    were particularly friendly with the Chinese who supported their autonomy. I
                    forgot to mention that. Sino-Soviet differences at their height at that time,
                    and an issue in their relations to with North Vietnam which they both assisted.
                    The Chinese considered Vietnam within their sphere of influence only. At one
                    point, the Chinese passed a message to us through the Romanians, saying that if
                    you want an honorable settlement in Vietnam, deal with us. Don't rely on the
                    Soviets. I remember learning that this report came through, but did not see the
                    actual message. I assume it got short shrift at the White House.</p>
                <p>Personally, I think this was one of Kissinger's big mistakes. He didn't make
                    many, but I think he relied too much on trying to get the Russians to help us in
                    Vietnam with the North Vietnamese. To my mind, the Soviets couldn't have been
                    happier with our problems there; they went all out in supplying them with SAM
                    missiles and training their pilots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, how did the Nixon trip to Romania

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It went extremely well. Off hand, I only have memory of the impression.
                    But I believe he was accompanied by maybe the Secretary of Commerce and one or
                    two others at that level.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Hearst Junior of the newspaper family; I know he was
                        there, and brought some other people with him, reporters. The reason I
                        remember this is his whole party at one point wanted to go to Vietnam to see
                        it. They had visas from Romania in their passports, so the only way they
                        could get into Vietnam if they arrived from the Belgrade airport, was if the
                        American Consul General went out to the airport and sign them in. I was the
                        American Consul General and I cursed that trip, because I had to basically
                        assure the South Vietnamese that Mr. Hearst, of a very conservative
                        newspaper, was all right to go there. Obviously the South Vietnamese didn't
                        want people who traipsed over Communist countries to come into their country
                        unless they were assured by us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But anyway, I was just wondering what we were afraid of. Did we make too much of
                    Romania? I mean, how did we feel about it from your perspective?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, my perspective results from the fact that Romania was my job: I
                    spent most of my working day on it. Other people would probably say we made too
                    much of Romania because of its relative unimportance. But I saw that Romania was
                    not just an irritant the Soviet Union tolerated, but seen as an obstacle to
                    working its will within the bloc. One story I'm sure was well-sourced had to do
                    with an official visit of Khrushchev. Khrushchev was a kind of blunt guy in his
                    dealings, both within the bloc and in Western countries as we well know. Well,
                    Khrushchev was there on a visit said words to this effect to Ceausescu and
                    Romanian leaders, “You know, we have this very cooperative ally, Bulgaria,
                    separated from us by Romania. You are the problem; you should fall in line so we
                    can have harmonious relations.” Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's maximum leader at the
                    time was so close to the Soviets, that he may have even envisioned Bulgaria
                    becoming another Socialist State of the Soviet Union. I once mused that that
                    original maximum druthers of the Soviets was that all the countries of the bloc
                    would eventually ask for admission into the Union.</p>
                <p>Ceausescu's Romanian nationalism did have the sentimental support of the Romania
                    people. Since liberation from the Turks, they prided themselves on their Western
                    culture rooted in Roman Empire. The architecture in the center of Bucharest was
                    modeled on that of France. I recall a French diplomat was quoted as saying: “The
                    Romanians say Bucharest is the Paris of the East; just so they don't try to say
                    that Paris is the Bucharest of the West.” In fact, while Bucharest is large with
                    a population of more than two million in my time, as soon as you got a couple of
                    kilometers from the center, it was an overgrown village. The streets weren't
                    paved, little modern sewage, just an endless expanse of cottage within the city
                    limits.</p>
                <p>I used to say to say as we traveled through Vienna, Budapest, and Bucharest, that
                    Vienna was obviously once the capital of a great empire. You could see that
                    Budapest, the former co-capital, also was a flourishing great city. But
                    Bucharest with a similar population was really an overgrown village. The
                    majority of the population was poor, to some extent even worse off than the
                    Bulgarians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the time how was Madam Ceausescu viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: During my tour and even my two years in INR she wasn't all that
                    prominent. She was becoming prominent when I was in INR but not yet important
                    enough for me to write any intelligence briefs about her. She flaunted an
                    advanced degree in something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'm told the whole thing was very dubious.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: But there was no evidence that she was influencing her husband when I
                    was there. Ceausescu's system was quite simple; he chose good men, good in the
                    sense of efficient and bright and so forth, and demanded that they get things
                    done and that's the way he operated. Her notoriety came somewhat later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well at the time was Ceausescu seen as, you know, I mean,
                        when we move into the '80s, he really, was doing terrible things as far as
                        having too many children born and uncared for and sort of destroying the
                        economy and starving the people. Was that as apparent when you were there,
                        and in dealing with it in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. Ceausescu was ruthless in exploiting anything that could earn hard
                    currency. And that meant squeezing the people, the standard of living. It must
                    have gotten even worse in the 80's when Ceausescu decided to pay off the
                    billions owed to Western countries and banks. But there was no overt opposition;
                    there were no riots because the controls were so severe. You know, there is
                    passage from the New Testament, Christ saying that there's not a bird that flies
                    that isn't cared for by my Father, or something like that. Well, there was
                    nothing that went on in Romania that wasn't followed and controlled by the
                    secret police. Nobody dared to rebel.</p>
                <p>With regard to the decree banning abortion, issued while I was there, to increase
                    the population, the joke then was: Under Communism all the means of production
                    were nationalized and belong to the State, but now Ceausescu has even
                    nationalized the last private means of production, childbearing.</p>
                <p>In the schools, the children were taught to glorify Romania's industrieeven my
                    little daughter who went to a German kindergarten came home singing songs in
                    German like “Romania we love you, your chimneys are smoking;” “smoking” as
                    evidence of industrial production. Pollution wasn't even a minimal concern. It
                    was totalitarianism down to the individual level. As I remarked earlier, more so
                    at that time, than in the Soviet Union itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe your relationship with,
                        particularly, the Romania desk, and the Soviet office of the European
                        Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: My relationship with the Romanian desk was quite good. Kaplan, I can't
                    quite remember his first name, was then the desk officer. Anyway, he was a desk
                    officer who solicited information from me and even asked me to do things. So I
                    had an excellent relationship with the desk. Not with the Soviet office in the
                    Bureau; I had no reason to have any relations with them. All my troubles were
                    with the Soviet analysts in INR. I do believe as a result of my experience in
                    INR that I think any Foreign Service officer who really wants to work in the
                    political/economic sphere would do well do have an early tour in INR. It is so
                    educational. I had the mindset already because of my educational background, but
                    to learn to evaluate intelligence write intelligence reports is absolutely
                    essential.</p>
                <p>One thing which bothered me about intelligence work when I was doing it is how we
                    responded to requests about specific developments on which we had limited
                    information. This concerns CIA's output as well. For example, something takes
                    place in say an African country harmful to our relations, and we're asked
                    whether the Soviets were involved. The least helpful answer was to say that we
                    have no confirming information that they were, and leave it at that. That answer
                    implies that, if the Soviets were behind it, we would know about it. This sort
                    of response was made repeatedly even with respect to the extent of Soviet
                    involvement in the imposition of martial law in Poland. And I will have a lot
                    more to say about that when we get to Polanthose years were really the best
                    professional four years of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the question I'm posing now will have much more
                        pertinence in Poland, but in dealing still with Romania, did the Vatican
                        have annot influencbut any representation in Romania? And also, was the
                        Vatican a source for getting intelligence. And I'm speaking of overt stuff;
                        I mean from nuncios and that sort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: To my recollection, no. I can't recall any kind of relations or
                    exchange of visits or anything between the Vatican and the Romanians. Only after
                    the fall of Communism did that become possible. And then a priest I knew well
                    from my Seminary days was made a Bishop and the first Nuncio to Romania,
                    Bukovsky, originally from Czechoslovakia, specifically Slovakia where
                    Catholicism was strong. He later became the Church's first Nuncio in Moscow.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Catholic Church in Romania was tiny; it had the Orthodox rite, but
                    was loyal to the Vatican. Restrictions on religion under Ceausescu amounted to
                    persecution. Religion was made the handmaiden of the regime; public
                    manifestations were forbidden. Atheism was the official religion and inculcated
                    in the schools. Not even the Orthodox Church to which most Romanians belonged
                    had any kind of autonomy; in fact it was used by Ceausescu's regime,
                    domestically and internationally.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>There was one church in the center of Bucharest with the Western rite my wife and
                    I used to go to. I guess that it was like the one in Moscow, ministering more to
                    the diplomatic community than the Romanians. It was sparsely attended then;
                    quite the contrary to what we found when we visited Romania as tourists in 199so
                    crowded with Romanians that we could hardly get in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well then, you left INR in '71 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I left INR, yes, in 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I went to Genoa. Then another officer who walked on water in the
                    Service, Stromayer, was the number two man at our Consulate General in Genoa,
                    and he had wrangled some good onward assignment. The Bureau's personnel officer,
                    Joan Clark, offered me the opportunity to replace him. I had to resist an
                    immediate transfer, because I had children in school and said no way until
                    school ends in June. Once, someone facetiously remarked that with four
                    assignments to Italy which was a so desirable place to serve, I should be
                    investigated. But the only one I really asked for was the direct transfer to
                    Rome. I like to say I was thrown into breaches.</p>
                <p>And so my next assignment was Genoa in 1971. Because of my Italian and previous
                    experience in Italy I didn't need any special training. It was a good position,
                    and I thoroughly enjoyed my tour there. I was deputy to the Consul General, and
                    the economic/commercial/ political officer; just about every function outside of
                    administrative and consular work; when substituting for the Consul General in
                    his absence, I got into this as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: From '71 to '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: When I arrived the Consul General was Gori Bruno, who was about to
                    retire. He was succeeded then by Tom Murfin, who had served in Japan. I found
                    them both great people to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation? What did the Genoa
                        Consular District consist of, and what were our interests? I don't imagine
                        shipping was big in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No. It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Genoa was and is a major port of Italy, especially for the shipment of
                    containers. As for the general political situation, the center-left was
                    depressed and worried; the Communists were coming on. Nationally, there was talk
                    of the Compromesso Storico, the historic compromise, which would bring the
                    Communists into the government. As far as consular work goes it, was not overly
                    burdensome in Genoa. We did issue immigration visas. The head of the Consular
                    Section for most of that time was Bob Ode, who was later a captive in Tehran
                    when the Iranians took over our Embassy. At that time he was already retired,
                    but working as a WAE, temporarily employed to help out there. We became close
                    friends with him and his wife, Rita.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O-D-E?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: O-D-E, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, let me just stop here. Today is the 4th of
                        April, 2008. Carl, how'd you get to Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: My transfer is a story in itself. During my last year in Genoa I asked
                    for a direct transfer to the political section in Rome. As an Italy specialist,
                    Rome was like a Mecca for me. When I raised this possibilitI'm not sure if the
                    reply came from the Embassy or the Department, I think the Embassthey told me in
                    effect, “Who do you think you are? Don't you know that Rome is an R&amp;R, Rest
                    and Recreation, post for people coming out of Africa and other hardship posts?
                    So I dropped any thought of a direct transfer.</p>
                <p>I was eventually told that I would soon be paneled, officially assigned, as
                    Counselor of Political Affairs in Jamaica; and I was quite happy with that. It
                    came down to about a week before departure in early July, wheout of the bluI got
                    a call from a personnel officer in the Department: “Carl, how about Rome?” is
                    how he opened the conversation. An officer, who had gone through Italian
                    language and area training for the political position in Rome to follow the
                    Socialist, Republican, and Social Democratic parties, seized an opportunity to
                    switch to the economic specialty; so they were suddenly left high and dry for
                    somebody for Rome who wouldn't need training. And so that's how I got a direct
                    transfer to Rome. Again, I was thrown into a breach, so to speak, but I liked
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You were in Rome from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I was in Rome from mid '74 to mid '76, two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador and DCM, and how did you find the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Ambassador at that time was John Volpe, who had made a fortune in
                    construction in Boston, been governor of Massachusetts twice, and Secretary of
                    Transportation under Nixon. He was a prominent Republican in a State where
                    Democrats normally dominated. The DCM was Bob Beaudry; he had been an office
                    director in EUR before going to Italy. Bob Beaudry was one of the best
                    supervisors I ever had in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>The Embassy itself I found to be compartmentalized, like the Department. It had
                    so many sections, including other agency offices like, Treasury, the FBI, INthe
                    Immigration and Naturalization Serviceven the Coast Guard; you name one. And my
                    experience was that they hardly talked to each other, you know, just as in the
                    Department. They dealt primarily with their Italian counterparts and their
                    agencies. Turf protection was a paramount priority, especially on the part of
                    the Economic Section. I was in the Political section of about six officers
                    headed by a Political Counselor. Four of us had different parties to follow and
                    maintain contacts in them. It was pretty hard to avoid mention of some economic
                    development in a political reporting cable, and you soon heard about it, if you
                    had failed to clear it in advance with the Economic Counselor. So I found the
                    work environment in the Embassy kind of stuffy and formal, more like in the
                    Department than in any other post in which I served. In fact, in some ways I
                    thought the Department wasn't quite as bad.</p>
                <p>But my family and I really enjoyed living in Rome. I mentioned before that in the
                    Foreign Service, you have the best of both worlds abroad. And in Italy you
                    really have a great other world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the Socialist, Republican...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: ...I dealt with the Socialist Party, PSI; the Republicans, PRI; and the
                    Social Democrats, the PSDI who had broken off long ago from the PSI over the
                    latter's alliance with the Communists. I personally didn't consider the PSDI
                    really relevant after the Socialists broke with the Communists, the PCI, but it
                    is amazing how they continued to survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we get to that, what was your impression
                        during the time you were there of Ambassador Volpe and how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Volpe was very dependent on his DCM, Beaudry, in political matters, and
                    I believe he followed his advice quite closely. He had good relations with the
                    many Ministers of the Italian coalition Governments. By rank, only the
                    Ambassador, or in his absence, the DCM met with government Ministers; Ministries
                    correspond to Departments in our government. We in the Political Section dealt
                    directly with lower ranking officials on the government side, but even with
                    Party Secretaries on the political side. Having served both in embassies and
                    consulates, I came to realize that embassies primarily deal with governments and
                    bureaucrats, while consulates deal primarily with the local people and power
                    elites. So, from the point of view of promoting understanding between our
                    peoples and influencing local power eliteeconomic and culturaI think consulates
                    are far more important than the embassies.</p>
                <p>This is a bit of a digression, but trying to centralize all our work in the
                    Embassy in a large country is just nonsense. You can't carry out the Foreign
                    Service mandate legislated by Congress without consulates in the major
                    metropolitan centers of a democracy; and now they're trying to do it with one
                    person and a computer for budgetary and security reasonas Third World countries
                    din many cities of Europe where we've closed consulates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the people within the Ministry of
                        Foreign Affairs who dealt with the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They couldn't have been nicer. The powers that be, the powers that were
                    in running Italy at the time I was there maintained this tradition of extremely
                    friendly relations with the United States and its representatives. These people
                    still remembered their debt to us through the Marshall Plan and other support
                    the U.S. had provided when the Italian lira was under pressure. Also, our
                    military bases provided much employment to local populations.</p>
                <p>But the Italian electorate was pretty much split between pro-Western people,
                    still a clear majority, and leftists who saw NATO and the United States as
                    adversaries. And on the labor union level the idea that the Soviet Union was
                    still a paradise and what have you was very strong. At the same time
                    Euro-Communism was on the rise a re-thinking by many Communist leaders in Italy
                    and other West European countries, that democracy was not so bad, and that NATO
                    could be tolerated as a necessity in the Cold War, until agreement could be
                    reached to dissolve both the blocs. The French Communists were probably still
                    closer to the Soviet Union than the Italian Communists, but the Italian
                    Communists had that hard core within their labor unions for whom
                    Marxism-Leninism was a religion, and the Soviet Union its Mecca. They still
                    revered the Soviet Union as having defeated Hitler and, through its agents in
                    the Communist guerillas in the latter years of the war, of even helping liberate
                    Italy from Fascism. The role of the U.K. and U.S. was ignored or downplayed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was CGTOL?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: CGIL. I don't recall exactly the Italian words of the acronym, but an
                    Association or Congress of Communist Labor Unions. They were the strongest of
                    the unions. Each of the other major parties had their own affiliated unions; the
                    CISL was the association of Christian Democratic unions. There were also unions
                    affiliated with the Socialist Party, but I think dominated by the Communisteven
                    unions affiliated with the Social Democrats, the PSDI. As I said before, I
                    considered them no longer relevant, because they had split from the Socialists
                    over the latter's ties with the Communists, but the Socialists had since split
                    with the Communists in the early '60s. Logically, one would have expected them
                    to reunite with the Socialists, but that is not how politics in Italy was
                    played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about the Socialists about
                        this period of time. In the first place, what was the common reckoning of
                        why the Socialists in Italy were not the power that they were in the rest of
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Simply because the Communists dominated the Left from the outset; that
                    was pretty much it. The Socialists split off in the early '60s when the first
                    Center-Left government was formed. Amintore Fanfani of the Christian Democrats
                    was the Prime Minister when it happened.</p>
                <p>It was a dramatic move, but the Socialists didn't take that much of the left with
                    them. There were even splintered leftist groups, extremist groups to the left of
                    the Communists. And all of this arises from the last months of the war and the
                    immediate post-war period when the Communist guerillas not only attacked Italian
                    Fascists and the Germans, but even non-Communist guerilla fighters. I am
                    convinced that the true history of what went on in Italy during the war after it
                    was obvious that Italy and Germany would be defeated has still to be told to
                    most Italians. I'm not sure even Western historians are aware of all that went
                    on. Anti-fascism and eradicating it became the religion of the day. Any moderate
                    who had associated with it in any way was tarred with its brush. Those who
                    envisaged a restoration of the Monarchy had no say at all. I don't know whether
                    it would have been good or not for the Italians to retain a monarchy like
                    England's, but in the referendum the Monarchy was rejected. I don't think that
                    was any real loss.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: On the other hanI may have mentioned this earliewhen I was in Naples
                    from '62 to '65 I sensed a certain nostalgia for Mussolini. You know that famous
                    quote about him that he made the trains run on time. I think Mussolini's big
                    mistake was allying himself with Hitler. If he'd done what Franco did he would
                    be in the Valhalla of Italian leaders. But, of course, that would have been
                    psychologically impossible for him to do. He thought he was a modern Caesar.
                    Success in Ethiopia and Hitler's early imitation of him had gone to his
                    head.</p>
                <p>Getting back to Rome, to the political situation in Italy while I was there,
                    these were years of deep pessimism for us and our interests. Enrico Berlinguer,
                    First Secretary of the Communist party, was a euro-communist who explicitly
                    accepted NATO, and he was a popular personality as well. His aim was to bring
                    about the historic compromise, the compromesso storico by which the Communists
                    would be admitted into a coalition government and share power. For most
                    observers, it was not a question of whether, but when. U.S. policy was still
                    very much against seeing the Communists admitted into the Italian government, to
                    which we were so closely allied.</p>
                <p>I remember once, just before a political staff meeting with the Ambassador, we
                    got word that Andreotti who was given the mandate to form a government had
                    secretly met with Berlinguer on the subject. The Ambassador was upset that
                    Andreotti was apparently betraying us. When no one else said anything in defense
                    of Andreotti for whom I had an admiration, I spoke up in his defense saying it
                    doesn't necessarily mean that he is working to have this happen. In fact, actual
                    inclusion of the Communists in a coalition government never came about.</p>
                <p>In a way, we have the Red Brigades to thank for that. After they kidnapped Aldo
                    Moro, the First Secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, who was actively
                    promoting the historic compromise, a deal was struck whereby the Communists
                    refrained from voting against a government made up of DC ministers only in
                    return for collaboration in the Parliament on some major bills, and for some
                    influential positions in the organization of the Parliament. The other parties
                    went along with this sort of non-Government of solidarity.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I had always admired Andreotti whom I only met once at a reception. First, he was
                    not corrupt in the sense of using public or party funds to enrich himself. And
                    he had always shown himself a loyal ally of the United States. He was very much
                    a clever manipulator in managing Christian Democratic relations with the other
                    parties. I defended him on that basiwho could be sure what he was up to? Even we
                    for some time already had recognized the need to have some kind of relationship
                    with the Communist Party, the PCI, given recent gains at the ballot box when it
                    threatened to outpoll the DC, and, because of the social democratic and
                    euro-communist tendencies of some of its leaders. So about the time of my
                    arrival, we assigned a Foreign Service officer in the section, Marty Wenick, to
                    meet with leaders of the PCI as we others did with leaders of the parties for
                    which we were responsible. The so-called other agency had been doing this for
                    some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would hope so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Exactly. But this didn't increase the optimism of our loyal friends in
                    the other parties so as to what the U.S. was up to. They, of course were aware
                    that we were doing thithere were really no secrets in Italian politics. We
                    seemed to be pursuing contradictory policies in our relations with the
                    parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were there, was there any reference at all
                        to what had happened in Portugal? Because the Portuguese revolution was in
                        '74, and at that point the young officers looked like they were heading
                        right down the path into the Communist arms, and we were thinking of getting
                        Portugal out of NATO, when actually the work of Frank Carlucci and others
                        there at our Embassy, was quite magnificent. Was that at all on your
                        radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't have any explicit recall, but I'm sure it was in the context of
                    Euro Communism. There was considerable optimism on the part of many analysts and
                    observers that Communism in Western Europe was becoming democratic. And so that
                    kind of mitigated the pessimism of some. Skeptics wondered, however, what they
                    would do once they achieved power through the democratic system. In this regard
                    the Italian Communists were popular within academia in the U.S. I can't recall
                    the name of this professor at Harvard or Yale who each year attended the PCI's
                    National Congress as a special guest.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>He was telling us that they were the true democrats, the uncorrupt politicians in
                    Italy, and urging the State Department to embrace them. Personally I saw a
                    contradiction within the PCI itself, between an ably led still emotionally loyal
                    to the Soviet Union base, and other leaders who wanted their party to become a
                    full member of the of the ruling government coalitions. Italy was a democracy,
                    but not as direct a democracy as ours. There you voted primarily for parties,
                    rather than individual candidates to whom you could only give rank order
                    preference within the party. So the real power resided in the parties. Some
                    called it partitocrazia, a “partyocracy” to coin a term, the group of
                    center-right to center-left parties from which governing coalitions were formed,
                    but continuously dominated by the Christian Democrats since the war. This system
                    was so important to each of the parties that they cooperated with each other to
                    maintain it, despite their differences over policies. Or, as I liked to put it:
                    as a group they were not about to let power to slip on one side to the people or
                    to the government or the other; the party First Secretaries remained the most
                    powerful leaders within the system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the party secretaries in the Socialist and the

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: On the Socialist side Bettino Craxi had emerged. He was the Benjamin of
                    Pietro Nenni, the patriarch Socialist, who finally broke off with the Communists
                    back in the early '60s. He was then in retirement. I once acted as escort and
                    interpreter for Hubert Humphrey who visited him in his apartment. I'll never
                    forgot Humphrey's comment as he looked out the window of our car, stuck in
                    traffic in the affluent commercial area near the Embassy. “This is the most
                    affluent damn country I have ever seen in economic difficulty.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Nenni...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Pietro Nenni, yes. But Craxi was always seen as his favored son to
                    replace him. At the time I was there Craxi was a Deputy Secretary of the party,
                    and De MartinI keep forgetting first nameFirst Secretary. And I met several
                    times one-on-one over lunch with Craxi.</p>
                <p>My way of handling my work was first to read four or five newspapers, starting
                    with Corriere della Sera, which had a journalist who was absolutely outstanding.
                    I wish I could remember his name. His column was usually on the front page. When
                    something was going on, he would talk to leaders of the parties involved,
                    summarize their views, and come up with his own analysis. He had access to them
                    because he represented Italy's most prestigious newspaper. Then I would look at
                    the party organs, the PCI's 'Unit�, the PSI's Avanti, and so on. And then I
                    would pick out somebody from my three partiemore often a socialist, because they
                    held the balance of power. They had a relative small percentage of the vote, but
                    it was enough for them to swing the balance from center-right to center-left.
                    Using my “representational allowance,” as it was called, to host Italian
                    politicians in fine restaurants so you can learn something from them to report
                    was about the most pleasurable aspect of my work.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>There's a restaurant in Rome, it still exists I'm sure, run by nuns, missionary
                    French nuns, called Joie de Vivre. It's down in the heart of old Rome, near the
                    Senate, and was a meeting place for politicians. In fact, the Christian
                    Democrats used to hold leadership sessions in a private room on the second
                    floor. The menu was fantastic. And so more often than not that's where I took my
                    guest. I'd always ask him to choose the wine, because there's no Italian who
                    doesn't consider himself an expert on wine. I was an amateur in this area, and
                    it kind of flattered the guest.</p>
                <p>I came to like Craxi, even though I had no admiration for the Socialists as a
                    party. It became obvious to me that Craxi was very anti-communist, because the
                    Communists were the major threat to his party's autonomy. The Communists had so
                    many members of the Socialist party, including representatives in parliament, in
                    their hip pocket, so-to-speak. They supported these fellow-travelers; even
                    helped them get elected as Socialists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're making a gesture, showing a payoff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. And I remember my counterpart on the other agency side several
                    times approaching me and suggesting I establish contact with this Socialist
                    representative from Umbria; but from other sources I had within the Socialist
                    Party I knew that this guy was in the pocket of the Communist Party, so I
                    refused ever to meet with him. The Christian Democrats were notorious for having
                    corrupt politicians, those who used party funds for personal ends. But the
                    Socialists seemed to have an even bigger reputation for personal corruption.
                    Craxi was anti-communist and I favored him. I recall writing a cable in which I
                    promoted him as a man we should support. That pretty much was the situation when
                    I left in 1976.</p>
                <p>From a career point of view, I made the big mistake of refusing the offer of a
                    third year in Rommy assignment was for only twwhich Bob Beaudry had gotten for
                    me without a by-your-leave from me. I turned it down because at that time my
                    children had already been out of the United for five years. I've always been a
                    kind of chauvinistic American in the sense that I wanted my children to be
                    culturally American, feel like Americans, and not just be American citizens
                    unfamiliar with their own country. I'd seen children of colleagues who had spent
                    so much time abroad that they were more at home in Europe than in the U.S. And
                    so, with the motivation of getting my children back into an American
                    environment, I turned down the opportunity to stay on in Rome. I opted for an
                    out-of-cone assignment in OES, the Bureau of Oceans and International
                    Environmental and Scientific Affairs, because of my love of science and
                    technology. Career wise, that was an even bigger mistake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Rome, one of the things that always struck
                        magain, I'm not a political officer and I followed you there by about a yeaI
                        came in '79 down in Naples as Consul General. I had never served in Italy,
                        never served as a political officer; I'm a consular officer. And I kept
                        getting these things from Rome on political developments asking how does
                        this or that play here in Naples. Well, the point was it didn't play at all.
                        And I came away with a very distinct impression that our Embassy, obviously
                        the political section, was part of a minuet that didn't amount to a damn
                        thing as far as Italian politics were concerned. I think things have changed
                        now but in those days it was all the Christian Democrats. Ministers may have
                        changed, but they were all part of the same thing; and when the chips were
                        down the Italians were with us; all this political maneuvering, particularly
                        the reporting on it, which included Carl Bastiani's reporting, what the hell
                        difference did it make? I'd like you to comment on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. Yes, we very closely monitored developments within each of these
                    parties. In a less open way, we also tried to influence. That was our job.
                    Remember, I said we were worried about the Compromesso Storico, about the
                    Communists coming into government. It wasn't a completely stable system. In the
                    Italian system a gain of one and a half percent for one party in an election was
                    a lot. Had the PCI's percentage of the vote ever exceeded that of the Dthey were
                    both around the mid-30s at the timthey would have become the party of relative
                    majority, and, under the system, been given the first opportunity to form a
                    government by the President of Italy. That was one of his few responsibilities.
                    Fortunately, none of this happened. After cresting just below the DC's total in,
                    I think, 1976, the PCI's share receded until about 1980 when they gave up making
                    deals in Parliament and returned to active opposition. Many of their faithful
                    followers had been unhappy with the compromises they had made.</p>
                <p>With regard to reporting, despite all the resources we devoted to it, I had a
                    very interesting experience, which illustrates how hard it is to know what was
                    going on. The government of the day was Center-Left, a coalition which included
                    the center parties and the Socialists with the balance of power. Then one day in
                    this particular period the Socialists threatened to withdraw from the coalition,
                    and bring down the government. To learn what the socialists were really up to,
                    the Ambassador invited the First secretary, De Martino, to lunch at the
                    residence. And I, of course, did the briefing paper in advance. We always had to
                    do a briefing paper for the ambassador for such meetings. I was invited to the
                    dinner as the note taker and to do some interpreting. De Martino said the
                    Socialists created the threat of crisis to negotiate for more power within the
                    coalition, another Ministry or two, I guess, but had no intention of bringing
                    down the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I don't recall the specifics but he assured the ambassador that they would not
                    bring down the government. So I rushed back to the embassy, and drafted a cable
                    reporting what De Martino had said, got it approved, ran it to the
                    communications section, and handed it in for transmission. I no sooner got back
                    to my office than I learned that the government had just fallen; the Socialists
                    had just withdrawn. So I zipped back down the corridor to the communications
                    section to retrieve the draft if I could. Fortunately, they had not yet finished
                    coding it for transmission. I and the Political Counselor hastily edited it to
                    say what had actually happened, despite the First Secretary's assurances. I'm
                    sure De Martino didn't deliberately mislead us; not even he knew what his party
                    was up to in Parliament while we were together. That just shows you how
                    uncertain politics were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, beyond the Compromesso Storico, was there any
                        particular issuthis is before the SS-20 missile crisis and all that which
                        came latewere any particular issues that we were concerned about with
                        Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, one was the stability of the Italian lira, a convertible
                    currency. Chronically, it became very weak because Italian governments were
                    perennially in deficit because of social spending, particularly on health care,
                    which from the beginning was a single government payer system. At this time, all
                    the Western European countries fended financially on their own. The U.S. bailed
                    them out more than once.</p>
                <p>I remember vividly the crisis which occurred during my first Italian tour in
                    Naples. The people were in a panic that their lira savings would become
                    worthless. That included my numerous relatives. One of them, a first cousin,
                    made a special trip to Naples with a bag full of lira notes of large
                    denomination to ask me to convert them to dollars. It was the first and only
                    time they asked a favor of me. Well, of course I couldn't; there was no way I
                    could do it properly, even if I had the money. For most of my career, I
                    practiced my own brand of deficit spending, rolling over loans with the State
                    Department Federal Credit Union, to which I remain eternally grateful.
                    Fortunately, news reports had just appeared that the United States was extending
                    a two billion dollar line of credit to Italy. That stabilized the lira, and I
                    was able to assure my relatives that their money would not become worthless.</p>
                <p>Of course, everybody knew about the black economy which didn't pay taxes and
                    which didn't get into the statistics. I think I first came to realize this
                    during my tour in Genoa. You never really knew how badly the economy was
                    globally. I came to realize that, in spite of all this talk about how bad things
                    were, more people were living better every day. Not to deny that some people
                    obviously were suffering more, but statistically more people were living better
                    every day. And I considered that part of the continuing Italian economic
                    miracle. The first one, of course, occurred shortly after the war.</p>

                        Brigades, you know, these homegrown terrorist groups. What was happening
                        while you were there? How did we react about them and how did we see their

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Red Brigades, I guess, were the most well-known and the most
                    successful in carrying out their operations. While I was in Rome I didn't feel
                    personally threatened, because they were not targeting diplomats and practicing
                    indiscriminate terrorism like planting bombs in restaurants. They were targeting
                    businessmen and politicians. They were shooting them in the knees, kneecapping.
                    We can revisit this years later when I go back to Italy to reopen the Consulate
                    in Torino. Then terrorism against Americans was very much in vogue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I think this was pretty common in the South, the Mezzogiorno, and of
                    course these deputies were in Parliament. But, in the mid '70s, I don't know
                    that it was all that common in the North, as it later became. But to my
                    knowledge and recollection, this was not a major public issue at the time. I'm
                    talking '74 to '76. And I don't think at that time that the Mafia in its various
                    forms had penetrated Northern Italy to the extent that it had by the time I got
                    back there in the '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. You're a good Catholic; how about the

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. The Church. We had at that time a Vatican office. I guess it was
                    not until the Reagan Administration that we raised our relations with the
                    Vatican to formal Embassy status. The Vatican office was almost like another
                    office of the Embassy, even though it had its own site. However, even after it
                    became an Embassy, it relied entirely on the Embassy for communications and
                    administrative resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Embassy to the Holy See?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. You had one American Foreign Service Officer there permanently
                    handling day-to-day business. The Special Representative and later Ambassador
                    appointed by the President weren't even there much of the time. It was a job I
                    coveted, to tell you the truth, because I was so familiar with the Church. But
                    from my earliest days as an analyst in foreign affairs, let's say from the
                    beginning of my career as a Foreign Service officer, I never thought very highly
                    of Vatican diplomacy. I didn't think they were very good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They hung on to old positions far too long. The major one in my mind
                    was Israel. They wouldn't recognize Israel and have relations with it far beyond
                    the point of diminishing returns, and advocated making Jerusalem a free city.
                    Realistically, this was never in the cards. Not recognizing Israel only
                    supported the impression - which wasn't true - that the Vatican was
                    anti-Semitic. I thought their policy toward Latin American countries, was until
                    John Paul II changed it, much too stuck on tradition and so identified with the
                    wealthy. Toward East Europe, they had their own Ost-Politik which I thought gave
                    too much priority to establishing or maintaining relations with Communist
                    regimes even in countries like Czechoslovakia after 1968, while the regime it
                    was actively persecuting the underground Church.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know there are certain elements in Liberation Theology

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed it did. But the Church was quite right in opposing the use of
                    violence to help the poor. It's kind of funny, both in Latin America and even
                    more so, I think in Africa, that the leaders, the people who emerged as maximum
                    leaders had been educated in Catholic schools. They weren't loyal to Catholic
                    teaching when they got into politics. Church missionary activity always
                    emphasizes education, and so, I surmise, these people were the best equipped to
                    become political leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the Socialist, Social Democratic field, did the

                        of a role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Socialists and Social Democrats?</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't recall any explicit anti-Vatican pronouncements by the
                    Socialists after their split off from the Communists; but they certainly weren't
                    friendly with the Church. They did think their main adversary, the Christian
                    Democrats, were allies of the Church. Overall, the Church had great political
                    influence, and I doubt that the Socialists would have considered it politically
                    wise to make it an issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>The Church was mainly concerned with general morality and crusaded on issues like
                    divorce and abortion. The thing about the Church in Italy was that you had
                    individual Cardinals in the conservative-liberal spectrum. The Cardinal of Genoa
                    at the time I was there was an extreme conservative. The Cardinal of Milan was
                    quite liberal. And then you had the liberal Pope John the XXIII who actually
                    called the Vatican council. But no, the only party that had really good
                    relations with the Vatican was the Christian Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left Italy in '78 to go back to Washington.
                        By the way, how did your wife and kids find living in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I left in '76, not '78; I was there from '74 to '76. My wife and
                    children enjoyed Rome as much as I did. When we were in Rome only a few of the
                    top officers received government-furnished quarters. They were not in a USG
                    ghetto, but individual homes in the city. The rest of us received housing
                    allowances which were always below current rentals due to inflation, so I was a
                    bit out of pocket, which led me, with three kids, to finding affordable housing
                    in half of a brand new duplex villa with a walled acre of yard north of Rome, in
                    La Storta, on a dead end side road off the highway which went past the Vatican's
                    international radio antenna farm. The children went to Marymount International
                    School, about half the distance down the Via Cassia toward the Embassy in the
                    center. We received a full educational allowance for that. I am eternally
                    grateful to the Department for the educational allowances we received while
                    abroad. I had found that overseas I always had enough money to pay down on my
                    loans with the Credit Union. In Washington I always had to add to make new
                    loans.</p>
                <p>An advantage to having your children with you abroad is that they're much more
                    dependent on you, and much less exposed to the distractions of television and
                    peer influence, as they are here in the States. For children what's normal is
                    what they've experienced as small children. I remember daughter number two
                    asking after two or three years in Washington, when are we going overseas again.
                    And it's not because she was unhappy with her situation in Rockville where she
                    had good friends and was doing well in school. Every one of my five daughters
                    speaks Italian to some degree, and they were all open to friendships with peers
                    of other ethnic origin. My youngest daughter, in fact, seemed to attract these
                    people Rockville High School. Most of her friends were of Latino, Asian or Black
                    origin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My kids did the same thing. I mean, their group ends up
                        being Foreign Service or foreigners because this is their milieu. Well,
                        let's go off to the office of Oceans, Environment and Science, OES, in the
                        State Department. You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I was there two years from mid'76 to mid '78, two years. And I had
                    asked for this assignment because of my infatuation with science and technology.
                    I was placed in OES's Technology transfer and Space Office. I was the only FSO
                    in it; it was a small office, two of whose people trained as scientists and had
                    transferred from the Department of Defense, to the State Department. I soon came
                    to see that when a scientist transfers to managing our relations on scientific
                    issues with other countries, he is no longer a scientist, but becomes a
                    bureaucrat, like every other bureaucrat. The office reported through a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, Ozzie Ganley, to the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>We had these responsibilities, but we had no budgetary resources to implement
                    them. I think this was true of most of the other offices in OES, but they didn't
                    need targeted budgetary resources as I thought we did to carry out our mission.
                    OES was, and may still be, just a collection of disparate offices that deal more
                    with offices outside of OES than with each other. We were not a cohesive
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>The big project in my office was implementing Kissinger's promise, among others,
                    in a UN speech that the U.S. would help create a databank of technology within
                    the UN to which Third World countries would have free access. The people on the
                    American side - now I'm talking about transfer of technology theorists in
                    academia and industry - advocated so-called “appropriate technology,” which
                    created employment for unskilled people in primitive economies...more of the
                    nature of crafts. “Small is beautiful” was one of their sayings. Well, somewhat
                    like Ceausescu for Romania, the political leaders in these countries with
                    primitive economies, wanted modern turn-key technology; and they wanted it for
                    nothing. I worked almost exclusively on trying to carry out Kissinger's promise
                    of a technology data base in the UN. I went periodically to the UN for meetings
                    with the corresponding UN people, and it was mostly talk. It was just talk.
                    Neither we nor they disposed of resources to do anything ourselves. I'm talking
                    now about OES, our Technology Policy Office. So I was moved to respond to a
                    general call for foreign policy ideas from the Policy Planning Office on the 7th
                    floor. I spent a lot of time writing a paper proposing U.S. technology
                    initiatives toward third world countries. Did I get the name of the office
                    right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's the Policy Planning Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: So I wrote this paper - I still have a copy of it - entitled
                    “Prolegomena for an Effective US Policy on Technology Transfer to LDCs.” That
                    title harkens back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant, one of the greatest
                    epistemologists ever, and my academic background in Philosophy.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>We were still in the colder part of the Cold War then, and I proposed a project
                    in it as means to influence third world countries, like India, to go with us
                    rather than the Soviets. Essentially I proposed a fully funded U.S. initiative
                    to beam educational instruction from satellites to third World countries in the
                    languages of the countries. Under it, we would give these countries millions of
                    simple radios to receive the transmissions at no cost to them. And I proposed it
                    as a Federal Government initiative administered by AID rather than OES, since
                    OES had no resources anyway for such programs. I submitted my paper directly to
                    the Policy Planning Office, rather than up the chain of command, with a copy to
                    the deputy secretary, Ozzie Ganley.</p>
                <p>Well, the next thing I know I'm called into Ozzie Ganley's office to explain
                    myself. Why hadn't I submitted it just to him? I said I was afraid it might not
                    get any farther, because I proposed that the leading role be given to AID and
                    not OES. And, if memory serves me well, he said it wouldn't have gone any
                    farther.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that the call for papers were designed to do
                        just this. In other words this is still roughly the bureaucracy - let's hear
                        from the troops what they think...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, that was my feeling in the beginning. I didn't even give it a
                    thought that anybody would object. As I wrote it, I began to worry that it
                    wouldn't go any further because I wasn't proposing money for OES to administer
                    it. I didn't see that as realistic at all at the time.</p>
                <p>My tour in OES proved to be the worst assignment I ever had in the Foreign
                    Service - and I had asked for it. It was a dead end assignment. For most of the
                    time I was there, Patsy Mink was the Assistant Secretary. I don't recall the
                    name of her predecessor who was there when I arrived; but he was quite qualified
                    and professional. Patsy Mink had no background whatsoever in this area. A former
                    member of the House, she had run for the Senate and lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Hawaii or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: From Hawaii. And after the months and months it took the Carter
                    Administration to get up and running in certain areas, she was finally
                    appointed. I saw the appointment as her safety net for political and personal
                    income reasons. She was pleasant enough toward me, until the day she sent word
                    that she wanted to see me after the business work hours at 5:30. So I went to
                    her office and took a seat in the waiting room. I waited and waited to be called
                    in. At the time, I was a member of a five-person car pool, then the only
                    practical way to get to Rockville, other than driving one's own car. We had a
                    rule that if you didn't show up in the garage by ten of six, you would have to
                    find your own way home. And there was no Metro at this time or bus service to
                    near my home. Shortly before the witching hour, I explained all this to the
                    receptionist and raced to the garage. Well - this I learned immediately the next
                    morning - had infuriated Patsy Mink, so she had given the assignment she had for
                    me to another in the office.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>I apologize for talking more now of my personal problems in OES than the foreign
                    policy work I did, but it was a traumatic period in my career.</p>
                <p>During this tour OES was inspected by the Inspector General's Office. Now, I had
                    gone through several inspections in my career, and every one of them, for me,
                    had been very positive. Well, in this particular inspection, I was interviewed
                    by an inspector who soon made it very obvious that his mission was to find jobs
                    that should be eliminated. I don't know what he had been told in advance about
                    me and my work, but it couldn't have been positive. Apparently the Department
                    was on one of its periodic kicks to eliminate positions. These usually occur at
                    a change of administration, and are call RIFs, Reductions in Force. And so he
                    very aggressively questioned me on what I did and why. Of course I put my work
                    in the best light. I mean, I wasn't going to say this technology transfer
                    initiative Kissinger had committed us to made no sense. I had sole
                    responsibility in the office for it. It was a foreign policy commitment.</p>
                <p>He must have written a lousy report on me. As I said, it was the worst assignment
                    in my career. And I couldn't wait to get out of it. So as soon as I could I
                    volunteered for Polish language training and transfer to Poland as Principal
                    Officer at Krakow. I am eternally grateful to the personnel officer who gave me
                    this assignment. But before we get to that, a new Assistant Secretary took over
                    OES just before I left; I'm trying to recall his name...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Pickering. I just saw him yesterday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Is that right! Well, in came Tom Pickering and I remember well our
                    meeting when he made the rounds to meet each of us personally at his work place.
                    I knew of him already, and admired him. After our little session, I thought that
                    if he had only been the Assistant Secretary during my tour in OES, things might
                    have been very different. But it was just my bad luck to have come into OES at
                    the worst possible time.</p>
                <p>But anyway, what happened was that this personnel officer whose name I can't
                    remember - I believe it was Tom Kruse- not only got me assigned to Krakow, but
                    when at the last minute he was under pressure to break it, maintained it for me.
                    Apparently, a woman officer had asked for the assignment, no doubt one who was
                    well qualified and ambitious. I found that out later. And that assignment turned
                    out to be the best four years of my entire professional career. I had about
                    twelve years in Italy, but in total they didn't weigh as heavily on the scale
                    professionally as the four years in Krakow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're talking about '78. You were taking Polish, is
                        that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seventy-eight to '79. How did you find Polish
                        language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Difficult. Remember, I was in my 50s and, while I had studied lots of
                    languages - and the more you study languages the easier it gets to acquire
                    another - I found Polish difficult. Polish is a Slav tongue, but it has lots of
                    Latin words in it. I've heard it said that the Poles are the Italians of the
                    North. They do have this Italian Western Catholic culture that I think is very
                    civilizing, because it abhors violence. You can sense it when you are in
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>Polish is totally inconsistent. Because it is so inconsistent, the only way to
                    learn to speak it is the oral-aural method, based on the principle that you
                    should learn it as much as possible as you learned your mother tongue as a
                    child, by imitation. Studying a grammar and putting words together may teach you
                    to read, but it doesn't teach you to speak. That I call the code cracking
                    approach. Learning to speak a language is not primarily an intellectual
                    exercise. The object is to short circuit the brain: to associate patterns of
                    sound directly with ideas. You ignore grammar; that's embedded in the patterns
                    of sound and comes naturally, as it does to a child learning her mother
                    tongue.</p>
                <p>I had a good tutor, but she was not nearly as demanding as the one I had for
                    Romanian many years ago. And I was in with two other officers, one going out as
                    the military attach� and the other as the admin officer, neither of whom had had
                    much experience with foreign languages. And so the pace was slow and relaxed,
                    and we spent too much time talking about other things in English. One day
                    somebody knocked on the door and said, “They've just elected a Polish pope. Our
                    first thought was that this is just another of those Polish jokes. But sure
                    enough, Cardinal Wojtyla had just been elected. Of course we didn't speak Polish
                    for the rest of that class. Anyway, I did test out at the 3,3 level, which meant
                    I could converse well enough to get along without an interpreter before I
                    arrived at post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went right to Krakow. You were there from '79
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Eighty-three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you put the state of relations between the
                        United States and Poland at the time you went out in '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: At that time our relations with this Communist country, a Warsaw Pact
                    country loyal to the Soviet Union, were probably better than with any of the
                    other East European countries. The Polish Workers Party, that is, the Communist
                    party, which, as is standard in all those countries had the monopoly of power -
                    this so-called leading role was written right into the constitution - was sort
                    of liberal in its application. Hungary, among Warsaw Pact countries by that time
                    was also. There, some analysts called it “goulash communism,” and even alleged
                    that the Hungarians preferred it to a Western democratic system. I considered
                    that an insult to the Hungarian people.</p>
                <p>But, to answer your question, our relations with Poland were good, given these
                    limitations, they being a member of the Soviet bloc. More Poles were getting
                    exit visas to come to the United States than in almost any of the other
                    countries. I don't have any numbers but I think even more so than from Hungary
                    itself. And cultural relations were rather good. We were also providing economic
                    assistance, loans, and substantial agricultural assistance through the PL-480
                    program.</p>
                <p>Gierek had long been in power and had an attractive personality. I think he had
                    worked in Belgium early in his life, and knew Western ways. He succeeded in
                    getting all kinds of loans from the West, from Germany especially, and
                    squandered them to maintain the standard of living in a failing economy. There
                    was also a lot of corruption; I assume some of the money found its way into
                    Swiss bank accounts. But in any event our relations, given the limitations, were
                    better than with most of the other Warsaw Pact countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there who was our Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Our Ambassador when I arrived was William Schaufele. He had previously
                    served in Africa. I had rather little to do with him, because he retired shortly
                    after my arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you go to the Embassy first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you told about what they hoped they'd get from
                        you and from Krakow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: The trip to the Embassy is a story in itself, but, to answer your
                    question, the Department, specifically EUR/EE, the office which handled
                    relations with East European countries, urged me to report as fully as possible
                    on what was going on at the local level. The Embassy gave me the same mandate,
                    and even authorized me to send my reports directly to the Department through the
                    Embassy's communication facilities, with a copy, of course, to the Embassy.
                    There was this political/social ferment going on in Poland which had attracted
                    the interest of the world.</p>
                <p>When I got there I had constantly to remind myself that I was in a Communist,
                    totalitarian country, because on the person-to-person level, it was as though I
                    were in a Western country. Nobody was afraid to talk to me; in fact, they
                    welcomed me. There didn't seem to be any fear of repression. All sorts of
                    unauthorized publications circulated freely, even though they were really
                    underground literature. It seemed like democracy was establishing itself from
                    the bottom up. This contradicted all of my previous experience in Romania. We
                    had access to just about anyone. One courageous and informative contact I prized
                    especially headed the Krakow branch of the Catholic Intellectual Club, Potocki,
                    if I remember correctly, was his name. He was a member of the expropriated
                    landed aristocracy.</p>
                <p>The Party leaders readily received me for official calls, and our conversations
                    were quite friendly. You would never have guessed that we were on opposite sides
                    in the Cold War. One, the Krakow First Secretary, obviously showed pride as a
                    Pole in the election of Wojtyla as Pope, by telling me a joke. John Paul II had
                    made his first visit just prior to my arrival.</p>
                <p>The story is that the Pope had just taken off in an airliner. The stewardess
                    asked if he'd like a drink. The Pope asked, “What's our altitude now. She said
                    about 5,000 feet, and he accepted the drink. Later, she asked again, got the
                    same question about altitude, and the Pope accepted a second drink. Then, after
                    they were cruising at 30,000 feet, she asked if he wanted another. This time the
                    Pope said, “No, thanks. Too close to the boss.”</p>
                <p>Washington had asked for as much reporting as we could produce, but they also
                    welcomed analysis. In the spring of 1980, I thought that I understood what was
                    going on, and decided to do a think piece. I had concluded that the Communist
                    regime, the Party, was really very clever. They were allowing all this ferment
                    at the local level while retaining, firmly in their hands, all the levers of
                    power. It was a way of letting the populace express its frustrations with the
                    poor consumer situation; let off steam, so to speak, while they made sure it
                    didn't go any farther. Fortunately for me, I never got it written, because I was
                    so busy. Then along came the summer when they tried to raise prices on meat, and
                    the ferment boiled over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about...this is the summer of '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, this is the summer of '80; I got there in the summer of '79.
                    Factories here and there went on strike to protest these increases in the price
                    of meat. Of course the main strike was in Gdansk at the shipyards where Walesa,
                    an electrician who wasn't even working at the time, climbed over the gates to
                    take over the leadership of the strike. He been fired for agitating for an
                    independent trade union and this became the principal demand. His rehiring had
                    been one of the original demands of the strikers. A Committee of Catholic
                    intellectuals formed to advise the strikers; some of them were present even
                    within the shipyards. And then the strikers had the support of Jacek Kuron and
                    his Committee to Defend the Works (KOR), which he with other intellectuals,
                    including Adam Michnik, had formed in the aftermath of the 1976 strikes in Radom
                    which had been brutally suppressed. They had used the Constitution and the laws
                    to defend workers in court, and to raise money for their families. In court they
                    had some success; there were some judges, who went by the evidence and the law
                    rather than what the Party wanted.</p>
                <p>The strikes became so general that at a certain point the regime realized it had
                    to yield; stone-walling, the threat of the use of force, and hints in television
                    addresses by leaders - and even Cardinal Wyszynski - that Poland's national
                    existence was at stake from a Soviet occupation hadn't worked at all. More and
                    more of the economy was paralyzed by the hundreds of strikes. So to end the
                    strikes as quickly as possible, on the 30th of August, the regime gave in to
                    almost all of Solidarity's demands, which, besides an independent labor union,
                    included a number of other non-economic demands like access to the media and
                    broadcast of Mass on Sundays for shut-ins. Of course, the plan was to gradually
                    take it all back, as Gomulka had done after the concessions of 1956. And so, the
                    next evening, August 31, the formal signing at Gdansk was broadcast on national
                    television. Walesa signed with a huge pen. For me it was the single most
                    exciting evening I spent in Poland.</p>
                <p>Around the corner from the residence lived a courageous, dissident professor I
                    admired greatly with a courageous daughter of university age I had come to know
                    reasonably well; she in the park fronting the residence where we both walked our
                    dogs. She had mildly criticized me for keeping my daughter's cocker spaniel on a
                    leash while her large dog walked freely by her side. She really believed in
                    freedom, I mused. Anyway during the strikes this young lady had acted as a
                    courier between striking factories as so many of her fellow students did, since
                    the regime had shut down telephones to isolate them. To stop her and probably
                    keep her father from communicating with strikers, a security police car had been
                    parked in front of their house for about the last 10 days.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Well that night they disappeared and she came into the residence after the
                    signing ceremony was over. My wife and I offered her a glass of champagne - in
                    my elation at the event, I had popped a bottle. She declined and said she didn't
                    believe that the regime's promises would be kept; she wasn't even sure what
                    would happen to her after she left the residence; she didn't want to have
                    alcohol on her breath. And during the first few days, I found that most Poles
                    shared her pessimism. History had made the Poles a fatalistic and pessimistic
                    people. Their hopes for freedom had been so often dashed in the past, that they
                    couldn't believe that Solidarity's victory would last.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In between the Germans and the Russians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. But then the following days the Solidarity movement swept through
                    society like a wind-driven brush fire. The party below the level of the Central
                    Committee crumbled. Party members in droves joined Solidarity, many without
                    giving up their Party membership. For a time, the media seemed to operate with
                    complete freedom; I remember watching a television program in which a woman
                    Communist local official, said: “Isn't it great that words now mean what they
                    say!”</p>
                <p>In the park I met a professor from the Jagiellonian University I knew casually,
                    and he exclaimed: “Isn't it marvelous that 35 years of Communist indoctrination
                    did not make idiots of us all?” For many Poles enthusiasm had replaced
                    pessimism; and I thought how happy I was that I never got to write that analysis
                    in which I concluded that the regime had everything under control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this strike and leading up to it; in the
                        first place, describe the Consulate; how big an office was it? What staff
                        did you have? What were your...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, we had five Americans, including me: a BPAO, that is a Branch
                    Public Affairs Officer, who was number two and headed the Cultural Section, a
                    Political Officer who I had do reporting exclusively, an Administrative officer
                    and a Visa officer. And then we had about 22 Polish employees, Foreign Service
                    Nationals, as they were called.</p>
                <p>It would be well here to briefly describe the history of the Consulate. About
                    1970 we had proposed opening a consulate in Krakow to the Polish government;
                    they were anxious to open another consulate here as well, I think, San
                    Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember interviewing the Polish Consul General back
                        around '75 when I was with the Senior Seminar. He had said “Here I am in
                        Chicago, and I'm covering Alaska and Hawaii and everything, the whole rest
                        of the United States”. They needed to branch out too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. But the regime did nothing without the OK of the Soviets. Anyway,
                    when we asked for Krakow, the answer that came back was; Consulate no, but
                    Cultural Center, OK. At least that is what I recall being told. Len Baldyga, the
                    retired USIA Cultural Officer who established it can give the full story. Vic
                    Grey...do you know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Vic Gray, a Foreign Service Officer, was detailed to the United States
                    Information Agency to establish this Cultural Center. He was tragically killed
                    by a bus while crossing the street as a pedestrian here in Washington after he
                    retired. Anyway, he first worked out of what is still the official residence and
                    established this marvelous Cultural Center practically on the main square, the
                    Glowny Rynek which is a UN recognized world historical site. In fact, the back
                    entrance opened right into the main square. The Consulate is a row house,
                    similar to those we have in Georgetown, with common walls with adjoining
                    buildings; ideal for a cultural center, but a nightmare for physical security
                    officers. Its glass front doors open onto a very busy small street. A constant
                    stream of pedestrians passes by on the sidewalk. One small step across the
                    threshold and you are in the teeming life of Krakow.</p>
                <p>Well, as soon as the flag went up in Southeast Poland from which most of the
                    immigration into the United States had originated, the Poles started flocking to
                    the Consulate asking for visas. Somehow or other the visa work was authorized or
                    allowed without objection by the Polish government. Vic Grey's replacement was
                    an outstanding cultural officer but, quite understandably, didn't know a damn
                    thing about visas. The next thing you know the Department was overwhelmed with
                    protests from Congressmen on behalf of constituents about their Polish relatives
                    being treated like cattle at the Consulate, so the Department decided it had to
                    take it over. A State Foreign Service Officer took over as Consul and Principal
                    Officer. The post officially became a Consulate in 1974, but it was not raised
                    to the status of a Consulate General, until after my departure in '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is about the time you took it over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No. It was Nuel Pazdral. He incidentally is also a private pilot, much
                    more qualified than I. I never met him, but it was his wife who started the
                    English conversation group that my wife took over, and through which she made so
                    many friendships. I replaced Pazdral in 1979 without any overlap.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You've talked about the general strikes that came
                        about in 1980, about the food and price increases, and all the immediate
                        aftermath, but my next question is what were you and your officers doing
                        during the strikes? Were you consulting with the Embassy? Were you all
                        seeing this as a major thing? What were you getting from your contacts? Who
                        were your most important contacts? What was the role of the Cultural Section
                        in all of this? I mean, were you having to be careful not to be out there
                        with a banner leading the way? And then we'll talk about all the elements of
                        Krakow, its importance in the political sphere and economic sphere and
                        cultural sphere and tone of your general work there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: OK. Well that's a pretty big order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carl, do you want to talk about what you all were doing
                        during the strikes? Because this is a pretty exciting and important
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. As the strike became more general and more organized, the eyes of
                    the world were on what was going on in Poland. The regime did start negotiations
                    and they didn't seem to be going anywhere until it became obvious that the
                    strikes were total, almost total, and that they had spread; not just from the
                    shipyards in the Baltic, Gdansk, and Szczecin, but also to major industrial
                    centers, Krakow's Nowa Huta Steel mill, and Silesia, which is Poland's major
                    industrial area, particularly for the mining of coal. We were reporting as much
                    as we could as to what was going on, what was being said.</p>
                <p>The regime, when it saw that the situation was pretty much out of control, and
                    that the news was getting out, despite its cutoff of telephones and
                    communications, decided, all of a sudden, to concede everything it had to to
                    bring the strikes to an end. A Deputy Prime Minister, Jagielski was his name,
                    who in the Polish government was not considered a hardliner handled the final
                    negotiations. Agreement was reached on August 30, and signed with all the nation
                    looking on through television on August 31st. That's why the revolution, and it
                    was truly a revolution, came to be called August 1980. The government caved on
                    just about everything in writing The primary demand of the labor unions was met:
                    to be free of government and party control; to be independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Solidarnosc? Or was it called that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, Solidarnosc, Solidarity. The name arose during the strikes and
                    they organized under the name Solidarnosc. Independent labor unions in a
                    Communist system were a contradiction. Unions are meant to be transmission belts
                    for the orders of the Party to the workers. Solidarity's emergence was in effect
                    a loss of the Polish Workers Party's of monopoly of power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carl, I want to get back to what your Consulate, your
                        officers and all. What were you doing during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: We all became reporting officers. We had access to everybody and
                    anybody; nobody was afraid to talk to us. This was a situation that had existed
                    for some time, as I mentioned earlier, this social/political ferment in which
                    technically illegal newspapers were circulating openly. Also, we were mandated
                    by the Department and the Embassy to check on the availability of food in the
                    stores and open markets. Even our wives contributed, going to markets and noting
                    down prices and availability.</p>
                <p>Now, contrary to standard opinion by experts and analysts on Poland,
                    intellectuals, workers, and peasants did cooperate. There is a traditional
                    division in Poland between the intellectuals, the educated, and the others, a
                    real cultural difference. If one did not speak proper Polish, it was considered
                    a liability. In this regard - I'm jumping out of context here momentarily - I
                    remember about 10 years later, when Walesa was running for President after
                    Communism had collapsed, I received a phone call from a Polish intellectual, a
                    woman who had been active in Solidarity, but had since immigrated to Chicago. By
                    this time too, Solidarity had split, and Walesa was running against a Solidarity
                    intellectual who was Poland's first non-communist Prime Minister. She asked,
                    “Who do you think will win?” And I said, “Walesa, of course; in a landslide.”
                    And she said - I'm sure in all seriousness - “No, no, he can't be President, he
                    does not speak good Polish.”</p>
                <p>But getting back to your original question, we were under pressure to supply as
                    much raw information on the social and economic situation at the people's level
                    to Washington, because there was a real concern that there would be violence
                    over shortages, which would provide a pretext to the Soviets to come in to
                    restore order. Washington's obsessive fear that the Soviets would invade I
                    personally came to regard as exaggerated for reasons I will explain later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Soviet presence wasn't very visible, was it, in
                        Poland, from my understanding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Soviet presence was not very visible at all during this period of
                    ferment. They had a large military base from the time of the Second World War in
                    Southwest Poland but their presence on the streets was not evident, even though
                    their ties to the important Polish Ministries were tight. The way the Soviets
                    controlled these satellites, as I think we properly called them, were primarily
                    direct Party to Party relations; direct Ministry of Interior to Ministry of
                    Interior relations - that is, all central police relations - and direct Ministry
                    of Defense to Ministry of Defense relations. I learned from somewhere that no
                    officer in the military was promoted to colonel without first being vetted by
                    the Soviets. These Ministries were the most important. There were Soviet
                    advisors within the Ministry of Interior of Poland at, I would guess, most
                    levels. International relations were subsumed by the Party to Party relations,
                    except for the formalities which were left to the Foreign Ministries. Proof of
                    Poland's satellite status was that it had no foreign policy of its own. The
                    Soviets pretty much got their way in all of these relations, including
                    trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time, was there, I won't say concern, but
                        questioning about what the Polish army would do? I mean, Poland sits across
                        the supply lines that lead to any attack on Western Europe. In the popular
                        mind, there were questions about the Polish army. What were you were getting
                        from your colleagues and your own information about the Polish Army at this
                        particular stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, the opinion which developed during the legal period of
                    Solidarity, was that the Army was not a reliable instrument the regime could use
                    for a repression. It almost became a given of any analysis that, if the regime
                    decided to quash Solidarity, the military at the lower levels might rebel: and
                    this was seen as a deterrent to resorting to martial law. The military was still
                    viewed by the people as more Polish than Communist. I'm talking now, again, of
                    the lower levels. The Polish uniform was esteemed.</p>
                <p>Also, reportedly, at the time of the workers' violent uprisings in Gdansk in
                    1970, and Radom in 1976, Jaruzelski, who was already head of the Ministry of
                    Defense, had refused to use the army to suppress the strikers. Whether it was
                    because he didn't trust the soldiers or was defending the military's honor, as
                    those who are sympathetic to him claim, is moot.</p>
                <p>The Polish army, of course, was periodically engaged in joint Warsaw Pact
                    maneuvers with the Soviet, Czechoslovak, East German, and, sometimes even the
                    Hungarian, armies So as the situation developed in the so-called legal period of
                    Solidarity when it was recognized as an independent labor union, the Army was
                    always considered an unreliable element for the regime to use to repress them,
                    and therefore an argument against the possibility of an internal repression,
                    which was sort of dismissed as a possibility by Washington analysts.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The legal period was one of repeated confrontations over individual issues;
                    getting registered, getting access to the media, union relations with plant
                    managers who were all appointed by the government, etc. Besides striking and
                    threatening to strike to get the terms of the national, original agreements
                    observed, numerous provincial strikes occurred over local issues, primarily to
                    have entrenched, corrupt Party officials who were Party and Government
                    appointees, removed.</p>
                <p>This period, from September 1980 to December 1980 was exciting, because in these
                    confrontations over specific issues, the Politburat least its liberal majority -
                    did apparently try to find a way of carrying out its commitments to Solidarity
                    without at the same time giving up the Party's so-called leading role.
                    Solidarity had formally accepted the Constitution.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, from the Soviets, Czechoslovaks and, especially, the East Germans,
                    there was an incessant drum beat of calls to reverse “anti-socialist,
                    counter-revolutionary and reactionary” trends in Poland, mixed with ominous
                    hints that if the Polish Party didn't, then they would do it for them. The real
                    revolution had of course had been the “Socialist revolution” immediately after
                    the war when the Soviets made sure it happened. Washington and Europe's fear of
                    an invasion was at its height. In late November 1980, the East Germans closed
                    their border with Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the figuring? In a way this is way above
                        your pay grade, but at the same time you're sitting in the field there; what
                        was your feeling? Because if the Soviets moved in that could well mean
                        fighting with Polish troops, which would mean they might have a major war on
                        their hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In fact, the alleged possibility that the Polish soldiers would resist
                    if the Soviets came in was also considered a deterrent to Soviet military
                    intervention, possibly even by the Soviets themselves. But there is no doubt
                    that the Soviets in the fall seriously did consider an invasion and occupation.
                    They were alarmed in this period at how regularly the regime yielded to the
                    demands of Solidarity. It all came to a head in early December when...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, of 1980. This was a period - late November, early December 198when
                    we had reliable information that the Soviets were massing troops on the Polish
                    border. It was a period of very high tension. In the Carter Administration
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski - a Pole in origin - was the National Security Advisor. Our
                    position was from start to finish that the Poles should be left to work out
                    their internal problems alone, and that, if the Soviets occupied the country, it
                    would inevitably have dire consequences for East-West relations. I'd say most
                    people in Poland and outside of Poland at this time considered a Soviet/Warsaw
                    Pact intervention in Poland almost inevitable.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Now, like you said, this is way above my pay grade but I was following these
                    events day after day, full time, talking to people, reading every analysis which
                    came my way through the media and the pouch. This may sound like blowing my own
                    trumpet, but my own personal analysis was that the Soviets with so many very
                    important irons in the fire with the West, particularly economic...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were in Afghanistan at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They were in Afghanistan, yes, and the Poles were very unhappy about
                    contributing anything to that effort. At the same time the Soviets had so many
                    industrial trade relations going on with the West, the importation of
                    technology, primarily. There was talk of the construction of a pipeline to
                    Western Europe to export gas and oil which would pay for both the pipe line and
                    the technology they needed. If they did to Poland what they did to
                    Czechoslovakia in 1968, they would lose tremendously in the economic sphere.
                    There was no way that the West could have continued relations as they were.</p>
                <p>Anyway, my view was that the Soviets in the end would not invade, because, while
                    intolerable, it wasn't an emergent situation they needed to end from one day to
                    the next. They could afford to bide their time, and make sure their Polish
                    mercenaries backed by fear of an invasion would do their work for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting instructions or was this obvious,
                        having to sit on your officers and all not to get out there and show a
                        little solidarity with Solidarnosc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Nobody was telling us not to associate with Solidarity; nobody was
                    telling us to be cautious or anything of that sort. The Embassy was doing the
                    same thing. When I arrived in Poland I was told that I could report directly to
                    the Department, with a copy to the Embassy. We had to keep real time reporting
                    at an unclassified level, because our only real-time facilities were the
                    telephone and telex, both of which were monitored. The one time I laboriously
                    used the one-time code pad only got me into trouble with the Embassy's
                    communication officer who saw that as a waste of his time. All our sensitive
                    reporting was by pouch to the Embassy. No, there was just Washington's
                    insatiable demand for information on what was going on at the local level in my
                    District, and no restrictions put on whom to talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there can often be a problem with junior officers;
                        they can get pretty enthusiastic about a revolutionary situation, and, you
                        know, overstep the bounds.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, yes. In fact, we had a young woman officer; she had a very strong
                    academic background, spoke Polish very well, and developed very close
                    friendships with Solidarity people. I worried about how close they were at one
                    point, and, tell her not to get too familiar with them. However, her reporting
                    was so good that the Embassy offered her direct transfer to Warsaw's Political
                    Section. She did me an honor by preferring to remain on my staff.</p>
                <p>Our BPAO, Branch Public Affairs Officer, had close relations with the students at
                    the Jagiellonian University - we were within walking distance of the campus. At
                    one point they asked him to drive a student queen into the city on his official
                    Ford station wagon. I put the kibosh on it, somewhat to his dismay. Yes, there
                    was the danger of enthusiastic young officers getting so close to Solidarity
                    that it would support by appearance the charge that we were subverting the Poles
                    against the legitimate authorities. This charge the regime made over and over
                    again in the media and even in some official conversations with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about food? How were food supplies? You were
                        monitoring that, which kicked off this whole thing. In your area what was
                        the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Food was scarce and it's hard for me to separate the food scarcities
                    later during martial law from those that led to the revolution of August 1980.
                    Yes, food was scarce in the lead up to August '80. Poland has enormous
                    agricultural assets, lots of fertile land. When the Communists took over they
                    started to carry out the Leninist plan of collectivization in order to make the
                    agricultural workers dependent on the state for their livelihood, just like the
                    industrial workers. They did collectivize much of the best land, but they never
                    succeeded with the peasants who owned smaller plots of a few acres. Periodically
                    they tried in the early years, but each time they encountered so much resistance
                    that they put it off.</p>
                <p>In the end, most of the agricultural land was never collectivized, and most of
                    the peasantry never became economically dependent on the State for their daily
                    bread and basic needs. So the party was never able to dominate the peasants
                    through party controlled rural organizations as they did the workers through the
                    official unions. And then there was the Church which supported the farmers.
                    Because the non-collectivized farmers were so much more efficient in
                    agricultural production, the State came to depend on them to supply much of the
                    food to the residents of urban areas; that is to the workers, professionals,
                    bureaucrats, and their families. Moreover, many urban residents, workers
                    especially, had migrated from rural areas and retained close family ties there.
                    The food support they received from their relatives also diminished the control
                    the party had over them through official labor unions and party
                    organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>In my view, this is a major reason why, among the satellite nations, Poland led
                    the way in throwing off Communism from below. To put it another way, the
                    Communist-Leninist revolution which makes every individual dependent on the
                    powers that be, and isolates him from his neighbors through fear of
                    collaborators among them, was never completed in Poland. Those foolish enough to
                    resist are made examples through disappearance into camps and severe punishment.
                    They do this not only to those who actively dissent, but, initially, even to
                    those who might resist. This in fact is what happened to so many who had worked
                    in Germany and occupied Europe under the Nazis whom we forced to return to their
                    native East European countries after the war. As soon as they got home, they
                    were shipped off to concentration camps as Western spies. I had met one
                    egregious survivor in Romania.</p>
                <p>This Leninist totalitarian control was never fully established in Poland from the
                    beginning. In fact, as I came to see later under martial law, there were even a
                    few in the security police who didn't enforce the control of Solidarity
                    activists paroled from camps as they were supposed to. They were part of the
                    system of repression, but as Poles, must have salved their consciences in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling about students; as you know, in
                        the Communist world horrendous amounts of time are spent sitting in schools
                        learning Communist economics and all; and yet, with a blink of an eye it all
                        went away. Did you get any feel that there were Poles committed to
                        Communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, the students were among the most rebellious even though they'd
                    been brought up under the Socialism and forced to learn Russian right from
                    elementary school on. Just about every Pole educated after the war spoke
                    Russian, but they resented this, and when Solidarity arose, many students were
                    active in it. During the strikes they ran messages from one plant to another as
                    couriers as Solidarity set up its network. The function was essential, because
                    the first thing the regime did everywhere when workers struck was to shut off
                    all means of communication in the striking areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how Solidarnosc developed. I mean that it was not
                        just a workers' strike in Gdansk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed. By mid -August '80 Solidarity, Solidarnosc, had become a
                    national organization headed by Walesa at the striking shipyards in Gdansk.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Another point I want to stress again is that contrary to the expectations of the
                    Party and some western observers, the intellectuals and peasants and workers
                    actually cooperated during the strikes and throughout the so-called legal period
                    until martial law was imposed; that is between August '80 and December 12, 198l.
                    I can still remember the visit of a Washington intelligence analyst in this
                    period who held the theory that they wouldn't or couldn't cooperate. I had a
                    hard time convincing him that the facts contradicted his theory. They cooperated
                    despite the regime's efforts to provoke animosity between these classes through
                    misinformation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this time, particularly the time of the
                        August revolution, how did you view the role of the Church? Were you able to
                        monitor the Church, Catholic Church leaders, in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Indeed. As is well known, the Church hierarchy in varying degrees
                    supported Solidarity. As the American Consul in Krakow, I was in a particularly
                    advantageous location, because Wojtyla had been the Cardinal at Krakow when
                    elected to the Papacy, and I was talking to his successor, Cardinal Macharski,
                    and his former close collaborators. I had almost immediate access to Cardinal
                    Macharski, even under martial law. My most memorable meeting with him was
                    immediately after it was imposed. He drew me into the corridor and spoke in
                    whispers, warning me that his office was bugged.</p>
                <p>While fully supporting Solidarity's demands, including the right to strike, the
                    Church gave almost overriding priority to making sure that Solidarity avoid
                    violence. I attribute the fact that Solidarity did so largely to the Church's
                    influence. Walesa, who was personally very loyal to the Church, was certainly
                    open to its influence. That Solidarity did consistently avoid violence, in
                    contrast to the workers' protests of 1976 and 1970 proved to be one of its most
                    effective tactics in confrontations with the regime's Security Police.</p>
                <p>Macharski as a national Church leader, second only to the Primate in Warsaw, had
                    to be prudent and circumspect in his public words and actions, indeed like the
                    Pope himself. However, many parish priests who were closest to the workers were
                    as active as local Solidarity leaders were themselves. In the hierarchy, perhaps
                    the most defiant and courageous Bishop was Tokarczuk in the city of Pzemysl
                    close to Lw�w in the Ukraine whose population prior to the war had been over 90%
                    Polish. He was still ministering to underground Catholics there by sending
                    priests secretly across the border. My visit with him when he told me all this
                    was one of the highlights of my tour.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Another relationship I prized was that with the priest philosopher and close
                    collaborator of the Pope in the philosophy of man, Father Jozef Tischner. He was
                    one of Solidarity's closest advisors, and was considered its unofficial
                    chaplain. I will never forget our one and only meeting in my office during that
                    hot autumn of 1980. Then he was convinced that the Soviets would invade. I
                    argued that they wouldn't. I didn't see him more than twice after that, but the
                    last brief encounter on a street in Krakow during one of my long walks shortly
                    after the imposition of martial law is engraved in my memory. We hardly got past
                    greeting each other than he hurried on. Obviously, he had not been interned
                    because he was close to the Pope, but there was no doubt that he was under
                    surveillance when I encountered him.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the Warsaw Pact leaders met in Moscow in early December 1980, and they
                    were divided. The Romanians and Hungarians were definitely against any invasion.
                    The First Secretary, Stanislaw Kania, was accompanied by General Jaruzelski who
                    had long since been Minister of Defense and a member of the Politburo. Kania and
                    Jaruzelski promised that they would roll back Solidarity, and they were told in
                    no uncertain terms to do so by each of the other leaders present.</p>
                <p>From that moment on I don't think the Soviets ever seriously considered military
                    intervention; the solution was going to be internal repression imposed by their
                    Polish mercenaries. During the whole following year of 1981 there was no
                    evidence that they had massed troops on the border as they did that December,
                    but they made no secret of their pressure on the Polish leaders to carry out
                    their plans.</p>
                <p>The next serious crisis developed in March. It was at this time that Cardinal
                    Macharski told me that he no longer considered a Soviet invasion the major
                    threat, but internal repression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: March of '81. At this time the peasants decided they wanted to organize
                    as a sort of green Solidarity, to negotiate their economic needs as an
                    independent union.</p>
                <p>The regime at first stone-walled, but then promised to talk. This was the
                    regime's reaction to any new demand, but, unlike what usually happened in fall
                    of 1980, in 1981 it was no longer certain that talks would end with concessions.
                    In preparing for this session, I reread what I said in a talk I gave at John
                    Carroll University in 1988 about my experiences in Poland, and would like to
                    quote a paragraph of it here:</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>“The totalitarian system seemed impotent, confused, and no longer relevant, but
                    it remained in place. A revolution had been wrought, but it had yet to be
                    consummated. The agreements in Gdansk, Szczecin and with the miners in
                    Jastzembie had been signed, but a protracted struggle was underway to have them
                    implemented. From September 1980 through 1981 the Poles found themselves forced
                    to remake their revolution through successive confrontations with the regime,
                    just to maintain it.”</p>
                <p>And that's exactly what was happening. The leaders of the regime were constantly
                    trying to stonewall, especially after that December 1980 Warsaw Pact meeting. In
                    the period before that - let me backtrack just a bit - between August '80 and
                    December '80 Kania had become the First Secretary, replacing Gierek. His
                    previous job in the Party had included relations with religious and other social
                    organizations. He for a time tried to co-opt the revolution. He talked about
                    renewal, odnowa; how in cooperation with Solidarity and the people, the party
                    was going to rebuild Socialism. Odnowa was a catch word, repeated over and over
                    on every issue; and it was during this period that the leaders more readily
                    yielded to Solidarity's demands, especially those listed in the agreements. They
                    did orally also to demands of provincial organizations all over the country for
                    the removal of corrupt, entrenched government and party officials; but the
                    removal of most was constantly postponed.</p>
                <p>In 1981, after their December 1980 promises to the Soviets that they would roll
                    back Solidarity, they began to try to carry them out. In February of 1981,
                    Solidarity struck the entire province of Bielsko-Biala in my Consular District
                    because the twice-postponed removal of corrupt officials had not happened. This
                    time the regime responded by cutting of communications within and with the
                    entire province, and having the official national media lambast the strikers for
                    the losses they were causing to the economy. The Embassy asked me to find out
                    what was going on. I went there with my wife in the Consulate's big white
                    official car which I drove myself - about an hour's drive. The car made it
                    obvious who we were. We were not stopped and were able to drive freely into and
                    within the city. We saw some armored security police units at the edge of the
                    province on our way in and out, but none within the city or its environs - not
                    even police cars.</p>
                <p>The entire area was at a standstill. Only restaurants were open and only taxi
                    cabs were providing transportation. They charged no fees. The red and white
                    Polish flag and Solidarity signs and logos were everywhere, and displayed in all
                    the store windows. It seemed more like a holiday than a strike. We were treated
                    as honored guests at a restaurant. We stopped at a metal smelting plant and
                    spoke with workers at the gate wearing red and white armbands. It and all the
                    other factories were occupied by the workers. At this one, we were told that
                    they were keeping fires stoked within the smelting furnace to prevent the
                    interior brick walls from cracking if they cooled. In the end the Prime
                    Minister, Pinkowski, who had authority over the contested government positions,
                    yielded. But this time the Party fired him, and replaced him with
                    Jaruzelski.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Incidentally, this Solidarity tactic of occupation strikes in the factories, and
                    not going into the streets to demonstrate, made it much easier for them to avoid
                    violence by any of their members, and much harder for the regime to use it to
                    end strikes.</p>
                <p>Okay. Picking up where I left off about the demand of the peasants in March '81
                    to form their own rural Solidarity, their leaders were invited to attend a
                    meeting of the local city council in Bydgoszcz in central Poland. However, at
                    the meeting no substantive discussion was permitted; after a standoff the
                    peasant leaders and Solidarity union representatives supporting them were
                    escorted out where they were severely beaten by security police in mufti. At
                    this time much of the press was still operating freely and the Politburo - o's
                    immediate cover story blaming the violence on Solidarity was soon exposed.
                    Gazeta Krakowska, officially the Party's local organ, took the lead. It sent its
                    own correspondent to Bydgoszcz and published the full story with pictures of the
                    beaten Solidarity people in the hospital.</p>
                <p>Almost overnight, the entire country was enraged. Never since immediately after
                    August '80 were the people in the vast majority so united behind Solidarity.
                    Shortly before, there had been the news that joint Warsaw Pact military
                    maneuvers of Soviet, East German, Czechoslovak and Polish military forces would
                    begin about the middle of the month. Walesa and the leaders of Solidarity met,
                    and decided on a national warning strike near the end of March to be followed by
                    a full strike a few days later if a series of demands were not met. Walesa and
                    the Party's most liberal leader by reputation, Mieczyslaw Rakowski negotiated
                    openly; he was then a Deputy Prime Minister in the government. I recall that at
                    least one of meetings was held on an open stage on national television.</p>
                <p>In Krakow, Solidarity leaders were convinced that the Soviet Army would move in.
                    They counseled against direct resistance, but distributed leaflets on how to
                    resist passively, like taking down or reversing street signs. At the same time,
                    in the expectation of violence, they had hospital emergency wards prepared to
                    give emergency care to large numbers. By this time, Jaruzelski was also the
                    Prime Minister. But he played no visible role in this crisis. While his Deputy
                    negotiated with Walesa, he was off participating in the joint Soyuz,
                    “Friendship”, maneuvers, as they were called.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that Kania and Jaruzelski were at this time under enormous
                    pressure from the Soviets to carry out their commitment to crush Solidarity, and
                    the Bydgoszcz events may have been contrived to force their hand. The military
                    maneuvers had apparently been timed to serve as a backup to intimidate
                    Solidarity and the people. The Bydgoszcz incident was also intended to show that
                    the Party was putting Solidarity in its place. For the regime, it proved a
                    colossal blunder. In the end they agreed to Solidarity's demands for talks to
                    establish an agricultural Solidarity union, and investigation and punishment of
                    those responsible for the beatings.</p>

                    <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the agricultural group, I take it these would be the
                        collective farmers, not the individual peasant landholders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, on the contrary; it was the individual, independent peasants who
                    wanted to have their own organization. The collective farm people were pretty
                    subservient to the regime. An oddity here is that the individual peasants
                    out-produced the collective farms by a great margin, despite the fact that the
                    collective farms had prime land and received all they needed from the Government
                    in the way of equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is true all the time. And how as part
                        of our diplomatic establishment in Poland, did you view Jaruzelski and his
                        rule early on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: As I put it in a piece I wrote after retirement, when Jaruzelski was
                    appointed Prime Minister without giving up his military positions, the Polish
                    people extended to him a line of credit, so to speak, as a leader - this is very
                    much my own way of putting it. They hoped that his “Polishness” would assert
                    itself. After all, he was from a landed wealthy family in Eastern Poland which
                    sent its sons to the Army or the Church. He had been educated in a Catholic
                    boarding school; he spoke good Polish; and his wife was a practicing Catholic.
                    He was head of the military, and the Polish army retained respect among the
                    people. And there was the story that, as a member of the Politburo, he had
                    prevented the use of the Army against the workers in the 1970 Gdansk uprising.
                    So there was hope that he would find some kind of solution to the struggle
                    between Solidarity - that is, really between the vast majority of the people -
                    and the regime subservient to the Soviets. For the people from time immemorial,
                    the primary enemy of the Polish nation, the nar�d, had been the Russians.</p>
                <p>As I saw it, all he had to do was show in some way that he was defending Polish
                    national interests vis-�-vis the Soviets. None but a very few were looking for
                    open defiance. I had seen how the otherwise execrable Ceausescu had done it. He
                    never ceased to harp on the rhetorical boiler plate in fashion among the
                    so-called “socialist states” of independent ways to Socialism and Equality among
                    countries, while doing to the extent possible what in his view served Romania's
                    national interests; ignoring, or finding ways to put off, Soviet demands which
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>Jaruzelski did none of that, absolutely none of that. Instead, when he came in
                    there was a clumsy attempt to present him to our posts in Poland and the world
                    as a popular national leader. To my amazement, we were given the results of a
                    so-called poll by contacts who came into our posts at about the same time which
                    allegedly showed that he was more popular with the Polish people than Walesa. I
                    had witnessed myself the adulation bestowed on Walesa by the people and knew how
                    ridiculous this was.</p>

                <p>Jaruzelski made televised visits that winter to rural areas which showed him
                    guaranteeing food and coal supplies to the peasants. There were in fact dire
                    shortages. But he went over, you know, like a lead balloon. He spoke haltingly;
                    the people stood there stiffly and expressionless; and there was no sign of any
                    rapport.</p>
                <p>There was even a foolish attempt to compare him favorably as a popular leader to
                    Pilsudski; Pilsudski was the one...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marshal Pilsudski, prior to World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: During and after World War II; yes, Pilsudski was largely responsible
                    for putting Poland back on the map when he defeated the new Soviet army in the
                    battle of the Vistula (Wisla) river, just outside Warsaw - the so-called miracle
                    of the Wisla, and sent them fleeing all the way back to Moscow. It was
                    incredible that they tried to do this; Pilsudski is the last person the Russians
                    would like to be reminded of. So promoting Jaruzelski in this manner ended
                    abruptly.</p>
                <p>As Prime Minister Jaruzelski gave a few well-phrased, moderate speeches, but
                    there was no evidence that he was leading as the Prime Minister in negotiations
                    with Solidarity. I've mentioned his absence on maneuvers during the Bydgoszcz
                    crisis. Later, he took no visible role in important negotiations with Solidarity
                    over how factory managers would be appointed, and the union's relations with
                    them. When I mentioned this once - I think to a Church figure - the comment was
                    that two of his predecessors had soon disappeared after becoming identified with
                    recent debacles, so he was wise to keep a low profile.</p>
                <p>The other major objective of the Party and the Soviets was to rebuild the Party
                    in Poland. To do that, they had to maintain the orthodox hardliners in their
                    positions in the leadership and in the Central Committee. For this reason, the
                    Party's extraordinary National Congress at which well-intentioned liberals at
                    the base hoped to make it more democratic after August 1980 was constantly
                    postponed. Many party members had actually joined Solidarity. It was originally
                    due to be held at the end of 1980 or early '81.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Polish National Communist Party Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, the Polish Workers Party Congress which was the Communist Party.
                    So, with Kania's help, hardliners managed to get it put it off until July 1981.
                    But prior to it, in June, hardliners led by Tadeusz Grabski, tried to take over
                    the leadership from Kania and Jaruzelski at a Party Plenum with the open support
                    of the Soviets. They have these Party plenums of the leadership with the Central
                    Committee every two or three months. The main business at this Plenum was an
                    open letter from the Soviet party in which Kania and Jaruzelski were criticized
                    by name for allowing this counter-revolution, as they called it, to continue.
                    After Kania and Jaruzelski had postponed imposing martial law in March as
                    planned and made concessions to Solidarity, the Soviets had apparently lost
                    faith in them.</p>
                <p>The annals of that Plenum make incredible reading. Beginning with Kania, one
                    speaker after another gets up and acknowledges the criticism in the letter as
                    one hundred percent correct, and pledges that the Party will amend its ways.
                    Neither Kania nor Jaruzelski said a word in their own defense; Jaruzelski didn't
                    speak at all. It was left to Kazimierz Barcikowski, to say anything in their
                    defense. Barcikowski was a Party Secretary from the Krakow area and a key member
                    of the liberal group. I had met him early in my tour. I remember he received me
                    casually, wearing slippers, and that the conversation was pleasant and
                    unremarkable. But nothing else. In the end, this blatant Soviet attempt to have
                    hardliners replace Kania and Jaruzelski failed. The forthcoming Party Congress
                    was the excuse used to put off any leadership changes at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I would say that by that by this time Communism, Soviet-style socialism
                    had lost all credibility, not only with the people but with most of the Party.
                    In the paper I wrote about him, I described Jaruzelski as the last of the true
                    believers that Soviet-style socialism was good for the Polish people. He was not
                    corrupt in the normal sense of the word. He believed in the ideology. It had
                    become a political faith for him; and he was loyal to it right up to the end. I
                    don't believe most of the Politburo really believed in the ideology any longer.
                    But since their personal survival as Soviet mercenaries depended on carrying out
                    Soviet demands, they had no alternative. The most the so-called liberals did was
                    postpone the repression, despite Soviet pressure, until their planning was
                    complete and they no longer saw any way of getting Solidarity to give up its
                    gains voluntarily through fear of a Soviet intervention.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of looking at this as almost a spiritual thing,
                        because Communism in a way is a belief - you can call it a religion or
                        whatever - but it's a belief. And you had this whole area in the Soviet
                        Union and in the satellites where by this time generations were moving into
                        power which had gone through the full Communist educational system - and it
                        didn't take at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, particularly in Poland for some of the reasons that I mentioned
                    earlier, where they were never able to establish the totalitarian system
                    completely. But originally yes, there were probably quite a few believers in
                    Communism immediately after the war. Never a majority, never a majority, but
                    there were people who saw “socialism” as a solution to their economic and social
                    problems. But by this time, by I would say the late '60s, mid '70s, most of this
                    faith was gone and many people were Communists because it was the only way you
                    could get ahead and support your family. There was no alternative to working
                    within the system to get ahead. I sometimes wonder what I would have done in a
                    similar situation. Only heroes have the guts to sacrifice and resist when the
                    situation seems hopeless.</p>
                <p>Here I'm reminded of what a courageous professor who lived round the corner from
                    the residence told a New York Times reporter, John Darton, I believe: “Socialism
                    is a system which strives mightily to resolve problems which don't exist in
                    other systems.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I got there in mid '79 and all hell broke loose in mid '80. As I say in
                    a paper in which I review the whole period I was there, a ferment was going on
                    for a long time, and the question was what would come of it? Would it boil over?
                    By the summer of 1980 I had reached the conclusion that it would not. I had
                    decided that the regime was very clever; they maintained all the levers of power
                    firmly in their hands, and allowed all this unorthodox activity at the
                    people-to-people level to go on as a way of releasing their frustrations -
                    letting off steam - but nothing was really going to change. Fortunately for me,
                    I hadn't found the time to write this up and send it in to the Department before
                    it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To a certain point, you can play this game, but it does
                        lead to eventual collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It does indeed, and when it collapses, it collapses like a house of

                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well the question, whither Poland, was constantly on our minds. Within
                    the Embassy I did not detect prior to August 1980 any real belief that this
                    thing was going to end in revolution as it did. And when it did, it surprised
                    the whole world. After all, all previous post-war uprisings in Poland and the
                    other satellites had come to naught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you never know in things like this when a really
                        popular movement gets going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The leadership knows there's discontent, but doesn't know what to use against the
                    will of people. I mean, it's just like when the Soviet Union collapsed; it's the
                    same thing. All of a sudden the will was gone at the top.</p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I like to say that from one day to the next all of the experts on
                    Eastern Europe suddenly became amateurs, because all of their expectations had
                    been deceived.</p>
                <p>I also came to realize that for totalitarian regimes, a little liberalism is a
                    dangerous thing. When people see that dissidence is no longer ruthlessly
                    repressed, they will let their will be known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there until when, '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, until mid '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-three. So what happened; were the screws gradually
                        tightened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, let me continue from the summer of 1981. This all important Party
                    Congress which could have changed the party from an orthodox one to one
                    genuinely social democratic was finally held. Prior to the Congress, many party
                    members had joined Solidarity, and started the so-called lateral movement to
                    reform the Party from the bottom into a genuinely social democratic party. They
                    were crushed. Even though Kania with his high sounding promises of renewal
                    stayed on as First Secretary, the orthodox hardliners remained in positions of
                    power. The reason why the Congress which was supposed to be held in early '81
                    had been repeatedly postponed was to insure this result on which the Soviets
                    were insisting.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>During July-August I was back here on home leave. When I returned a month later I
                    immediately saw that a total change in the political/social environment had
                    taken place. By this time, the regime had succeeded in regaining control of all
                    the media. Solidarity was constantly being blamed for the economic problems and
                    shortages in food and coal. The regime had dropped the pretense of good faith
                    negotiations with Solidarity to resolve them. I was told by a Solidarity leader
                    in Krakow that a party negotiator had confided to him that his instructions were
                    to meet - but to concede nothing. In fact, I was then getting reports that the
                    regime was deliberately withholding perishable food in warehouses even to the
                    point where it spoiled, rather than allowing distribution to the stores. One
                    particular province was a notorious example. Tons of butter had gone rancid on
                    the shelves because the regime had not allowed it to be put out into the stores.
                    In the media, failures to reach agreements on these local issues were always
                    blamed on intransigence on the part of Solidarity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the Voice of America and BBC? Were they
                        able to get this news and were they listened to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: They were getting the news and they were listened to. However, Radio
                    Free Europe, RFE, was really the best at this. They used to get local news from
                    people in Poland like Reuters and Associated Press gets theirs world-wide from
                    stringers. RFE was broadcasting it to the Poles like a local network. They had
                    great credibility and were very much listened to. RFE played the role in Poland
                    of the voice of a responsible opposition in a democratic country, exposing the
                    shortcomings of the powers that be. And that's why the regime's misinformation
                    was not believed by most Poles. Because of VOA and the BBC as well, but they
                    focused more on presenting the views of the West and what was going on in the
                    rest of the world.</p>
                <p>The next great event occurred in September of 1981 when Solidarity held its
                    National Congress with delegates elected locally from all over Poland. It was
                    without a doubt the most democratic convention held in all East Europe since
                    before the war. No union in a Western country could have done it more
                    democratically. They met for two or three weeks, they actively debated, they
                    voted and majority decisions were accepted by the minority. To me it was an
                    edifying model of democracy in action.</p>
                <p>And at this convention, Solidarity proposed solutions for the problems of the
                    Polish economy. The regime accused Solidarity of violating its status as a
                    union, becoming a political party, and wanting to take over the Government.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>During the Congress, Solidarity adopted a message of greetings to workers in the
                    Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact countries supporting efforts among them
                    for union autonomy. This set off a firestorm of criticism against them from the
                    Party and the regimes of all these countries. This was truly frightening to the
                    other satellite leaders and the Soviet Union, because the last thing they
                    wanted, the one thing they were anxious to avoid, was workers following
                    Solidarity's example in their own countries. Solidarity was accused of
                    imperiling Poland's statehood and interference in the internal affairs of its
                    allies. It was seen as proof of the charge that it didn't want to cooperate with
                    the Government, but take it over.</p>
                <p>In fact, Solidarity had accepted the position of Poland within the Warsaw Pact;
                    they weren't calling for Poland to change its international policy and
                    international alliance. But this appeal to workers in other bloc countries was
                    considered a major mistake of Solidarity - even by well-intentioned Solidarity
                    advisors and most Western analysts, and they did not pursue it. It gave occasion
                    to the regime to accuse Solidarity of wanting to change the political system, of
                    anti-Sovietism, and counter-revolution, their favorite charges.</p>
                <p>The Convention ended peacefully but the provocations, the bad mouthing of
                    Solidarity went on increasingly, and I think everybody had a sense that a crisis
                    was building.</p>
                <p>In October, Jaruzelski becomes the First Secretary of the Party, replacing Kania.
                    Now he's got every position of power and, in my analysis, he was the one man who
                    could have effected a peaceful transition to a mild form of democratic socialism
                    within the communist world without giving the Russians any pretext to
                    invade.</p>
                <p>I considered it a kind of analytical advantage to have once been a specialist on
                    Romanian affairs, because I saw how well Ceausescu had been able to utilize the
                    ideology and the opportunities available to him to keep the Soviets from ever
                    coming back into Romania, and to get away with his trade with the West,
                    relations with Israel, and so many other things that were contrary to Soviet
                    dictates for the bloc countries.</p>
                <p>If Jaruzelski, with all the assets he had, and with all the support he would have
                    gotten from the Polish people; had he publicly stated in a non-adversarial
                    manner - you know, using that ideological boilerplate regarding relations
                    between Socialist countries, “equality, autonomy, separate roads to Socialism”,
                    and all that, while reaffirming loyalty to the Warsaw Pact - had he done this,
                    the Soviets would have been left with no ideological pretext to use for
                    invading. And privately he could have hinted to the Soviets that he might not be
                    able to prevent open resistance to an invasion by the lower levels of the Polish
                    Army and Solidarity.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Had he done this, Jaruzelski would have had the support, I'd say, of 80 to 90
                    percent of the Polish people, and been able to effect a transition to a limited,
                    but genuine, form of social democracy in which the Party no longer had a total
                    monopoly of power. And Solidarity would have accepted it, I'm sure. But he did
                    not; he remained the obedient mercenary of the Soviet Union, bent on finally
                    achieving the rollback that he had promised.</p>
                <p>I had alluded earlier to the fact that the core leadership was divided between
                    liberals, including Jaruzelski, and hardliners. However, they were not divided
                    in their objective; they were just divided in how they were going to accomplish
                    it. What the liberals were trying to do was get Solidarity itself to accept the
                    rollback, to return voluntarily to subservience.</p>
                <p>The device they put forth to accomplish this was the organization of a Front of
                    National Accord to advise the leadership. This Front, a so-called Council, would
                    be made up of Solidarity, the regime unions and just about every other
                    organizations subservient to the Party, all with equal status. And the Front's
                    power would only be advisory. If Solidarity had accepted this, they would have
                    given up most of the gains that they had made in the agreements of August
                    1980.</p>
                <p>This solution was promoted by a high profile meeting between the Cardinal who
                    succeeded Wyszynski when he died, Cardinal Glemp, Jaruzelski, and Walesa. Glemp,
                    and therefore the Church because he was the Primate, for a time actively tried
                    to mediate some sort of solution along these lines - so much so that some
                    Solidarity people criticized him for being red as a Cardinal in more than one
                    sense. He was in no sense pro-regime, but somewhat authoritarian, and did not
                    show a whole lot of sympathy for Walesa and Solidarity. In this regard, I
                    noticed, that, though the majority of the Polish people rightly saw the Church
                    as their supporter, they gave priority to the interests of their autonomy as
                    Poles, the nar�d, the nation, when they perceived the Church as not supportive
                    enough on an issue. In the end, this solution was generally seen as a ploy by
                    the people, was rejected by Solidarity, and came to naught.</p>
                <p>And another measure that the regime attempted at this time was to get the Sejm,
                    the Parliament, to authorize emergency measures it viewed necessary, in other
                    words, martial law, allegedly, to restore social peace and salvage the
                    economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was S-E-M-J, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: S-E-J-M, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was the Polish Parliament.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Which was the Polish Parliament. In Parliament the Church as well as
                    Solidarity, opposed a law to allow these measures, and it too came to nothing.
                    And that's why, when they finally did impose martial law they tried to justify
                    it constitutionally under the article that authorized a “state of war,” stan
                    wojenny, as though the country had been or was about to be invaded. Of course,
                    the only ones threatening invasion were their socialist brethren, the Soviets,
                    East Germans, and Czechoslovaks.</p>
                <p>To summarize, it had become increasingly obvious from August '81 that a countdown
                    to the imposition of martial law was underway. At the same time, Solidarity was
                    organizing its own National Convention which took place in September. They had
                    been formally legalized as an autonomous labor union, and had to maintain this
                    public stance. But in reality, shortly after August '80, they had become a
                    national revolutionary movement supported by up to 90% of the people. Early the
                    next year, early 1982, local elections were due to take place and Solidarity by
                    September, having despaired of getting the Government to reach an agreement
                    which honored their gains in the August '80 settlement, had decided that they
                    would bring about change legally from the bottom by winning these local
                    elections.</p>
                <p>I think when this intention of Solidarity became clear the regime realized it had
                    to move up the date for the imposition of martial law. Apparently they hadn't
                    originally intended to impose it until after the end of 1981, but in early
                    December the situation heated up enormously because of their provocations and
                    Solidarity's reactions to them, including the threat of a national strike on
                    December 17. I think the provocations were intended to get these reactions from
                    Solidarity as proof of the charge that Solidarity was violating its legal status
                    as a union only, and was trying to take over the Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1980...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: December 12th and 13th 1981. The arrests of Solidarity activists
                    country-wide began during the night of Saturday the 12th, but Jaruzelski's
                    speech imposing martial law wasn't broadcast until early Sunday morning, the
                    13th. It was a gloomy, smoggy morning in Krakow. I somehow learned of it quite
                    early in the morning. The phones were cut off, so I went by car to each of the
                    Consulate officers' homes to tell them the news, and called a meeting later that
                    morning at the Consulate. The streets were absolutely abandoned, nobody was out
                    except some very elderly people with red armbands; these were the old guard, I
                    guess, of the Communist party. They were out there, I assume as the eyes and
                    ears of the regime. I don't recall seeing any troops in the center of
                    Krakow.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>At the Consulate I got word that the woyewoda, the prefect of the Krakow
                    woyew�dstwo, province, wanted me and the French Consul General to meet with him
                    that afternoon. France was the only other Western country with a Consulate in
                    Krakow at the time; it had the status of a Consulate General, even though it had
                    only two officers. In a polite and sorrowful tone, the prefect explained that
                    the government had been forced to impose martial law; and that, for our own
                    protection, we could no longer travel freely outside the city; that to travel
                    anywhere else we needed an authorization in writing from him.</p>
                <p>I remember seeing the French Consul General diplomatically nodding in an “I
                    understand” way. I on the other hand had been fuming internally as I listened.
                    Indeed, I had been fuming all morning since I found I couldn't call any of the
                    other American officers on the phone who resided elsewhere in the city. They had
                    cut off all our communications with the outside world, consular and residential.
                    So speaking as calmly as I could, I said in substance: “You have just said this
                    is a purely internal situation in Poland. However, we have an international
                    agreement; we have a formal, signed, international consular agreement with
                    Poland. Under international law, international agreements take precedence over
                    local laws and situations. Under this consular agreement, I am entitled to
                    continue traveling freely within my Consular District. Therefore, we will
                    continue to do so. Moreover, under international law the Polish government is
                    responsible for our safety, and I have full confidence in your ability to
                    provide it.” This took him aback. I was spouting all this diplomatic stuff about
                    international law of which he obviously knew nothing. He didn't argue. I'm sure
                    he realized he had to consult. And so that's how the meeting ended.</p>
                <p>And for about a week, we traveled freely. I either would go out myself with one
                    other, or send others in pairs, every day to a different part of the Consular
                    District which was the whole southeast quadrant of Poland, to see what was going
                    on and write a report. There were five of us. Guards stood outside our door. No
                    Poles were admitted, but American citizens were. There was no more visa work,
                    there was no more cultural work; every American officer suddenly became a
                    reporting officer.</p>
                <p>Then one day I had to drive alone to the city of Katowice about an hour's drive
                    west to pick up two officers who were stranded there. All four tires of their
                    car had been slashed. I don't recall how I got the word, probably from someone
                    they had asked to carry it to the Consulate; it certainly wasn't by phone. A few
                    days later, our Branch Public Affairs USIS officer and his wife on their way to
                    Vienna were stopped well before they reached the border and forced to open the
                    trunk of their car, contrary to the diplomatic privileges we enjoyed. With
                    distant hindsight, I now think they were probably making sure our officer wasn't
                    helping some Solidarity activist they were searching for leave the country. We
                    were being harassed, and I realized that, under protest, we would have to file
                    for authorization to travel outside of Krakow.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>As it turned out the only permission they would grant for about six weeks or
                    more, was directly to the Embassy in Warsaw. So we ran pouches of our reports
                    and APO mail to the Embassy about twice a week in the middle of winter, and
                    brought back pouches, mail and supplies, including food, on the return trip a
                    day later. Five or six road blocks along the way during which our authorization
                    was checked turned what was normally a four or five hour drive into a seven or
                    eight hour drive. There were sometimes lengthy waits while those manning the
                    blocks checked with their centers by radio.</p>
                <p>How the road blocks were manned provided abundant proof that the security police,
                    not the military as was alleged, were really running martial law. Two of them
                    sat in their cruiser with the engine running to keep warm, while a lowly soldier
                    took our authorization to them without looking at it, and returned it to us
                    after approval. There wasn't a military officer in sight. The soldier was under
                    the command of the security police.</p>
                <p>My most memorable courier run was the one I did myself with our FSN
                    administrative driver on return from the Embassy with the Consulate's suburban
                    vehicle loaded with our APO packages and mail just before Christmas. We had made
                    it through to Kielce, about an hour north of Krakow, when we were stopped by
                    security policemen in mufti. I don't recall seeing any soldiers. The one we
                    spoke with through the window had an automatic weapon slung across his chest,
                    and in no uncertain terms, ordered us to return to Warsaw. The authorization we
                    showed him didn't impress him at all. With all those APO Christmas packages and
                    perishables for the staff in the suburban - it was loaded to the gills - I
                    wasn't about to.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, before martial law was imposed, I had made an official call on the
                    wojewoda of the Kielce province who was the First Secretary of the Party as
                    well, and still remembered his name. It had been a rather pleasant encounter. I
                    insisted that he be called, as though we were friends. My driver who did some
                    interpreting for me volunteered no comment. Well, I don't know how long the
                    standoff lasted - prolonged I'm sure because all this was happening late at
                    night - but finally, we were brusquely waved through.</p>
                <p>Getting back to the permission business, despite the fact that the woyewoda had
                    made it clear, even explicitly, that the only permission you're going to get is
                    to Warsaw, I put in a request almost every single day to go to a different place
                    in the Consular District, all of which were turned down. I did this on my own
                    authority, since I couldn't consult with the Embassy anyway on a real time
                    basis. I found liked being able to operate throughout this period as my own boss
                    without consulting my superiors in Warsaw. I think we got up to about 15
                    refusals before it was all over. I was building a case for a demarche based on
                    international law through the Embassy to the Foreign Ministry, if I could
                    convince the Embassy to make it. No additional travel restrictions had been
                    placed on Polish diplomats in the U.S. The issue became moot after the
                    restrictions were later dropped.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>One day in this period, the local party newspaper, Gazeta Krakowska, headlined a
                    story about the visit of the Soviet Consul General to the city of Tarn�w, about
                    an hour's drive to the East. With a copy in hand I made a demarche on the
                    Prefect to ask how he had approved his travel and wouldn't approve mine. He had
                    no answer, but didn't change the policy toward us either. The fanfare visit of
                    the Soviet Consul General to Tarn�w showed who really was running things in
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>Mention of our administrative FSN who drove for me on that return from Warsaw in
                    the suburban reminds me of one more thing that happened that fateful Sunday
                    morning in Krakow. We knew he worked for both sides. That day - I think it was
                    while I was meeting with the Prefecwithout any by-your-leave from me or any
                    American officer, he had put up a sign on the glass front door, saying the
                    Consulate was closed until further notice. When I saw it, I ripped it down and
                    replaced it with one saying we were open as usual, and confronted him. I really
                    laid into him, and was close to firing him on the spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these communist countries you have sort of embedded
                        spies, you might say, but this was also a way of getting information to the
                        other side you would like them to have, so they played a useful role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, this guy was particularly resourceful in getting things we needed
                    locally - I think because of his connections with the other side - so I
                    restrained myself.</p>
                <p>Even before my arrival, he regularly took orders for meat from the American
                    officers and delivered them on a weekly basis. Any cut was available; I've never
                    had before or since better pork loin roasts. I'm sure he got the meat from the
                    special stores to which only the security people and high party officials had
                    access. Well, because of the scarcity of meat and other food under martial law
                    when supplies worsened, most of our FSNs were losing a lot of work time standing
                    in lines to buy food. I asked him to do the same for the FSNs on a reduced basis
                    as he did for the Americans. He did, and I'm sure he got his cut, but it was a
                    great boon both for the Consulate and the employees.</p>
                <p>It was essential that we remain open under martial law because we had a fair
                    number of American citizens residing in Krakow for whom we were responsible
                    under our consular mandate. Many were medical or other faculty students of
                    Polish ethnic origin at the local universities, who were suddenly isolated from
                    the world, like ourselves, but without our access to Embassy and APO
                    communication facilities. There were well over 50 students. Early on I had a
                    meeting set up in the Consulate for all Americans residing in the District, and
                    told them we would help them as much as we could. We made sure they all
                    registered with us. That is about the only genuine consular work we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Using my own U.S. stamps, I even pouched their personal mail to their families
                    who were frantically asking the American Services office in the Department for
                    news about their welfare. I put my own American stamps on the letters, and sent
                    them in fat envelopes to the country desk in the Department, so that the desk
                    would have nothing more to do than drop them in the mail. That got me into
                    trouble with the desk and the Embassy for misusing the APO pouch which was
                    restricted to USG employees by agreement with the Defense Department. I was
                    ordered to end the practice and did. In hindsight, I now see that I should have
                    addressed the packets containing the students' letters to the American Services
                    Section in the Department, and said nothing to the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having the problems during the martial law of
                        delivering checks to Polish pensioners, Social Security, and that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: That was all suspended for several months. We normally did that through
                    the mail which for some weeks at least did not function after the imposition of
                    martial law. All the telephones were down in Poland for I don't know exactly how
                    long, longer in the areas where pockets of workers were still resisting. But
                    even after they were restored within Krakow for the citizens, they were still
                    cut off for the Consulate and our homes for some time longer.</p>
                <p>I assumed that what they were trying to do was get us to close the Consulate by
                    our own decision. The security police, I'm sure, had had that sign put up on our
                    door the day of martial law itself. I think the reason for that was they didn't
                    want us to see what they were doing to their own people; they didn't want people
                    talking to us. And so they made this obvious effort first to close us down, and
                    then to induce us, through lack of communications and contact with the people,
                    to close the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they put a guard outside the Consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. They put guards outside my house as well, the official residence.
                    One of the reasons for that, I'm sure is that, Gil - I can't remember his first
                    name - the Solidarity union leader at the Nowa Huta steel mill had not been
                    apprehended, and they had the idea that we might be giving him asylum in the
                    Consulate or the residence. My best evidence of that is that one evening, after
                    dark, I emerged from the garage under my house to the sidewalk for some reason.
                    The guards immediately rushed over from the front gate and grabbed me, thinking
                    I was Gil. They backed off immediately when they saw who I was. Also, one local
                    Solidarity leader on the lam did get into the Consulate through our back gate
                    which opened onto the main square which apparently at first wasn't guarded. We
                    never used it, and kept it permanently shut. We persuaded him to leave the same
                    way, since there was nothing we could do for him. They weren't shooting
                    Solidarity activists on sight; only interning them in camps as they did
                    thousands. On second thought, this guy may have been an agent from Gil to ask
                    whether he could come in for asylum...I don't recall the details.</p>
                <p>But the main reason they had these guards there was to keep Poles and other
                    country nationals out. I was so afraid that the Department and the Embassy might
                    decide to pull us out on hardship grounds that I kept telling the Embassy it was
                    absolutely essential we keep this Consulate open. Ambassador Meehan got so fed
                    up with me harping on this, that he told one of our officers to tell me on his
                    return from a courier run to the Embassy, that we'll close the Embassy before we
                    close the Consulate in Krakow. So that put my mind at rest on the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. We're talking about when martial law was imposed and the
                        problem about closing the Consulate. Then we'll talk more about your
                        contacts and keep going from there. Today is the 15th of April, the Ides of
                        April, 2008. Carl, was there steady stream of people into the Consulate, or
                        were people shying away from you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: After the imposition of martial law we didn't see any Poles at all for
                    quite some time. They were prevented from entering. We dealt immediately with
                    Americans who were not prevented from entering, a fairly large number given
                    where we were. There were well over 50 students studying at local universities,
                    and a few others, including a university professor from John Carroll University
                    in Cleveland on a Fulbright Exchange program. He himself was of Polish origin,
                    born in the States but emotionally attached to Poland. To this day he remains a
                    good friend. Later on some Poles were permitted entry, and were quite brave in
                    doing so because there was a window on the second floor of the shops opposite
                    the Consulate through which the security observed and presumably photographed
                    visitors to the Consulate. All the other windows on the second floor were
                    painted over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did this all last?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: The severe restrictions lasted about six weeks. I regret I can't give a
                    precise date. Restrictions on travel within the consular district lasted some
                    months longer. It was only after the regime was convinced it had overcome all
                    remaining resistance that they were removed. There had been active resistance in
                    the Katowice area and Silesia which were in the eastern part of the consular
                    district. Silesia was the center for coal mining. In Katowice there was a huge
                    white elephant steel mill built by Gierek when he was First Secretary. The coal
                    mines at Jastzebie in Silesia is where the strongest resistance took place. That
                    resistance went on for at least a couple of weeks but it was the only place in
                    Poland that I recall where there was real resistance of this sort. We had
                    estimates of deaths from 8 to considerably more when the striking miners were
                    assaulted by the security police utilizing tanks.</p>
                <p>Getting back to communications, I forgot to mention that we also had an army
                    surplus transmitter-receiver that had been given us by the Embassy for use in
                    emergencies. They had given it to us before martial law without going through
                    the diplomatic channel to obtain official approval for it. Well, we at the
                    Consulate set this radio up in the attic with an inside antenna - the roof was
                    made of tiles, which do not block radio waves. While in the seminary before
                    entering the Foreign Service, I had acquired a ham radio license, so I knew
                    enough about the technology to set up this dipole antenna within the attic so
                    that it could not be seen from the outside. We American officers took turns
                    talking to the Embassy on this radio in pig Latin and slang to report some
                    things informally on a real time basis and our personal and administrative
                    needs. While martial law had made social/political/economic officers of us all,
                    it took at least a week for our typed cables to be pouched and run up to the
                    embassy through all these road blocks.</p>
                <p>Well, you can't control where radio waves bounce to. They hit the ionosphere and
                    do multiple bounces in all directions. Now this I didn't learn in full until
                    sometime after I left, and only indirectly. These transmissions were picked up
                    in the Soviet Union and the Soviets used them as an example of how the U.S. was
                    subverting the Poles; by transmitting instructions to Solidarity. They of course
                    pressured the Polish Foreign Ministry to lodge an indignant protest to the
                    Embassy. As a result, the Embassy immediately ordered me to cease all
                    transmissions, and told me we could only use the radio to report a life or death
                    emergency threatening our American personnel. That ended my reporting by that
                    means. I then assumed the reason the Embassy complied was because the radio was
                    diplomatically illegal, and did not wish to aggravate relations further.</p>
                <p>The indirect manner in which I found out what had led to the demand from the
                    Foreign Ministry to shut us down was receipt in the mail after I had left the
                    post of a copy of a story from a Leningrad newspaper which charged that the
                    Consulate in Krakow was transmitting orders to Solidarity by clandestine radio.
                    I don't recall exactly who sent me the copy of the story, and hope I thanked him
                    properly. Vaguely I recall it was from someone who knew me or of me, and was
                    stationed in the Middle East at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q Did you have any contact with Solidarnosc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: After the imposition of martial law for a long time none whatsoever,
                    because practically all the Solidarity leaders in this extremely well organized
                    repression had been arrested the night before the announcement of martial law
                    and hauled off to concentration camps throughout Poland. The only contact we had
                    for a while, practically speaking, was indirectly with an interned Solidarity
                    professor through his wife, after they began to allow family to visit internees
                    in the camps. He would secretly pass to her reports written on rolls of
                    cigarette paper about what was going on in the camps, and she would come to the
                    Consulate to deliver them to us. By this time they were allowing Poles to enter.
                    Our political-economic officer, John Ritchie, would decipher then as well as he
                    could and report. One of the reports about the number of Solidarity internees
                    interned and released directly contradicted what the Foreign Ministry had told
                    the Embassy. From the beginning, we, the US, had told the regime no real
                    relations with you until you release the internees and go back to having a
                    dialogue with Solidarity to resolve your problems internally, without outside
                    interference. That was the U.S. position - a very solid position - right from
                    the start to not give any pretext for a Soviet invasion and at the same time
                    preserve as much as the autonomy that was left to Poland.</p>
                <p>I don't remember the exact date, but this was a time when some in the Department
                    who saw that martial law had succeeded, thought it was time to for a few carrots
                    to get back into some sort of relationship with the regime such as it was. This
                    recommendation had already gone, or was about to go, from the Department to the
                    White House. Our report shot this initiative down because it proved the Polish
                    regime was lying to us about the internees.</p>
                <p>Later, Embassy reaction to another of our reports from I believe a different
                    source we in Krakow knew to be very reliable caused a problem for me. We were
                    reporting directly to the Department with a copy to the Embassy as mandated from
                    the time I arrived there. We were also having so-called info copies sent to
                    posts in Europe most involved in East-West relations, particularly our NATO
                    mission. Of course, we never identified the source of a report beyond rating its
                    reliability. Well, the Embassy received a routine request from our NATO Mission
                    asking whether the report could be shared with our allies. Without checking with
                    us in Krakow, the Embassy immediately replied that they did not wish the report
                    to be distributed because they knew the source, and did not consider him
                    reliable, which contradicted our own rating. About a week later when we got a
                    copy of this exchange in the pouch, and I saw how the Embassy had misconstrued
                    the identity of our source and rating, I lodged a protest with the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Intelligence, reporting, was our prime mission, and I had thought long and hard
                    about it during previous experience in INR. Intelligence to be useful must be
                    factual and neutral with respect to policy objectives, because it is supposed to
                    tell us what the real situation is, what the facts are. Only In their light can
                    we see how to advance our policies. So we shouldn't slant intelligence or limit
                    it in order to support policy objectives.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I don't know if I related this last time, but on one of my visits to the Embassy
                    for consultation - this was after the imposition of martial law - I discussed my
                    views on reporting together with the DCM and the Ambassador together; we were
                    walking in the Embassy grounds. I told them Krakow couldn't report everything -
                    there was just too much - so we had to be selective. Aside from the intrinsic
                    importance of an event, I based my selection on what I saw of Embassy reporting.
                    If I saw the Embassy was fully reporting on a subject, I didn't report the same
                    thing - what I call a sort of me-too kind of reporting - but tried to report
                    from what we got from our contacts, and other information what the Embassy
                    wasn't reporting, to fill out the picture. Occasionally, I said, we may report
                    something which contradicts what the Embassy is reporting, or an Embassy's
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>Neither the DCM nor the Ambassador to my recollection commented on what I had
                    said, and I took that for agreement. However, later on I found that they had
                    decided to vet everything from Krakow before sending it on to the Department. I
                    suspected some things were never sent on, and remember seeing a few reports
                    later in the archives which were substantially edited or summarized.</p>
                <p>From about the spring of 1982, after all open resistance had finally ended in
                    Silesia, martial law measures were gradually ended, and most Solidarity
                    activists were released from camps. However, some measures were still in effect
                    when I was transferred out in the summer of '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there were sermons in the church which referred to
                        the situation telling people what to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I know there were in parishes elsewhere in Poland; to my knowledge,
                    there were none in the Church around the corner from the residence which I
                    attended. I had some trouble understanding the sermons that were given anyway,
                    given my limitation in Polish and the acoustics. There was a priest in Warsaw
                    who became rather notorious. He was kidnapped and tied up and thrown into a
                    lake. This was well into the martial law period, and a movie was later made
                    about it.</p>
                <p>To Foreign Ministries in the West, after about six months, all this looked like
                    this had been a brilliant victory by the regime and Jaruzelski's reputation as
                    decisive leader was very much enhanced. There were even some people in the West
                    who openly admired him. I don't know whether I have mentioned this earlier, but
                    right after I came out of Poland in mid-1983, by which time most of the
                    restrictions imposed by martial law had been lifted, Barbara Walters had an
                    exclusive interview with Jaruzelski...</p>

                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, and she is still prominent. I witnessed this on television in a
                    highly emotional stat. I had just come back...I think I was close to a nervous
                    breakdown, because I had just gotten some severe criticism from my supervisor,
                    the DCM Herb Wilgis. An inspection of our Mission in Poland by the Department's
                    had taken place, and what I told the inspectors, and what he told them had
                    apparently clashed. This happened when I was on the way out and my replacement,
                    Mike Metrinko, who had been a hostage in Teheran, was on the way in. We were
                    both guests at a dinner given by the DCM at his residence in Warsaw. I no sooner
                    arrived than Herb confronted me in front of everyone, demanding to know what I
                    had told the inspectors, I assume with hindsight about my protest to the Embassy
                    on how they had handled two of our reports. I was shocked, and don't recall
                    saying anything. I think Mrs. Wilgis intervened and the subject was dropped.</p>
                <p>Anyway, getting back to the Barbara Walters interview with Jaruzelski, I watched
                    it in my room in the hotel on the corner of Virginia and 22nd Street which is
                    now a dormitory of George Washington University. I vividly remember it; there
                    sat Jaruzelski with his dark glasses in a throne like chair he had some sort of
                    eye problem - and she was sitting much lower, looking up at him with admiring
                    eyes. And she said, “Now tell me, General, how did it feel for you as a Polish
                    nationalist to impose martial law on your own people in order to prevent a
                    Soviet invasion?” I was so close to kicking in that television set that I had to
                    restrain myself, because the exact opposite was true. He was finally carrying
                    out his orders from the Soviets; to roll back Solidarity for which they had
                    given him all kinds of support.</p>
                <p>I have just reviewed on the internet what the National Security Archives had put
                    up on their web site on this subject. They published a book of translated
                    documents, From Solidarity to Martial Law, obtained from the State Department
                    archives, the Polish government, the Polish Workers Party, the Kremlin and
                    others about the imposition of martial law in Poland. I have just ordered a
                    copy. One document was the notes of a Russian officer who attended a meeting
                    between Kulikov, the Russian General who headed the Warsaw Pact at the time, and
                    Jaruzelski a few days before the imposition of martial law, in which Jaruzelski
                    emotionally expressed his distress at having been told that the Soviets did not
                    intend to introduce troops into Poland when martial law was declared.</p>
                <p>Far from imposing martial law in order to forestall a Russian invasion, he was
                    carrying out the solution which most met Soviet interests in the bloc and
                    internationally with the West. He was distressed that Kulikov no longer intended
                    introduce additional Soviet troops into Poland simultaneously to back him up.
                    These notes were shown to historians and principals of the events at a meeting
                    in Poland organized by the National Security Archives and others in 1997. Both
                    Jaruzelski and Kulikov were present at this meeting.</p>
                <p>Jaruzelski had no ideological reservations about socialism under Soviet
                    leadership, and, unlike Ceausescu, saw no reason to defend Poland's autonomy
                    within the bloc.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Also, unlike his predecessor as First Secretary, Wladiswlaw Gomulka, who in 1956
                    had been made Party First Secretary in the wake of the Poznan uprising,
                    Jaruzelski not only was not opposed to the introduction of Soviet troops, but
                    was counting on them to back him up when he imposed martial law. Khrushchev was
                    quite prepared to send troops into Poland in 1956 as he did later that year in
                    Hungary. Gomulka, stood up to Khrushchev on the issue of troops; but we can
                    imagine him having made the same promises to roll back the concessions which had
                    been made to the workers to end their opposition, as did Kania and Jaruzelski in
                    December 1980. He did in fact gradually roll them back over the next few
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During all this period I imagine one of the things we had
                        been watching very closely in the aftermath of World War II was Polish
                        anti-Semitism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was there, but the Nazis having eliminated almost the entire Jewish
                    population, was not evident. The influence of what was left of the Jewish
                    community was nil, so it did not even come up as an issue in society. Both
                    before and after martial law, the Consulate in Krakow was intermittently
                    pressured by Rabbi Leaders of the Jewish community in the United States to
                    intervene with the Polish authorities for the restoration of Jewish cemeteries
                    and monuments which had been vandalized or obliterated during the Nazi period. I
                    hosted several such visits, and we found that the Polish authorities were
                    reasonably cooperative in dealing with these requests.</p>
                <p>Regarding the Jewish community in Krakow, I recall one experience that concerned
                    Pope John Paul II, who as a youth in Krakow had close Jewish friends. Some
                    Jewish extremists have questioned what he did or didn't do to help them when
                    they were being rounded up by the Nazis. He was at the time an unskilled laborer
                    and secretly studying for the priesthood. The vestigial Jewish community in
                    Krakow - I don't recall any numbers, but it was only a few thousand - was
                    divided between strictly orthodox and liberal members. The latter were the
                    majority which had a sort of cooperative relationship with the regime which
                    allowed them to receive welfare assistance from international Jewish
                    organizations. Well, about this time, a New York congressman who is very
                    militant in defense of Jews everywhere...I can't recall his name; he was an
                    extremely demanding guy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Stephen Solarz?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Of course! And I'm sure you know his personality. Well, he announced a
                    visit to Poland, and in his request to the Department practically demanded
                    appointments with Polish leaders from the top down. I don't now recall whether
                    this was before or after the imposition of martial law; I think after. In any
                    event, the Poles were largely responsive, because they were anxious to maintain
                    or restore economic relations, especially with the U.S. In Krakow, I hosted him
                    to a luncheon with just four of us at the residence: the leader of the Jewish
                    conservative group, the leader of the liberal group, Solarz and myself.</p>
                <p>Solarz at one point in his very aggressive way asked: “And he Pope, the Pope, was
                    he anti-Semitic? The orthodox leader answered immediately with emotion: “The
                    Pope is not anti-Semitic at all; he is pro-Semitic. He said that so strongly;
                    the orthodox man defended him to the hilt. I don't recall the liberal leader
                    saying anything at all; he just kept his mouth shut.</p>
                <p>One more experience regarding the Pope - John Paul II - comes strongly to mind in
                    this context. Of course he was enormously popular with the people, and credited
                    by many analysts with a major role in the collapse of communism. I'm reminded of
                    here. Toward the end of my tour with martial law still in effect, he made his
                    second to Poland. The regime had hoped to use the visit - which it felt it could
                    not refuse - to help legitimize itself with the people. But, as on his first
                    visit in June 1979 shortly before my arrival, this second visit attracted
                    enormous crowds; and here and there within them, Solidarity banners were
                    prominently displayed. This was especially true in the last city he visited,
                    Krakow where an estimated two million filled the vast open park-like area called
                    the blonie to attend the Solemn Mass and listen to the Pope's words of
                    encouragement. For me, on the platform with my wife near the altar, it was a
                    truly moving experience. Here too, Solidarity banners were prominently
                    displayed, making clear to the world that Solidarity still lived.</p>
                <p>Presumably, to deter crowds from being present at the Pope's departure, the
                    regime had his plane leave from a more distant military airport to which access
                    was restricted. Told at first that consular representatives were not invited, I
                    insisted, and, to my pleasant surprise was permitted to join the end of the
                    motorcade, just behind a couple of police vehicles. It was about the only time
                    in my four years in Krakow that I had the chauffeur put the flags on the
                    fenders. At points along the route, people had gathered. Invariably they booed
                    the police vehicles ahead of me, but then quickly burst into cheers as my car
                    went by. Despite being denigrated in the rigidly controlled media for so long as
                    having subverted the people, I was pleased to note that official Americans were
                    still popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you had been criticized by the DCM at
                        the time you left; how did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, that was the end of it. I went home and, though we never saw each
                    other again, we resumed our personal relations by mail for a time which had been
                    good during my tour. I recall paying off a sports bet I lost by sending him a
                    box of Turin's famous chocolates, gianduiotti. He had once told me that I had
                    the best job in Poland, and I had no disagreement with that whatsoever. In fact,
                    when he went on to another assignment not long after I left, he became our
                    Consul General in Barcelona. I never tried to review the matter of the criticism
                    with him or anyone else as perhaps I should have. After home leave, I went on to
                    Torino, to reopen the Consulate there.</p>
                <p>Before we move on, I would like to address some myths about what took place in
                    Poland while I was there, which have pretty much become the conventional wisdom.
                    One is that Jaruzelski pulled off a military coup which is totally false.</p>
                <p>Yes, he was Minister of Defense and Commander in Chief; and yes, he organized
                    this Council of Military Generals which allegedly ran the country. But he was
                    also the First Secretary of the Party and the leader of the moderate core of the
                    Party's Politburo. It was the collective decision of this political group to
                    impose martial law to crush Solidarity and restore the Party's monopoly of power
                    as the Soviets had pressured them to do throughout 1981. The military takeover
                    was formal window dressing, because they well knew how much the Party and
                    government were discredited, and the Security police of the Ministry of
                    Interior, who actually carried out the repression, were hated. The military
                    uniform on the other hand retained some respect among the people. The military
                    was used - I like to say “prostituted” - in the imposition of martial law. Even
                    the anchors on evening news program were dressed in the uniform, which gave rise
                    to this joke: “What is the lowest rank in the Polish Army?” The answer: “News
                    announcer on TV.” Many Poles actually took walks during the program as a protest
                    of its propaganda.</p>
                <p>Despite several requests for an appointment, I was never received by the General
                    appointed to run the Krakow province. He never appeared publicly, and, to my
                    knowledge, never gave an order.</p>
                <p>However, I did get to meet the Air Force General who allegedly ran the important
                    province of Katowice. He received me jointly with the First Secretary of the
                    Party there, who like everywhere else also was also the Prefect or woyewoda,
                    before and under martial law. The conversation with the General was very
                    pleasant; he proudly named the many different aircraft he had flown in his
                    career, and we shared a common interest in flying and aviation. I enjoy the
                    memory. The conversation with the First Secretary on the other hand was an
                    adversarial exchange over martial law, Solidarity, and the allegations of U.S.
                    subversion of the latter. It was easy to see that he was the hardliner in
                    charge.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Martial law was actually carried out by the Security Police of the Ministry of
                    the Interior, the so-called Zomos who I liked to call the attack dogs of the
                    regime. Their forces were large, and they were mechanized as well. The people
                    well knew the difference between them and the regular militia who arrested
                    thieves and directed traffic. I can remember a Party conference in Krakow during
                    martial law at which the head of the police was quoted in Gazeta Krakowska as
                    boasting that the prime mission of the police was to protect the Party.
                    Protection of the people from criminals was obviously secondary.</p>
                <p>This reminds me of what a courageous Solidarity supporter, Barbara, whom my wife
                    and I had come to know well, had her children say when the police visited their
                    school to explain their role. She primed them to ask: “Are you the police who
                    protect us, or are you the police who beat people?” Barbara and her husband -
                    both engineers - later defected and reside with their children in Chicago.
                    Dorothy and I wrote testimonials in their behalf to the Immigration Service
                    while they were in a refugee camp in Germany. I've recently received a tourist
                    card of the Arizona Memorial in Honolulu where they vacationed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you left, I take it was stressful for you and your
                        family toward the end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was indeed, but more so for some of the other officers and Polish
                    employees. I see it as an obligation to memorialize the loyalty and courage
                    shown by most of the Consulate's local Polish staff under martial law. They too,
                    for whom we Americans could provide no protection, were harassed by the security
                    police. One, especially, the late Andzej Glowacz, I learned was brutally beaten
                    with his wife after I left. I have already mentioned that John Ritchie, the
                    political reporting officer, was hit by water cannon in the Main Square. On that
                    occasion he, along with demonstrators was knocked down several times and had to
                    take refuge in a bookstore which had its windows smashed. The aim, obviously,
                    was to beat demonstrators including women children - not just break up
                    demonstrations. On another occasion, he along with John Schmidt, then Visa
                    Officer, were dragged into an unmarked car and only escaped being beaten with
                    rubber truncheons after their diplomatic status was verified. I came under
                    attack only once; when zomos dressed like workers attempted to break the rear
                    view window of my official car by beating on it with rubber truncheons. They
                    didn't succeed. I had driven with the chauffeur to the steel mill in Nowa Huta
                    after demonstrations to see what I could see. We made a wrong turn and came upon
                    a square where the buses of the zomos were parked.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>As for my family, we had an experience which was not all that stressful, but
                    certainly memorable. At the beginning of martial law when my number two
                    daughter, Teresa, was scheduled to make a visit from Washington University in
                    St. Louis? Under the educational benefits the Department provides, she received
                    round trip transportation for two visits during the academic year. She was all
                    set to come for the holidays. When martial law was imposed, her trip was
                    cancelled. Well, prior to that she had invited five or six university friends
                    who were on short-term university exchange visits in Europe to come visit her in
                    Krakow over the holidays. In anticipation of their arrival, my wife and I had
                    made a special trip to the Commissary at a U.S. base in West Berlin to stock up
                    on food. I joked that we had enough supplies to feed the Soviet army if it
                    invaded.</p>
                <p>My daughter's trip was cancelled; but, would you believe it, five or six of these
                    guys and gals showed up. Train travel to and from Poland in the period was
                    disrupted and unpredictable. For over a week, while I had the Consulate
                    administrative people trying to arrange return travel for them to Western
                    Europe, we had twelve people residing in the residence and around the table
                    every day. Those pantry supplies disappeared so fast. My two resident daughters,
                    Linda, number four, then 12, and Patti, number five and 5, had the most
                    enjoyable time with all these students who played games with them and otherwise
                    entertained them.</p>
                <p>When we finally got them tickets on the Warsaw train to Vienna which stopped at
                    Katowice, about an hour's drive west from Krakow, I personally drove them to the
                    station in the Consulate's suburban vehicle to make sure they got on it. The
                    station was chaotic and the train was bulging with passengers with some people
                    on the roof. The students managed to get on it, through a window, with me
                    pushing.</p>
                <p>Another development regarding Teresa who had invited these students and never
                    showed up was her engagement to be married. We received the news in a State
                    Department cable. When her trip was cancelled, a friend, John Petros, who was
                    courting her, invited her to spend the holidays with his parents in suburban
                    Chicago. While she was there, he popped the question, she accepted, and the
                    Department passed the news in an official cable. They are now long since
                    married, both medical doctors, and have five daughters as my wife and I.</p>
                <p>Back to the myths; I could go on illustrating how the military wasn't the
                    institution which actually imposed martial law or ran the country under it, but
                    another myth which has become part of the conventional wisdom was that
                    Solidarity with its strikes was to blame for the economic chaos which prompted -
                    even justified - the imposition of martial law, as Jaruzelski claimed in his
                    address to the nation.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Yes, a Solidarity leader in Krakow once told me that we could work harder, but
                    not when we see so much waste and corruption in the factories. I may have
                    already mentioned my visit to a machine tool factory in Tarnow or Zszezow, east
                    of Krakow, in the fall of 1981. Solidarity had replaced the regime labor union
                    in the factory early on, and, in effect ran it, while observing a correct
                    relationship with the management appointed by the authorities. Its machine tools
                    were exported to the West. Despite more difficulty than in preceding years in
                    obtaining the necessary raw materials, it had increased production and earned
                    more hard currency for Poland in 1981 than in preceding years.</p>
                <p>In the conventional wisdom, much is made of the fact that throughout 1981 Kania
                    and Jaruzelski resisted Soviet pressure to have martial law imposed. However, at
                    no time did Jaruzelski disagree with the need to roll back Solidarity and
                    reestablish the Party's monopoly of power. At no time did he contemplate an
                    agreement with Solidarity to resolve economic problems with their cooperation.
                    He remained a believer in Soviet-style socialism as good for the “too romantic”
                    Polish people, as he characterized them to a Western interviewer after martial
                    law's success.</p>
                <p>When he replaced Kania as First Secretary of the Party in October 1981 without
                    giving up any of the other positions he held - Prime Minister, Defense Minister
                    and Commander in Chief — it became clear that the Soviets had restored their
                    faith in him, and relied on him to deliver on the promises made the previous
                    December. After the success of martial law, Jaruzelski also became Head of the
                    Council of State or President of Poland, again without relinquishing any of the
                    previous offices, and was apparently looking forward to being made Marshal
                    before his death, the highest military honor available in East Europe.</p>
                <p>A final point I'd like to make is how surprised and unforeseen the imposition of
                    martial law was to the CIA and State Department. In fact, our Ambassador,
                    Francis Meehan, was here in Washington on consultation when it occurred. He left
                    Poland at a time when the signs of crisis were rapidly multiplying. He was
                    obviously relying on CIA reports which attributed little possibility to the
                    imposition of martial law by the regime; reasons for which I have mentioned
                    earlier. I would add that they had apparently interpreted Kania and Jaruzelski's
                    resistance to the timing, the Soviets and their hardliner allies in the Polish
                    Party wanted for its imposition as rejection of it as a solution. The
                    documentary revelations I mentioned earlier show that they - and the Soviets -
                    may have been right about Kania, but certainly not about Jaruzelski.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>This was a great failure of intelligence, as Douglas MacEachin, a former
                    intelligence analyst and director in the CIA explains in his book, US
                    Intelligence and the Polish Crisis, published in 2000. It is really difficult to
                    understand this failure because we had the best spy you could possibly imagine
                    within Jaruzelski's inner circle, Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski. In fact, part of
                    his responsibility was to help plan martial law. He gave all of this
                    information, almost on a real time basis, to the CIA. When he was threatened
                    with exposure in a general investigation for sources of leaks, the CIA in a
                    truly brilliant operation, managed to spirit him and his entire family out of
                    Poland. The details of the operation read more like a spy novel than facts they
                    were. All of this is explained in a book and articles about him.</p>
                <p>So we had the final plans and the source with his family in Washington, yet we
                    did nothing with them. We could have blown this thing, but didn't. This remains
                    for me a mystery to be resolved. It remains even a mystery to MacEachin as he
                    explains in the closing chapter of his book. I hope to go into it later on, if
                    and when I write the book it's been my intention to write since I left
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>Since 2008 Jaruzelski has been on trial in Poland. His defense of course is that
                    he imposed martial law to save his people from a worse evil, a Soviet invasion.
                    As I explained in a previous session, Jaruzelski was in a position to reach an
                    agreement with Solidarity in which the Party gave up its monopoly of power, and
                    bring about a transition to a limited, but genuine, form of democracy while
                    deterring the Soviets coming in to crush it. I'm convinced of that thesis, but
                    you can never rerun history to prove it. So it will remain debatable, perhaps
                    forever. Recent documentary evidence however, neither supports Jaruzelski's
                    defense, nor the thesis that the Soviets would have invaded had he refused to
                    impose their solution; indeed, to the contrary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Poland, when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I left in August of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea of where you wanted to go; what you
                        wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, I felt - and this may have been arrogance on my part - but I
                    thought I was ready for a good DCM job. I had long ago set the objective of
                    becoming an ambassador, and I thought I was ready for the normal step to an
                    ambassadorship by serving as a deputy chief of mission. At this time the job in
                    Prague was open, and I volunteered for it. I wrote the Ambassador, but he had
                    already picked his man. However, as I was about to leave on a trip it took six
                    months to set up to visit Moscow and Leningrad to celebrate our 25th wedding
                    anniversary - I had never been to the Soviet Union - I received a phone call
                    from Personnel in the Department, offering me the job of Political Counselor in
                    Prague, which from a career standpoint I should have taken.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I had also received an offer directly from the DCM in Rome, Peter Bridges, to go
                    to Torino and reopen the Consulate there which had been closed in 1980 over the
                    vigorous protests of the entire Torinese power elite, from Agnelli on down. They
                    hadn't persuaded the Department, but belatedly convinced the Congress which by a
                    line item appropriation mandated the reopening of Turin and four other posts in
                    Western Europe.</p>
                <p>The Department in the late 70's and early 80's was really bent on closing posts,
                    and there seem to be an unholy alliance between the Office of Management and
                    Budget in the White House and the Department's Bureau of Administration.
                    Congress therefore forced the Department to reopen these posts. I accepted this
                    offer seeing it as an opportunity to establish a small post as it should be
                    established.</p>
                <p>Part of my rationalization for making this choice was to get my family out of
                    that polluted environment. We had spent four years in Krakow which had one of
                    the most polluted environments in the world, and what I had seen of Prague's on
                    the two or three drives we took through it on our way to and from Vienna seemed
                    just as bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carl, so now you're in Torino. You were there from '83
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Eighty-seven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-seven. In the first place, overall, how did the
                        one-officer post work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I can best characterize my activity at this one-officer post as doing a
                    little bit of everything a post normally does, and not enough of anything.
                    Because it was a one-officer post I was the only one who could do anything
                    classified above Limited Official Use - not really a classification - and had to
                    rely very much on my number one Foreign Service National secretary for just
                    about everything else. She was not just a secretary, but an executive assistant,
                    often acting even as my deputy in dealing with the police and some other local
                    authorities. At a one-officer post you're really on call 7/24, particularly for
                    emergency protection and welfare cases, the one consular function you cannot
                    avoid. You are a permanent duty officer.</p>
                <p>When I went away to a conference or a vacation, the first call every morning from
                    my hotel was to the office and Carla Maria Fumai - that was her name. She would
                    tell me what happened the day before, what requests had been made, and get my
                    decisions on all items that couldn't wait. And I would sometimes call again in
                    the evening, or be called, when there was a particularly urgent item, to make
                    sure that it had gone well.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>In my last year at Krakow as Principal Officer a Foreign Service inspector had
                    come to Warsaw and told us that there would no longer be one-officer posts. At
                    such posts, the officer is burdened by innumerable administrative reports that
                    he must make, the classified pouch, and security functions which cannot be
                    delegated to local employees. They figured that he spends over 50 percent of his
                    time on nothing but these purely administrative tasks. Whatever happened to that
                    decision I don't know, because when the State Department was forced by Congress
                    to reopen five posts in 1983, including Torino, which they had closed in 1980,
                    they limited the staffing to one officer and two FSNs at all of them.</p>
                <p>The Department had long been trying to close small posts purely for budgetary
                    reasons. They finally had success in the late 70's and early '80s, I think
                    because of the great additional security costs to protect against terrorism,
                    which had become a major concern.</p>
                <p>So, I was busy all the time, at this one officer post. But I kind of welcomed the
                    challenge of trying to get as much done as possible with practically no staff. I
                    even put the uniformed security guard to work. He sat at a desk facing the metal
                    entry door, and admitted and logged visitors. Though a consulate, the Department
                    did not require us to issue visas. We arranged for a contract courier service to
                    run sealed bags containing applications in sealed envelopes for visas to the
                    Consulate General in Genoa, and bring back the processed cases the same way.</p>
                <p>The system worked extremely well; but at one point we had to put out a notice
                    that we were not charging the applicants a cent for this service. Some local
                    travel agencies were charging clients for whom they handled the paperwork rather
                    exorbitant fees, and alleging or giving them the perception that we were
                    charging these fees. That was the only glitch that we had to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about protection and welfare? What kind did you
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Emergencies were about the only ones we ever dealt with. The ones that
                    were not true emergencies we referred to Genoa. One particular case stands out
                    in my mind. A young man with a knapsack and tattered clothing, unshaven and
                    obviously exhausted showed up one day. He was so badly off that I had him take a
                    shower in the private bathroom off my office. I think it was about the only time
                    the shower in it was ever used. I sent one of the FSNs out to buy clothing for
                    him. We processed an emergency loan from the Department, and got in touch with
                    his parents in New York. The father was a prominent executive of an aerospace
                    company, a manufacturer of helicopters. The parents had been absolutely
                    desperate about the welfare of their son who had set out months earlier to
                    travel the world.</p>
                <p>They of course immediately came up with all the additional money needed for his
                    travel home. The most rewarding thing about Protection and Welfare work is the
                    feeling that you've helped somebody, and the appreciation the families often
                    show in cases like this</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I recall another interesting case which also illustrates how efficient my Carla
                    Maria was. While shaving on a Saturday evening to go to a dinner she relayed
                    this frantic phone call from a little town in the mountains, pleading for
                    assistance. A young man, a naturalized American citizen, who had come back to
                    visit his mother, had just been thrown into jail because he hadn't done his
                    military service before he left years earlier. All I needed to do was over to
                    Carla Maria and authorize her to call the police on my behalf. In no time at all
                    on a Saturday night she got in touch with the our friendly official with
                    responsibility for foreigners in the Questura, the regional Police Department,
                    who had this guy returned to his family that same evening, and the issue of his
                    draft violation deferred until the following Monday. I don't recall ever
                    learning what happened, since by Monday it was no longer an emergency, and we
                    referred the case to our Consulate in Genoa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the trade unions there, Torino
                        being a big manufacturing area? Well, in the first place, was it CSIL or UIL
                        or was it...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The main one was CGIL, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, it
                    was the largest and tied to the Communist Party. They were dominant among
                    industrial workers in the north. They put on these tremendous, endless marches
                    every May Day in Milan waving red banners. These workers were the loyal members
                    of the Communist party, its base. I went to witness it once and was awed. CISL
                    was a Christian Democratic Party federation of unions, and UIL was a smaller one
                    tied to the Socialist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the labor leaders
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: No, I did not, and I'm a little surprised that I didn't. When I was
                    there from '83 to '87 there was not a lot of labor unrest. However, I do recall
                    hearing constantly about what happened in 1980, the year the Department
                    coincidentally had closed the Consulate. During a strike which had FIAT on the
                    ropes, there was a march of about 40,000 technicians, employees of FIAT, against
                    the strike. It effectively brought an end to the strike, and FIAT survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that very well. I mean, when you have union
                        workers protesting basically on the side of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: ...Of the owners.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: And it was a watershed event. One of my first cousins I recently
                    visited in Torino, a retired FIAT technician, participated in the march. In 1980
                    FIAT's automobile division, its largest, was just about ready to collapse. They
                    had suffered major vandalism within the plants, vandalism perpetrated by
                    extremists to the left of the Communists themselves, but the union leaders did
                    nothing to stop it. It was a time when it was politically impossible for the
                    Communists to admit that any extremist violence came from the left, even though
                    it was a threat to their national policy to enter the government coalition.</p>
                <p>1980 was also the year when Fiat retrenched. They quit making certain models and
                    brought in new managers and really resurrected themselves. But more recently -
                    this is a sidebar - in the early 2000s they were on the ropes again, and seem to
                    have survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Fiat management, the Agnellis and all that? You
                        know, they were the big lobbyists to keep the post open in 1980. Did they
                        pay much attention to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. I had good relations with both the Agnelli brothers who ran the
                    company at the time, Gianni and Umberto, but particularly with Umberto. Gianni
                    was already in semi-retirement in his home on the collina, as the hill
                    overlooking Turin was called - my residence was on the same hill with a
                    magnificent view of the Alps. I only had contact with him directly when the
                    Ambassador visited, I guess twice during my tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Raab. R-A-A-B. I just can't drudge up his first name but he was a
                    prominent Republican politician from New York, and was quite diligent in
                    carrying out his ambassadorial duties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had actually served as an official in Eisenhower's
                        administration, I think, like a sub chief of staff or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, I guess he had clout within the party. But I thought he was an
                    effective Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maxwell Raab.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: That's it. You have an excellent memory, I see. And we had excellent
                    relations. When the Consulate reopened under Congressional mandate, he came up
                    for the official reopening. At the ceremony, both he and I tried to counter
                    skepticism as to whether we would maintain it, given its small size in an office
                    suite, and the fact that we had closed a larger one in 1980 despite their pleas
                    to keep it there. In my remarks I said the U.S. makes mistakes, but unlike other
                    countries, has the rare virtue of recognizing them. Therefore, in deference to
                    the importance of Torino, we were reopening. Beginnings are usually small, but
                    we're going to expand. The Ambassador emphasized that point too. That's what
                    made the bitternesd - and I use the word literally here - my own personal
                    bitterness over the decision to close the Consulate again in 1987 is so
                    strong.</p>
                <p>Anyway, at the time, I saw the assignment as a challenge to develop the Consulate
                    as one should be developed, to create a new concept of a small consulate.
                    Closures of consulates elsewhere in Europe, including Italy, after our reopening
                    continued. To the extent I could, I urged the Embassy to oppose any more
                    closures in Italy, and as a contribution to the cause submitted an article to
                    the Foreign Service Journal entitled, “Consulates: To Be or Not to Be,” arguing
                    that the Foreign Service cannot carry out its legislative mandate without posts
                    in major cities of democracies, where local leaders have such an enormous
                    influence on the policies of the national Government. Another point I made,
                    among others, was that consulates deal directly with the public - the people -
                    while embassies deal primarily with government bureaucracies. So in pluralistic
                    democracies, it is absolutely essential to have consulates in major urban
                    centers to carry out our mandate.</p>
                <p>I guess that partly explains why I was hyper-active. No federal agency could come
                    to me without me giving a lot of attention to its request. I did a lot of
                    commercial work though it was not in my mandate; and I gave very high priority
                    to cultural work though it wasn't either. Consulate General Milan was supposed
                    to cover commercial work in my District; but I never saw them except when I went
                    myself there to pick up pouches. The USIS officer in Genoa was responsible for
                    cultural in my District, but his or her attempt to do so was limited to two or
                    three evening visits a month to use my office to interview candidates for
                    grants. They did have an excellent USIS FSN who spent more time in Turin.
                    Because I was there and his American supervisor was in Genoa, I found it
                    necessary to get involved in his support on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>I consider my greatest single achievement in Turin a self-initiated project which
                    combined both commercial and cultural promotion. At lunch one day at the
                    Vittoria family restaurant, the young proprietor hesitantly asked me whether it
                    was really true that the U.S. had landed men on the moon. With some
                    embarrassment, he said his communist friends had assured him that it had all
                    been a publicity hoax. I was amazed - and he was relieved - because he was
                    himself pro-American.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>At this time, the director of Turin's prestigious International Auto Show - also
                    very pro-American - was imploring me to persuade Washington to participate in
                    some fashion in the Show's next occurrence later that year. As I recall, he
                    offered centrally located space gratis. So I put it to USIS to mount a U.S. man
                    on the moon exhibit. While sympathetic, USIS replied that the request was too
                    late and there was no budget for it. I then persuaded four U.S. companies in the
                    space industry each to contribute $2,500 to the project. In the end, USIA in
                    Washington supplied large translucent photos, those films we have all seen on
                    television of U.S. astronauts gallivanting on the moon, and even a moon rock
                    exhibit which had to be guarded while on display, and secured in a safe
                    overnight. Commerce's staff in Milan mounted the exhibit for us. Shortly after
                    the President of Italy, Sandro Pertini, cut the ribbon opening the Show, he was
                    escorted by the Director and our own DCM up from Rome to tour our exhibit. Many
                    thousands visited it.</p>
                <p>I spoke to groups, mostly to Lion and Rotary clubs. Once I even spoke once to the
                    Monarchist National Party in Milan on the Constitutional Powers of the U.S.
                    Presidency, because USIS Milan couldn't find anyone else in answer to their
                    request. I did my research for it with books from their library. Ironically,
                    USIS finally decided to assign their Genoa FSN permanently to the Consulate, at
                    about the same time the Department decided to close it again.</p>
                <p>The Consulate also provided support to NASA. They had a man there full time with
                    his dependent wife to work on a tethered satellite launch project with the
                    Italian Space agency which was located in Turin. NASA provided funds to the
                    Department for the administrative support we gave him, under an inter-agency
                    agreement. With their funds we even bought a fax machine for his use and
                    ours.</p>
                <p>Political and economic reporting, and cultivating relations with the local
                    political and economic power elites, were my primary mandate. FIAT was my major
                    reporting subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As for Fiat, how much was it about an economically viable
                        entity, and how much of it an almost political entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, it was political-economic. FIAT also to some extent created
                    commercial and consular work for us, because we had a number of American
                    businessmen residing in Torino with their families for work with various
                    branches of FIAT or other local companies. So we had a little private
                    international school to support under the Department's program for such schools.
                    I managed to get donations from the Agnelli family for this school because
                    Umberto Agnelli had two of his children enrolled in it. Quite a few Italians
                    sent their children to this school so that they would learn English early on.
                    They saw speaking English as a big asset for their children's future.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>In fact, because there were so many Italians in the school, the playground
                    language was Italian. I saw this as an advantage for the American children to
                    pick up Italian from the Italian friends they made. I had one daughter, my fifth
                    and last, Patricia, in that school. She had previously learned Polish extremely
                    well in pre-school and kindergarten in Poland. In Torino we put her in this
                    school and she was mum for about four or five months on Polish or Italian. But
                    then, all of a sudden she started speaking Italian fluently, having picked it up
                    from close friends that she made at the school. You know what happens with
                    children, the parents of friends of your children invite them to birthday
                    parties, or just to play together, and you reciprocate. Our best friends at all
                    our posts were parents of friends of our children. So Patty learned Italian
                    almost as fast as she had learned Polish.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the school was also one of the means by which I came into contact with
                    influential people, particularly Umberto Agnelli. But I guess your original
                    question on FIAT was...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, my experience was in the South and there they had a
                        suit against Alfa Romeo. The issue was almost more political than economic.
                        Alfa Romeo was there because it provided employment, and that seemed to be
                        its major purpose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: And it was huge financial drain on the Government; so much so that in
                    my time Alfa Romeo came up for sale and Ford very aggressively went after it
                    with the full support of the Embassy. I mean, the Ambassador himself became a
                    commercial officer, so to speak, to promote this sale. At the same time Fiat saw
                    Ford taking over Alfa Romeo as a great threat to them because, in my time, Fiat
                    still had about 60-70 percent of Italy's auto market. It was almost a monopoly.
                    I learned through my contacts that Fiat was fighting any decision by the
                    Government to sell to Ford. I became convinced that no way would Ford win
                    because Fiat and Agnelli were just too influential. I remember writing a report
                    or two expressing this view and that's exactly what happened. In the end Fiat
                    took over Alfa Romeo and, as far as I know, they still own it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the time when I think the SS-20
                        situation had arisen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It had indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets had introduced the SS-20 that was aimed at
                        Europe. The idea was to scare the Europeans into giving less support to the
                        U.S; we responded with a medium range missile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The Pershing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pershing missile and the cruise missile. And there was
                        a lot of pressure put on members of NATO to accept these shorter range
                        missiles, and Italy turned out to be cooperative. So often this was the
                        case, Italy very strong in helping us. How did this play? This was really
                        the final, you might say propaganda or popular battle of the Cold War in
                        Europe. How did this play in Torino?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It was a major topic of concern and conversation. And I tried to carry
                    out the mandate we all had to present our side on this issue to our contacts.
                    The approach I used was to point out that, we hadn't had a nuclear or major war
                    in Europe thanks to the deterrence of our nuclear umbrella. The fundamental
                    principle for deterrence to work is to have credible power for response that is
                    equal or greater than the power of the other side. I was convinced - and could
                    say with all sincerity - we were not about to use our nuclear power to attack or
                    intimidate the Soviet Union, but only maintained it as a deterrent to prevent
                    the Soviet Union from doing that against us or any NATO country. Deterrence was
                    our basic policy.</p>
                <p>And then the point I'd make was that the possession of missiles and bombs by both
                    sides was not so much the problem, as an imbalance between the two sides. I
                    remember making this gesture, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're showing a vertical distance between your two
                        hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes, between one side and the other. The Soviets by deploying these
                    SS-20s, which brought all of Western Europe within their range had created an
                    imbalance intended to intimidate West Europeans and increase their influence
                    over the policies of the West Europeans. These missiles did not threaten the
                    U.S. directly, but did threaten our bases in Europe. By doing this, the Soviets
                    increased the threat of nuclear war, because under the NATO treaty, an attack on
                    one member is considered an attack on all members. They were counting on the
                    doubts of many Europeans that we would fulfill our commitment, and instead agree
                    to compromises at the expense of the West Europeans because we ourselves were
                    not directly threatened. So the only way we could bring the situation back into
                    balance was by deploying our own medium range missiles which brought a similar
                    area of the Warsaw Pact under their range. We could of course do this only with
                    the consent of individual NATO countries in which the missiles would be
                    deployed. So, as you mentioned, a great propaganda war was fought over the
                    basing issue in which the Soviets, their sympathizers, and especially pacifists
                    in Western Europe pulled out all the stops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, discuss what was happening there in Italy. In your
                        area, did you find the Communist party, the Communist unions...were they
                        sort of willing supporters of the Soviet side? Were there demonstrations or
                        how did this play?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: I don't recall major demonstrations on this issue inspired by the
                    Communists on deployment of our Pershing and Ground Launched Cruise Missiles in
                    response to the SS-20. Traditionally, the Communists opposed deployment of
                    missiles in Western Europe, but, in the '70s, they were promoting the Historic
                    Compromise, and had explicitly accepted the NATO alliance until both blocs could
                    be eliminated by agreement.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the basing of GLCMs (ground launch cruise missiles) at a huge base in
                    Comiso, Sicily provided much needed employment, and was welcomed by many of the
                    people there. I recall that the basing of Pershing IIs and GLCMs in other NATO
                    countries received much more popular opposition in those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And in Germany...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: ... I think what overt opposition there was in Italy was much more in
                    the South and Rome, than in the North. In fact, I found much understanding for
                    our position in Turin, where the power elite, especially the economic power
                    elite, were even more supportive of U.S. policy and actions than the Government
                    in Rome. When Qadhafi attempted to hit our LORAN installation on the southern
                    coast of Sicily in 1986 with two Scud missile which fell short into the sea,
                    Rome's reaction was less than firm. At a reception some there told me they were
                    embarrassed by it and apologized as Italians for their Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about terrorism? Where was this coming from? Had this
                        moved over to being Palestinian or Middle Eastern terrorism, or was it still
                        pretty much homegrown terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: I think it was primarily still homegrown terrorism during my time in
                    Torino - the mid-80s - and still directed primarily against individual
                    politicians and business leaders. The most prominent and still the most
                    successful in their terroristic activity were the Red Brigades. They had
                    kidnapped and killed Moro, the leader of the Christian Democrats who was about
                    to consummate the Compromesso Storico as I described earlier. This has led to
                    wild charges, still current today, that we, i.e., the CIA, were really behind
                    it. What I may not have mentioned is that they later kidnapped a U.S. NATO
                    general, General Dozier, in December 1981 while I was coping with the first days
                    of martial law in Krakow. The Italian police rescued him in a brilliant
                    operation in Padua in which one of my cousins took part. He was then a detective
                    there.</p>
                <p>But at the same time we were very conscious of Middle Eastern terrorist threats
                    to ourselves as U.S. diplomats and consuls. In January 1982 there was the
                    assassination in Paris of Charles Ray, one of our military attaches by the
                    Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction. What really got my attention however was
                    the assassination attempt on a colleague, Bob Homme, who had just reopened a
                    Consulate in France under the same Congressional mandate under which I reopened
                    Torino.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strasbourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Yes. Bob in fact works with me now as a WAE declassifying documents
                    requested under FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act. Fortunately for Bob, the
                    single terrorist of Middle East origin was a lousy shot. Only one of five shots
                    he fired at Bob while he was leaving for work from his driveway grazed him in
                    the neck. I don't know whether they ever caught the would be assassin. I would
                    have to ask Bob about that.</p>
                <p>Until then I hadn't considered myself all that threatened, because I saw the
                    terrorists as a sort of megalomaniacs, targeting ambassadors and higher profile
                    diplomats. I then saw myself more open to threat, because Turin is on the road
                    between Paris and Rome which I assumed they traveled. Given the location of the
                    Consulate in the city, I was in a very vulnerable position.</p>
                <p>When the officers from Consulate General Genoa prior to my arrival had picked out
                    the office suite for the Consulate they chose a spacious, plush, newly renovated
                    suite, ideal for our work; but, from a security standpoint, very much exposed.
                    We were on the third floor of a four-sided building with an inner courtyard.
                    There was only one entry to the courtyard in which we parked, through an archway
                    from a busy narrow one-way street. Entry from the courtyard was through an open
                    archway to a glassed in elevator around which wound the stairway. I seldom used
                    the elevator, because I saw how easy it would be for an assassin to conceal
                    himself on the dark stairway, and let me have it through the glass. I usually
                    took the stairs two at a time - for the exercise as well.</p>
                <p>Despite the threat, I refused to give up my habit of taking long walks over lunch
                    hour through the city, so the Questura had a detective in mufti follow me with a
                    newspaper folded around his Beretta pistol. I ran him ragged with my pace. The
                    precautions I did take were to vary my times and routes. I wouldn't give up the
                    walks I took in lieu of a regular lunch, because I was on one of my ambitious
                    weight reduction programs at the time.</p>
                <p>Sometime after my arrival, the Embassy had my official full size Ford Granada
                    armored at the factory in Germany: bullet proof glass, armor plate, wheels with
                    a metal rim inside so that you could continue driving even if the tires were
                    shot out, backup battery, etc. All that extra weight took all the pleasure out
                    of driving it; and, as my administrative assistant/driver found out later, made
                    it hard to control at higher speeds. The security people at the Embassy had me
                    take the car there so they could put dark plastic on the inside of the
                    windshield. I ripped it off on the drive back, because it was almost impossible
                    to see through it against the sun. I figured it was much more of a hazard to my
                    driving than a protection against terrorists.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>I only used the administrative assistant as a chauffeur when I was going on
                    official visits where I'd be met at the entrance to the prefecture, for example,
                    by the prefect or his subordinate. Otherwise, to and from my residence on the
                    collina, I always drove it myself, both because the staff was small, and as a
                    security precaution on the theory that would-be assassins wouldn't think the
                    driver up front was actually the Consul.</p>
                <p>Despite the precautions I took, I know I probably survived because that
                    terrorists never targeted me. I never forgot what a security officer had said
                    when he briefed me with other officers just prior to an assignment abroad. “If
                    they target you, he said, they'll probably get you.” And the way you deal with
                    that, I told myself, is to accept the fact that exposure to terrorism had become
                    part of the job. If you want to be perfectly secure abroad, you are not Foreign
                    Service material. The same, of course, can be said in spades about a military
                    career.</p>
                <p>Back to my administrative/chauffeur FSN. Ford knew that their armored cars were
                    hard to control at speed, so they offered a training course of several days at
                    the factory in West Germany for our chauffeurs. I tried to get my driver
                    enrolled, but the Embassy's Administrative Office told me the budget wouldn't
                    allow it. Well, sometime later, James Baker, then Secretary of the Treasury,
                    made a lightning late afternoon/early evening visit to Turin with a small Air
                    Force jet on a confidential round robin trip to talk urgently to his major
                    European counterparts. I don't recall if I ever found out what the urgent issue
                    was; I was excluded from the meeting. Italy's Treasury Minister was from my
                    District and there at the time - it was, if I recall correctly, on a Saturday or
                    Sunday. On very short notice I and Carla Maria arranged police escort from and
                    to the airport with the very cooperative Questura.</p>
                <p>They did it grand style, police cars, motorcycle police, sirens, all the many
                    intersections blocked to other traffic, no stops from start to finish, a mad
                    dash. Well, during the short reception following the secret meeting to which I
                    was not admitted, the head Treasury Agent accompanying the Secretary took me
                    aside and asked me to request the Italians not to race so fast back to the
                    airport as they had done on the way in. Moreover, they needed a ride - maybe to
                    avoid riding with the polics - so I gave up my plan to go to the airport myself,
                    gave them my armored car and driver, and arranged for him to join the
                    procession. Well, the request to drive slower was ignored, my driver lost
                    control of on a turn; and a minor accident ensued in which no one was hurt.</p>
                <p>When the Embassy Administrative Office tried later to fire my driver, I reminded
                    them of their refusal to give him the special training Ford thought was
                    necessary, refused to comply, and then won my appeal to the DCM and Ambassador
                    on the issue. He in fact has long since immigrated to the U.S. and lives in the
                    Boston area where he has a family, and became a private pilot who has flown much
                    more than I have. I only found out these last details recently.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>For my wife and non-official driving, we bought a brand-new FIAT compact sedan,
                    and registered it locally to keep it anonymous. I was glad we had sold our Chevy
                    Malibu station wagon in Krakow instead of bringing it to Italy where it,
                    literally, would have stood out like a white elephant. The FIAT served us well
                    the four years we were there. The only thing my wife didn't like was its color
                    which she, an artist, described as nauseous green, but it was the only color
                    available for immediate delivery when we arrived. Incidentally, we found it was
                    stable in cruise at 100 mph on the French super highway to Paris when we went
                    there for a short vacation without the children. It handled much better at high
                    speed than the classier British rental I drove on the same highway on a
                    post-retirement private business trip to Europe. It also survived a mild
                    collision she had with a slow moving street car when she turned across its
                    tracks, which was easy to do in Turin. No one was hurt but the car; fortunately
                    the street car had good brakes. I won't talk about the left rear door she tore
                    off as she backed out of our garage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until '87. Well, what happened when they
                        closed the post? How did the decision come up, closing the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: The decision for me was a bolt from the blue in January of 1987. As I
                    mentioned earlier I had been following the closure of consulates in Europe very
                    closely, feeling threatened. Every time I went to the Embassy on consultation ,
                    I would bring up the subject, and every time I would be reassured by Ambassador
                    Raab that Turin wasn't threatened. I got nothing but reassurances. Well, in
                    January of 1987, which was my last year there - I served there four years - I
                    get this phone call from the Deputy Chief of Mission telling me that the
                    Secretary had just signed off on the closure of 10 consulates, including most
                    that had been reopened in 1980. And that was it. Well, I was bitter and I was
                    furious. The stated justification was budgetary, given the outlays for security
                    and federal budget cuts mandated under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.</p>
                <p>I no sooner hung up than I called Carla Maria into the office with her pad and
                    dictated a six page cable arguing against the decision. I had it transmitted
                    unclassified through the Dissent Channel, and asked that it be given the widest
                    distribution, even to the White House and Congress, if possible. In it I
                    emphasized Turin's national importance in both Italy's economy and politics,
                    including the fact that many of Ministers of the national government were based
                    in the District. Some I saw at receptions in Turin more often than the
                    Ambassador did in Rome. Three of the First Secretaries of parties in the
                    Government's coalition were also based in Turin's Consular District.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I had been following the continued closure of Consulates
                    in Europe with foreboding, and had in May 1986 submitted an article to the
                    Foreign Service Journal, “Consulates: To Be or Not To Be.” In it I argued that
                    the real reason for the closure of Consulates was not really budgetary
                    constraints, but the low priority given to Consulates in the competition for
                    funding. I pointed out that Department's budget for the following fiscal year
                    was actually 19 percent higher than the previous year's, and that it was also 40
                    or 50 percent higher than the Department's actual expenditures two and three
                    years before. It was rejected for publication by the editors with the incredible
                    comment that there did not seem to be enough interest in the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened? I mean, when did they shut it down
                        and how did it happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: What happened was that I from that day on went on a quixotic crusade to
                    try to get the decision on Turin reversed by the Secretary by refuting the
                    budgetary argument through documentation of all our expenses, and proof that it
                    would actually cost the Department much more to close the post than keep it
                    open, given that it already had the physical resources it needed. Moreover, some
                    of our small cost was offset by payments the Department received from USIA and
                    Commerce for the support we provided them. I also showed how our fixed cost for
                    the rental of post's office suite would be drastically reduced if we accepted
                    the offer of a substantial villa in the city for almost no rent, because the
                    owner - a wealthy widow - merely wanted it occupied and maintained. Its high
                    fenced garden and gate would also have been a security asset. The reply to this
                    was a reprimand from someone in the Administrative Bureau for opposing the
                    decision to close.</p>
                <p>I did all this well aware of the wisdom of that saying, “You can't fight city
                    hall,” and really didn't expect to win. But I couldn't help myself; so great was
                    my realization of how stupid the decision was, and my personal feeling of
                    betrayal at how it had been taken. As I later learned, the Department had
                    earlier decided to close down the Consulate General in Genoa. The Embassy and
                    Genoa had then persuaded it to allow Genoa to remain open until 1992, the 500th
                    anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus. Closing Turin
                    was offered as a tradeoff in return. This was done without any notice to me
                    whatsoever. That as I argued in the Dissent was contrary to the Foreign Service
                    Manual's requirement that one in my position be consulted when such decisions
                    are made.</p>
                <p>I even submitted a draft Decision Memo with all the protocol formatting, for
                    submission to the Secretary to reverse the decision. I never got a response to
                    that or most of all the other documentation I submitted. It was simply ignored
                    by both the Department and the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Carl, let's move on. So when did you have to shut
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I actually didn't shut the post myself; that was done immediately
                    after my departure by our people from Genoa. I kept waiting for a direct order
                    to do so, which, of course, I would have obeyed. But it never came. They spared
                    me that. As July approached, the Embassy even offered me supplemental
                    representational funds for the traditional Fourth of July reception, to which we
                    had invited hundreds of guests the previous years. Its only purpose would have
                    been to provide an occasion of personal farewell for me - and that's maybe why
                    the Embassy offered it, as some sort of consolation. I refused to hold any
                    reception at all; I was not about to try to explain or defend the Department's
                    decision as if there were some sort of need for it. It would have been very
                    embarrassing as well in light of what the Ambassador and I had said at the
                    reopening a few years earlier. Spending all that money on a reception when we
                    said we couldn't afford to maintain the Consulate would have seemed a
                    contradiction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left in '87 and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: In '87 I came back to Washington. By this time, my six year limit for
                    promotion across the threshold to the Senior Executive service had expired, and
                    I had received a letter informing me that I would be involuntarily retired - but
                    with honor - by a certain date, I think September 30, along with others for the
                    same reason. We were Cohort I, as it was called, the first group of FS-1
                    officers to which this new provision was applied.</p>
                <p>I then joined a class action suit against the Department, along with about twenty
                    others, which in retrospect I came to regret. I hadn't known any of the others
                    previously, but soon came to see that we couldn't make as strong a case as a
                    group, as some of us, at least, could make individually. Our backgrounds were
                    all different. At least that is what I thought about the one I could have made
                    on my own.</p>
                <p>However, as members of a class action suit, the Department extended us as
                    employees until the suit was decided. But it kept us in limbo in the Department,
                    so to speak. We couldn't be regularly assigned as we had been in the Service,
                    and couldn't compete for positions. To earn our salary, we had to find an office
                    which could use our voluntary services. I did work in two, one dealing with
                    labor union relations toward Poland where I was appreciated. I also worked for a
                    time in an office dealing with technology policy.</p>
                <p>As far as the Personnel Office was concerned, we were simply marking time until
                    the suit was decided, and they could formally retire us.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>I found this limbo status demeaning and soon was fed up with it. So in June of
                    the following year, I told Personnel I would accept involuntary retirement as of
                    July 1, 1988, even though the class action suit was still unsettled. Because I
                    hadn't been promoted to the Senior Service which I considered the Department's
                    loss, I looked forward to kicking the dust of the Department off of my heels and
                    doing something more satisfying. But since I had been one of the original
                    members in the suit, I felt obliged to stay in it. We were contributing our own
                    money to pay a prestigious firm of attorneys to bring the suit. Before and
                    during my retirement, I did research on a voluntary basis for the firm to keep
                    costs down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the suit come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: It wasn't argued in court, but before the Grievance Panel of the
                    Department, and summarily dismissed. As I recall, we lost on all counts. I had
                    long lost all enthusiasm for it anyway, but was also disappointed at how weakly
                    I thought our attorney made our case. Also, I had come to realize that if the
                    Panel gave us justice, the Department would probably have been forced to reopen
                    an innumerable number of cases in which they had retired people involuntarily.
                    So, as I saw it, it was a grievance the Department couldn't possibly afford to
                    yield on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A personal question. You were talking before this
                        interview that you've been a pilot for a long time. That hobby of aviation,
                        how did it play in your Foreign Service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Well, I don't think it helped or hurt my career. It was strictly a
                    hobby. I had wanted to be a pilot from the time I was a little boy. I can still
                    remember saying to myself as a little boy, “Why would anyone want to drive, if
                    they could fly?” Already then, I was in love with flying. I built models, and
                    when in the 7th or 8th grade began study of the theory with a course my older
                    brother had bought for me. I was set on becoming a Navy aircraft carrier pilot.
                    Then in the eighth grade, along came this vocational director for of the Society
                    of the Divine Word, a missionary order of the Catholic Church. He sold me and my
                    closest friend on this vocation. So for high school I went to a boarding school,
                    a so-called minor seminary for boys wishing to become members of the Order. I
                    was on this track until I left the Order at the age of 26.</p>
                <p>But I never lost my love for flying. When I was at the Seminary in Techny,
                    Illinois, between Glenview and Northbrook, Glenview Naval Air Station was still
                    operational. Every time those planes flew over I would gawk at them, whatever I
                    was supposed to be doing at the time, like meditating with my eyes down.</p>
                <p>I left the Seminary and went the University of Chicago in 1954, and the desire to
                    fly stayed with me. While there I took a couple of informal lessons in a Piper
                    Cub from a medical intern who had been an instructor in the Army Air Force.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>Then, after I entered the Foreign Service, at every post, especially while I was
                    in Washington, I'd go out to the local airports and find out what it would cost
                    to take lessons, and decide I couldn't afford them. Finally, in Italy toward the
                    end of my tour in Genoa and transfer to Rome, I decided it was almost affordable
                    and would give it a try. I rationalized the cost by telling myself it was time
                    to find out if flying was really for me. Maybe I would find that it no longer
                    thrilled me. I had a couple of lessons there which only fanned my desire into a
                    passion.</p>
                <p>I no sooner got to Rome on assignment as a political officer in 1974, than I
                    joined the Flying Club there, at Urbe Airport, along the Tiber just north of
                    Rome. On downwind in the pattern, St. Peter's dome was a one o'clock. To commute
                    in Rome I had bought a 10 year old Alfa Romeo sport car from an FSN in Genoa. At
                    lunch time once or twice a week, I raced out to the airport for a lesson instead
                    of eating. I also took lessons on weekends when I could. My bed time reading was
                    a Jeppesen flight manual, which probably saved my life with the wisdom it
                    imparted, because the instruction I received from a retired Italian Air Force
                    colonel was very inadequate. I did get the basic Italian license which gave me
                    limited privileges. What the Italians did in style in contrast to the FAA here
                    is give you an impressive official ID-like license with photo, and a leather
                    bound logbook with entries officially stamped and signed. I still have them as
                    trophies. The FAA until recently only gave you a flimsy piece of paper.</p>
                <p>When I realized I didn't have enough time left to get the full Italian equivalent
                    to a U.S. private license, I joined the Navy Flying Club in Naples. I took a
                    week's vacation, stayed at a pensione, and monopolized the Club's instructor who
                    was also its manager and mechanic. When I wasn't flying with him, I was studying
                    the manuals. When I wasn't studying the manuals, I was doing flight planning
                    with the charts. It was total immersion, the best way to learn anything. I
                    fulfilled all the remaining requirements for a U.S. private license. The
                    required solo cross country from Naples to Bari to Sicily and back to Naples
                    remains the most exciting - and dangerous - flight ever of my life. Someday I'll
                    write it up for submission to a flying magazine.</p>
                <p>Now in my senior years flying kind of sustains me. It's the one hobby, activity,
                    which still excites me. As a senior so much in life is in the category of “Been
                    there, done that.” I love golf too, but I do that mainly for exercise. My main
                    joy for which I don't hesitate to spend whatever is necessary is flying. I never
                    thought I would be able to own my own plane, but have owned one since 1981 when
                    I saw I could “almost afford” a used one built thirty years ago. My wife and I
                    flew it to the West Coast and back in 2004.</p>
                <p>The real thrill of flying is being up there, soaring like a bird and dancing with
                    the clouds as a poet put it, while looking down on the rest of humanity, pasted
                    to the earth by gravity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, This might be a good place to end. We've got you
                        dancing in the clouds. Great!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BASTIANI: Okay. Thank you.</p>
