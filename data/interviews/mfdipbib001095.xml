                <p>Interviewed by: Morris Weisz </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 14, 1992</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Morris Weisz and I am interviewing an old friend
                        and a former labor officer in the Foreign Service, Henri Sokolove. Henri and
                        I worked together in the War Production Board and we are going to go very
                        briefly through his career until he came into the Foreign Service. Also on
                        this tape is Mrs. Henri Sokolove, Hazel, who will help us identify the
                        different posts and the approximate dates of service at each of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Henri, why don't you begin by giving us a few minutes on your background, your
                    education, where you were born, etc. until you came to work for the government
                    in the N.R.A. [National Recovery Administration]?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I came to the Government in 1933
                    in the National Recovery Administration. I got into the labor program in the War
                    Production Board in 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in the Labor Productivity Division of the War
                        Production Board, where we were colleagues working for Joe Keenan. Then at
                        the end of the war we each went our different ways. I went back to the
                        National Labor Relations Board and you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration
                    (UNRRA), which was headed by La Guardia at that time.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: First La Guardia, then Ben Kaiser.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: A man who doesn't play any role in our business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't in labor work at UNRRA, just relief
                        activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right. In China. That's when I went to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the list of areas where you served. It does have a
                        number of places in China. Would you please give us the succession of the
                        places where you served in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Shanghai, Hangzhou (Hopei Province), and somewhere in north China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: A year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in relief activities? No labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right. No labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: He came back for a variety of reasons which I am not privileged to
                    know or discuss.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What's that?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Well, you never explained why you wanted to come back since China
                    was your great love.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Where did I go?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: You came back to the United States and applied for a position in
                    the State Department in the Foreign Service, and you were admitted as an FSO,
                    first as an FSR, and then as an FSO. Then in 1948, you went to India as a Labor
                    Attach�.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the sequence that we want. So what it amounts to is
                        that your relief activities, as valuable and interesting as they were, were
                        not in the labor field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you reentered the labor field...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: In 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...being assigned to New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in New Delhi, according to the records that we have,
                        you spent the following years, and let me just get those...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Five years, 1948 to 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All I can tell you is that our friend Harold Davey in the
                        Labor Department has gotten out a big list of places where labor officers
                        have served and, according to him, Henri Sokolove was assigned to India
                        seven different years from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: 1948 to 1953 is what I have always said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's get that down. Well, he [Davey] may be wrong.
                        He has you down from 1948 to Dave Burgess's arrival, which he has as 1955.
                        Are you telling me that there were three years [in which Embassy New Delhi
                        was] without a Labor Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: That's all right. Either that or maybe Edith Wall performed the
                    function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Edith Wall there at the time you came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: She came later. She came after 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy. We are going to have a good time correcting the
                        careful records of our friend Harold Davey, who has Edith Wall coming in
                        1950, which would have been after you came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: We came in 1948 and I think she probably came in 1950. That is
                    conceivable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was your Assistant Labor Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you had been there a couple of years she came in
                        1950 and she stayed three or four years with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Who was the Ambassador at the time?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: We started with Loy Henderson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God! Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Was Henderson before Bowles?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Bowles came for his first tour. I was there for his
                        second. What were the outlines of your function? Did he tell you what to do?
                        Or did you just go out and make your own contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: The latter.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I might add always the latter. No matter what post he was in he
                    set the program.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: That's a fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If that's a fact, let's have it down. Don't be overly
                        modest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: It's not a matter of being modest, it's a matter of being accurate.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: That's right and I want to be accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I want both of you to be accurate. Okay, you then sort
                        of made your own thing. Just let me tell you why I think that is quiet
                        relevant, because, as distinguished from when I came, there was a very
                        different understanding, namely I came there to prepare a labor program. I
                        got all sorts of materials as to what they wanted me to do. I had to talk
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Now, where was this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I came to India. So you came there with sort of an
                        open assignment and you started making your contacts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any limitation on who you could approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: None.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you either encouraged or discouraged from seeing the
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Neither. Just go out and do your thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including making contact with the Communist trade
                        unions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting because this is another difference
                        between your service and others, in which we were discouraged or forbidden
                        in some cases from contacting the [Communists].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Oh, really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my case, I was forbidden in many cases from getting in
                        touch with them because the Cold War was a little older. It was after 1962.
                        So you sort of went off on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right. Let me make it clear that the Communists wouldn't have wanted to
                    have any contact with the American Embassy whatsoever, so whatever contacts I
                    had were just casual, accidental [contacts]. They were not structured in any way
                    either by me or them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Dange the head of the [Communist] union at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he lasted a long time. Okay, the next question on our
                        list is how you worked within the framework of the Embassy? I take it you
                        were sort of separate from it? Were you a member of the country team? Was
                        there a country team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, there was no country team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You reported to whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I reported to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, as far as the Ambassador was concerned, our relationship
                    administratively was that I reported to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To him directly, not through the political or the economic
                        counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right, but in fact as far as reporting was concerned, and underscore
                    the word reporting, I reported to Washington. Nobody in the Embassy knew other
                    than by reading my despatches what was going on, and, of course, Washington was
                    just a listening area. They took what I wrote and filed it away. Nobody ever
                    instructed me what to do or not to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it became much more structured in other cases under
                        different circumstances. What it amounts to is that you were an independent

                <p>SOKOLOVE: Yes</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bowles took no interest at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: None.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is so fascinating</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Because he came into a structured situation. I just went on doing what
                    I had done before and currently then.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: There were a number of conflicts between you and Bowles. Let's
                    face it!</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: About what?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I really don't know what it was, but I'm sure it was your work. I
                    think he wanted to have his finger into it. Look, I remember it very well. There
                    were times even though he came to you when you were on leave in Washington
                    because he was told, “You see Sokolove. He can give you more information about
                    India than anyone.” So we started out very nicely. I thought we were great
                    friends and then there was this coolness. Now I don't' know what it was.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: First of all, I never felt friendly or cool toward him because what I
                    did was to write despatches about things that I was doing, so he wouldn't have
                    any reason to interfere or try to interfere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me then tell you that a guy I served with in
                        India, who later became an ambassador to Bangladesh, Howie Schaffer, was a
                        young officer when I was there in 1965 to 1971. He is writing a biography of
                        Bowles and has interviewed me at length and I am specifically going to
                        suggest that he look into that first term of Bowles in India and Bowles'
                        relationship with the labor program, so if you have anything to say about
                        that, fine. In your days Bowles was the Ambassador there under Truman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In any event your description of what you did in India was far different from
                    that of others and therefore it will be very interesting to us. You were
                    operating sort of as an independent person, with the Ambassador signing off on
                    your cables but with no effort to supplement or use your information and
                    certainly not to control or even comment on what you were talking about.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Exactly.</p>

                <p>SOKOLOVE: The labor situation was its own world. It did not impact on the general

                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right. Well, maybe it would be interesting from your viewpoint rather
                    than mine to compare or contrast that with other Labor Attach�s there.</p>

                        the next area that I want to get into and that is the AID program. We had an
                        AID program. Was this before the activities of people like Walkinshaw? Does
                        the name sound familiar to you?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the grade three. Now what we are interested in is the
                        degree to which your labor experience, in India and before that, had any
                        effect, plus or minus, on your service as a general political officer. For
                        instance, was there a Labor Attach� in Manila at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I think there was. I think there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Labor Attach� in Manila at that time was Bob Kinney,
                        whom I interviewed a couple of years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: We would have been personally friendly but would have definitely kept
                    out of each other's hair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can imagine that. You knew Kinney of course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed him last year. In any event we have his
                        recollections of it, but let me go a little into the [question] of why we
                        are interested in it, and that is this: We have had cases in which a former
                        labor attach� becomes a political officer and sometimes the head of a
                        political section with a labor attach� reporting to him or operating
                        separately. In some cases, especially where the person is a supervisor of
                        the labor attach� he tries to impose his ideas on the operations of the
                        labor attach�. In other cases, he remains very separate? What I wanted to
                        know is, to what degree did your work in Manila affect in any way Bob
                        Kinney's work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I don't know what Kinney would say, but I would say not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not at all. But if you were a political officer, you saw
                        his reporting, and he saw your reporting, but neither of you would ever
                        discuss [your work] with the other. “Gee, you know you analyze this one way
                        and I think that maybe it is better to take into account what the trade
                        unions are doing about this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, that would not have arisen. What I am trying to visualize about
                    Manila is that I was not in the Political Section. I was somewhere else.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Really?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I disagree with that because do you remember Botica Boya?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Yes, but that has nothing to do with labor.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Of course not, I am saying that it's political. It was definitely
                    political and you were... In fact, the ambassador... Who was our ambassador? He
                    didn't like the idea of you going to see these far left Filipinos.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Manila. The head of the section, or were you again

                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, I have no recollection of anything, either that I did or

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who Henri reported to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: No, I'd have to think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Part of the problem is that Manila was a large, diffuse situation in
                    which people didn't really run into the problem of who you reported to.</p>

                    convert a consular operation into an embassy, because they had been under the
                    influence of the British; so we took a ship and went to Kuala Lumpur.</p>

                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Well, we stayed a very short time because we should have gone home
                    directly and the Department said you should have some leave, so they sent us
                    home, and we never did go back to Kuala Lumpur, but the conversion had taken

                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: But it seemed to me — but I could be wrong about this — that the
                    Embassy as such treated him like they wished he wasn't there.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Why?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: It had something to do with the structure of the Embassy at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: If they had a Labor Attach� that was enough of an explanation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but you must have had some assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Yes, but that is what I can't remember. At most it was a general
                    political assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. [An assignment] which might or might not have
                        encouraged you to supply information in the labor field to the extent you
                        got it to Silverberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You were there how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: About a year and a half, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Oh, it was when we were in Japan that Henri was waiting for a
                    large sum money to conduct some project that the State Department had suggested
                    to him before he went out.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Yes, yes. Now wait a minute. I'm sure you are going to recall it.
                    And at the moment that Congress agreed that the money be given, Henri decided to
                    go home to find out if everything was going to be copacetic for that project. He
                    went home and it was in the corridors of the State Department that he was
                    running into friends, people he knew, and they wondered why he didn't accept
                    what everybody was talking about. What were they talking about? That any officer
                    who had served thirty years or close [to thirty years] who would retire and who
                    elected to retire before April 1st, I think, would be given an eight percent
                    additional bonus. When Henri came back he had already put his foot in the door,
                    because it was already finished. I mean normally he would not have been eligible
                    because he didn't get in on time. When he came back he said, “How would you like
                    to retire?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired as early as 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: He was 52 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boy, and you have been retired ever since?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Well, wait a minute. He wasn't retired ever since.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: You ought to learn by now that when people retire that's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: He became a consultant to the State Department and for seven years
                    that's what he did.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What did I do?</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: He was self-employed. I don't know what you did. You'll have to
                    tell me.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, I have no recollection of having done anything.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Oh, he taught at the Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, that wouldn't have had anything to do with labor.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: No, no. I'm telling you that from India on it was really no
                    specific labor [work], at least I can't remember it and you can't either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was for seven years until you were 59 and then did
                        you come down [to Florida]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: No, we went... Oh, I said to him, “I'm not going to live in New
                    York any more. I'm going to be home in Maryland where we had established a
                    home.” That seems to be the moment when he said, “Okay, I'm going to retire in
                    March.” And then he went with an organization that was just fascinating, the
                    Asia Society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, were you in the Asia Society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I was there before there was an Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Asia Society but that was in New York, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Right. Yes, so we stayed some more in New York and he always
                    enjoyed that tremendously and then...</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: The moral is simple. Leave before the police arrive.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I think that was it. When he finally left... and before that so
                    interesting. Before he went to the Asia Society, he was a part of USUN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: When did you do that? Was that after the Philippines?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I don't know, dear, but anyway Murray doesn't want to know about those
                    things.</p>

                        the extent to which your labor experience helped you or hindered you in
                        connection with new assignments you had. That is a very interesting
                        subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I can imagine that your interest in that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine, it's a very different experience from other people.
                        There are a few other things that I want to go over with you. The Cold War,
                        McCarthyism, civil rights. What impact did they have [on you]? Were you ever
                        accused of anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, the only thing I was ever accused of was being a reactionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, just in general. From conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the whole McCarthyism...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Didn't touch me one way or the other.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: And you must remember the McCarthy thing was while we were out of
                    the country. We really got it second hand from our friends, who were terribly
                    upset, you know about the...</p>

                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: It was an ugly, ugly period</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some cases it created real problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Yes, I'm sure it did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't have any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, to the contrary. I was a well-known reactionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that. I certainly would not have said that. But in
                        what respect [were you reactionary]? Economics or politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, in general. Some people were targeted by McCarthy and they had
                    friends. Naturally their friends tended to be very anti-McCarthy. But I didn't
                    have that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were never accused of being a Communist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: To the contrary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about McCarthyism and things like that and
                        you said that this never affected you because if anything you were already
                        labeled an anti-Communist. To that I merely reply that there were plenty of
                        people who were anti-Communists including me who had problems with
                        McCarthyism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>

                <p>SOKOLOVE: No.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: No, except to say at that time it seems to me that people like Sol
                    Oser — Did you know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very well, sure. He's another guy we had in the War

                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What about Sol Oser?</p>

                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I was just wondering if he fitted into any part of this picture
                    with either McCarthyism, because I know there were many discussions that you had
                    with... And Bob Asher, does he fit in anywhere?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not that I know of. Where did you know Bob? In

                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Oh, yes. That's right. I couldn't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, that's fine. I just wanted to make sure that you put
                        in for the record what reactions you had personally or just in general about
                        that. How about mentioning what sort of training, if any, you had before
                        going out to your labor post? You didn't need any training obviously, I
                        know. I didn't have any. Nowadays we have a training program...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I see. Well, the subject never came up, because I had already been in
                    the NRA and developed a certain pretense of expertise, so they just took me for
                    what I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the question of briefing before you went out?
                        How did you prepare yourself for your assignment? You visited people or read
                        stuff or... This is the India assignment. Did you have a general interest in
                        India or was that only after you arrived there?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, just what your relations were with him. He was sort of

                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, I am trying to remember who he was. There were two people whom I
                    knew that could have been Ashok Mehta. Which one was he?</p>
                <p>

                <p>SOKOLOVE: Beard? He must have grown that after I left...</p>

                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Oh, yes. Wasn't he the one who wrote that wonderful note to me
                    when we invited him to a big dinner, who said — because my invitations always
                    read, “Please state vegetarian or non-vegetarian.” He wrote back thanking me for
                    the invitation and saying, “My wife is a vegetarian. I on the other hand being
                    carnivorous...” That was Ashok Mehta.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, anyway, there is nothing to say about Ashok Mehta unless you have
                    some specific questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I just wanted to know whether you had any specific

                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: ...about her being a vegetarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was a serious problem. How do you entertain in
                        India in view of that since that made for fewer sit down dinners and more
                        buffets.</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: I remember once after having had such wonderful servants and the
                    tables were set for all the various kinds of food and where the vegetarians
                    should go for their food in the dining room and this was a very large party and
                    there was the sweetest Indian, a young man — he was a strict vegetarian — and
                    for some reason the head servant sent him off in the wrong direction and he had
                    to hold himself until he got to the bathroom. That was really terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You already told me that you had really no comment from
                        fellow officers about the labor work you were doing in India. They were sort
                        of separate and I would say two things on the ability to separate your
                        activities from others — and I want you to challenge that if I am wrong —
                        was related to the early stage of the labor program when it was not involved
                        so directly with overall AID policy and things like that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: That's right. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and also your general — I've known you for so many
                        years and I know your reputation and I love you dearly — but you have the
                        reputation one, of operating separately in areas of your own interest and
                        [two] of managing to get away with it without any contrary effect, without
                        any opposition. That always amazed me the ability to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I didn't know it was an ability. It was just the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. No problems with your ambassadors, I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: To the contrary, I got on well with all of them.</p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: Except with Bowles. There was a conflict there but as you said and
                    it's true, you managed it. It didn't get out of hand.</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What was that?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I will just tell you that my experience with Bowles,
                        whom I liked very much and all that, was that he had strong opinions on what
                        he wanted to do in the labor field, but those were determined by things that
                        he wanted to do in AID and in information. I was appointed there as the
                        first Labor Counselor — I don't know whether you knew that — and therefore I
                        had some functional authority over all labor work and that did create
                        problems and Bowles pushed rather hard. On the other hand I came with an
                        assignment that permitted me to argue with him and we got along fine but he
                        did try to impose his wishes and very successfully sometimes but not
                        others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What about your relations with business people? American companies? The American
                    Chamber of Commerce? None at all?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, the subject never came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There again, different from later on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...when we had a big AID program and one of my problems
                        was dealing with American companies and their labor attitudes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Human rights. Did you do reporting on human rights? Now it is a big thing of
                    course. On human rights violations? On the effect in India of the differences
                    among the various religious groups, the untouchables and all that? You didn't
                    touch that field?</p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: The subject didn't come up. The untouchables were happy not to be
                    murdered, but outside that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the problems between the different castes, so far as
                        you reported on the labor situation, were not raised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: You want to remember that in my time there was a Social Welfare
                    Attach�, who was... What was her name, dear?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't Ruby Pernell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MRS. SOKOLOVE: No. Oh, Gosh! You just pushed it right out of my head. Just an
                    absolutely wonderful person.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relation with the Assistant Labor Attach�,
                        Edith Wall? Did you supervise her? Did you tell her what to do? I know you
                        got along fine with her. You always get along fine with people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: There wasn't any problem. I think that we tended to divide up the
                    business. Initially her contacts were more with the Governmental people, who
                    were interested... She got comfortable, then we worked together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, the relevance of that to our inquiry is that each
                        labor attach� who had an assistant seems to have treated the assistant or
                        divided the function differently. In some cases the Labor Attach� would
                        carefully supervise the Assistant Labor Attach� and give little pieces of
                        the work to be done on an almost a day-to-day assignment basis. In other
                        cases there was what you referred to as the carving up of the [work]. “You
                        take care of the governmental things. I'll take care of the trade union
                        relations and we'll talk to each other very frequently with much less
                        oversight and supervision.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That answers that question. You didn't have an AID
                        program. What about your relations with the CIA if any to the extent you
                        want to discuss them? Any relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, we knew each other and ordinarily the officer whose name was
                    never to be mentioned was a personal friend who went about his own business and
                    it did not really overlap or conflict with anything I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So far as you knew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had access to your information. You didn't have access
                        to his.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a normal thing. What about the USIA? The
                        Information Agency? Did you in any way right for them, travel for them,
                        lecture for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't do any information work in the labor
                        field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: None.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on in India as you know we did a considerable
                        amount. Other international and foreign aid agencies? They weren't into
                        foreign aid at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: The ILO was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the thing that I am coming to, the ILO. The ILO had
                        an office there. Was it run by an Indian or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Frankly I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on [there was a] big conflict between the people who
                        felt they wanted an Indian there and the people in Geneva who didn't quite
                        trust an Indian to be in charge of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I see, but I wouldn't know anything about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about instructions or guidance or criticism from
                        Washington desks? Labor Department? None at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No one ever bothered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have the experience I had when they once tried
                        to tell me to do something, and wrote back that my instructions came from my
                        ambassador, not from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: What could they have wanted you to do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I forgot what it was, but it was something that Bowles was
                        very interested in and they wrote to me and sort of cautioned me. The
                        backstopper, Bergman, wrote to me and cautioned about not doing this and I
                        said, “Gee...”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: You don't want to do what the Ambassador...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was the general feeling. I said, “The Ambassador
                        gets instructions from Washington, which are signed by the Secretary of
                        State, and I take my instructions from him.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: As a matter of fact I never had any trouble with any of my
                    ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but what about your backstop? Who were your
                        backstoppers? Do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I don't know. I didn't bother to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, usually you had one in the Labor Department who sort
                        of looked over the reports you sent in and as you said did nothing with them
                        except file them and one in the State Department from that old office that
                        used to have Cleon Swayzee and Tom Holland and that group. There was
                        somebody there covering Asia. I don't know who it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, it may have been that the departments got more interested as the
                    AID program progressed but in my time I was the Gospel and all they did was bow
                    their head and nod.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congress and Congressional visits? Did you have
                        anything to do with those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: I may have had some contact with them as they went by, but nothing
                    of... You have to remember that in my time the Indian labor movement or the
                    conditions of the workers were not a matter of interest to American
                    Congressmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I get it. Do you have any comments on the role of the
                        AFL-CIO and the role of the AFL and the CIO in the selection and assignment
                        of Labor Attach�s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: None whatsoever. I was already there before they got involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, and any effort made by either labor organization to
                        control you or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No, none whatsoever.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You see the relevance of that later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Right. Oh, I can see the relevance, but they were in the embarrassing
                    position that they were supplicants for information and guidance whoever it was,
                    even Irving Brown. There wasn't any effort to... In the first place whoever it
                    was tended to develop his own notion of what kind of a guy I was and not to want
                    to tamper with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can understand that, but you can understand why we
                        are interested in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: It's as clear as crystal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I have nothing else. Do you have observations about
                        the Labor Attach� Program generally, good, bad, indifferent, effective,
                        ineffective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: No. It was part of the natural scene when I got into it and when I got
                    out of it I didn't have any strong feelings one way or another</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Fine. I have nothing else to add and I want to thank
                        you very much and I'll be thanking Hazel when we get together again and I'll
                        be interviewing her about her work as a spouse for the Spousal Project.
                        Thanks very much, Henri, and it's wonderful to see you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOKOLOVE: Well, thank you, and I'm glad to have added my prejudices to what other
                    people have said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the objective of this, not to try to avoid
                        prejudices, but to include all of them, so that all perspectives are
                        represented and that's what we don't have yet. I've been hoping that we will
                        contribute to future research in this field. Thanks very much, Henri.</hi>
