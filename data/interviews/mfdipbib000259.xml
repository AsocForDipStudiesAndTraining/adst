                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 15, 1989</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walt, I wonder if you could just give a little background
                        before we get to the Foreign Service. Where did you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm a New Englander. Born in Boston, but grew up in the college town of
                    Amherst in western Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Midwestern Massachusetts. I went to Williams, so that
                        we...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I tell you, I grew up in Amherst because my father had been on the
                    faculty at the University of Massachusetts. Subsequently, my step-father was
                    also on the faculty at the University of Massachusetts, my brother went to
                    Amherst College, and I didn't want to be a “townie,” so I went to Wesleyan,
                    completing the Little Three. I thought about Williams, but it was a little too
                    far in the woods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was, in those days. How did you become interested in
                        foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Good question. I think I trace it back to stamp collecting when I was a
                    very small child. Stamp collecting gave me an interest in and knowledge of world
                    geography, where these countries are, capitals, etc. And then the other factor
                    was the Second World War. I was about ten years old when it started, so from age
                    10 to 14, roughly, I, like everybody, was caught up in the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the greatest story that any young person who was
                        interested could have followed. Every day, there was something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CUTLER: We all had maps up in our rooms, with pins; we followed the fighting of
                    the North African campaign, going into Europe, and then there was the Pacific.
                    This naturally breeds an interest in world affairs. Otherwise, I really don't
                    think I would have headed in that direction, because I had no reason to. There
                    was no international connection in my family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: At Wesleyan this interest in international affairs continued. For
                    example, I was President of the International Relations Club, that sort of
                    thing. And then I went on to Fletcher, primarily because one of my professors at
                    Wesleyan, Sigmund Neumann, who was a fairly well-known political scientist,
                    taught also at Fletcher. He interested me in the school, and that threw me even
                    more directly and deeply into foreign affairs studies.</p>
                <p>I always had it in my mind that I would at least take the Foreign Service exam,
                    so while still in the Army, in San Francisco, I took the exam. And then I was
                    discharged and came back East to look for a job.</p>
                <p>I think, like many FSOs, I had had very much in my mind either going into public
                    service, that is, the Foreign Service, or perhaps going on for a Ph.D. and
                    teaching. My father and step- father had been professors, and so that was very
                    much in the family. But, like many FSOs, when the time came to go for the
                    doctorate, I thought: You know, I'm not sure if I want to spend that much time,
                    and I'm not sure if I want to teach, and so maybe I will try the Foreign
                    Service. And so I went into it with the idea: I'll try it for a couple of years
                    and see what happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I came in, in 1956. I came, as I said, back to the East Coast. In those
                    days (and maybe it's not so different now), one waited a long time just for the
                    results of your written exam. So even though I had taken it in San Francisco
                    while still in the military service, by the time I was discharged and returned
                    home, I still didn't know whether I had passed it or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So I came to Washington, and the first Junior Officer training course for USIA
                    was being organized. A friend of mine from Fletcher was among the entering
                    officers, and he advised me to take a close look at this, which I did. There was
                    no written exam required in those days for entering USIA, just an oral. So I
                    took the oral, passed, and they offered me a place in that course. Mind you, I
                    still didn't know whether I had passed the Foreign Service exam or not.</p>
                <p>So I had a tough decision to make, and I decided that I might as well start with
                    USIA, which I did. And the very day I started, I got the results of my Foreign
                    Service exam. I had passed.</p>
                <p>I stayed with USIA, I think a matter of five or six weeks, in their training
                    program while I then took my oral examination for the Foreign Service. I passed
                    that, and then I had another decision to make. And I decided: Well, if I'm truly
                    interested in the Foreign Service, I might as well go over to the State
                    Department now.</p>
                <p>I had some regrets. I was already assigned as a Public Affairs officer in Laos,
                    and that appealed to me a good deal. I had visions of going down the Mekong on a
                    boat with a loud speaker and a movie screen.</p>
                <p>But anyway, friends in the State Department said, “Look, you'd better come now.
                    You never know what may happen later.” So I did, I dropped out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was to the Cameroon. Was it Cameroon
                        or Cameroons in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, it was the French Cameroons. At least that's the way I think the
                    postage stamp had it. Otherwise, it was Cameroun, the French way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at the capital of Yaound�. Could you describe the
                        situation there at the time? How did we see it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: As I recall, the Department, in 1956, looking ahead at what was happening
                    in Africa and realizing that most, if not all, of these British and French
                    colonies and trust territories were going to become independent fairly rapidly,
                    did some prioritizing and came out with four countries, or countries-to- be, in
                    which it was decided we had better get a foothold, because they were likely to
                    develop into something of importance in Africa. One of them was Cameroun. And I
                    think the decision was well made, because, as you know, over the ensuing 20 or
                    30 years Cameroun proved to be a quite-stable and relatively prosperous
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest there? What would have attracted
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, we had no real direct interest. The resources were nothing like
                    Zaire, for example, the old Belgian Congo, where we already had a consulate
                    general. But it was just a matter of figuring that American presence... And I'm
                    sure that it was in a Cold War context, too, that Africa was becoming
                    independent. We didn't have the resources to set up consulates to prepare for
                    independence in every one of those countries, so we picked several of them.
                    Kampala in Uganda, I think, was another that was opened at the same time as
                    Yaound�. So the decision was made in 1956 to establish a presence, a very
                    minimal presence, in preparation for independence. And that's what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I was it. I was it, along with Bob Foulon, I think whom you've already
                    interviewed. But I arrived out there first, before Bob, and set up shop. I
                    proceeded to look around, rent offices, tried to find houses. I hired a staff
                    and so on. Bob came, I can't remember how many weeks later. And the two of us,
                    together with an administrative assistant and a secretary (there were four of us
                    there originally), opened the doors of the first American official presence in
                    Cameroun. This was in 1957.</p>
                <p>But it was also the first consulate of any kind, of any country, in Yaound�, the
                    capital. The British, as I recall, had had a one-man consulate in Douala, the
                    port, maybe for a few years, and they eventually moved up to Yaound�. But for at
                    least a year we were the only foreign official presence there.</p>
                <p>And, of course, Cameroun was a trust territory. The French were administering it,
                    and so there was a French administration. But they were making preparations for
                    a transition to local rule. And we monitored that, working with the French, but
                    we also tried to get to the future Cameroonian leaders. So it was an interesting
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find it? Were the French receptive to
                        the fact that we were making, really at this point, what was an
                        extraordinary effort for this particular area? Was it appreciated or
                        resented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I think there were mixed feelings on the part of the French. Obviously,
                    there was some hesitation, some wariness in the private French community, as
                    well as perhaps in the administration. On the other hand, I don't recall an
                    awful lot of hostility, animosity on the part of the French. There weren't that
                    many French there, really. It wasn't like Ivory Coast, where they had a big
                    commercial interest. They had some, but not a great deal, in Cameroun. The only
                    Americans were Presbyterian missionaries, who had been there for some years, and
                    a marvelous character named Phil Carroll, who was known as the American Gorilla
                    Trapper. And there was, also, shortly after we arrived, one Mobil
                    representative.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mobil Oil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Mobil Oil, yes, that was distributing. And that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the emerging leaders? How much contact, and
                        how did you develop this and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, it was possible to do that, and the French understood that this was
                    part of our agenda. But we did it, as I recall, somewhat in consultation with
                    the French. We asked then to facilitate, in a way, because it was very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>The first Prime Minister, who was really selected by the French, a man named
                    M'Bida, came from the south, I think he was Catholic, and it didn't work out. He
                    was not a successful political leader, and so he was replaced by a northerner, a
                    Moslem, Ahmadou Ahidjo.</p>
                <p>Ahidjo turned out to be a very good choice, and he lasted more than two decades.
                    And we got to know Ahidjo. Bob Foulon, particularly, as the principal officer,
                    became on very good terms with him. I played a supporting role.</p>
                <p>We got to know Cameroonians here and there. We got to know the Mayor, Mr. Fouda.
                    But there weren't that many educated Cameroonians there at that time. The
                    country was not yet independent. Many of the Cameroonians were young students
                    still in France. But we made headway, so that when independence came I think we
                    had a pretty good rapport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time of independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, I had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling?. The Department made this effort to
                        open a post there, but did you get much feedback from the Department?
                        Because at that time it was the Bureau of Near Eastern and African Affairs,
                        and obviously the Near East took precedence over Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Absolutely. As I recall, when I was first assigned to Yaound�, there was
                    really only an office of African Affairs in that bureau, and a fellow named Don
                    Dumont was the director of it. But it was a very, very thin staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>There was interest; you could sense it growing at that time - -57, '58—as this
                    wave of independence approached. One had the feeling of considerable isolation
                    in Cameroun, and yet you also had the feeling that there was an increasing
                    interest in what was going.</p>
                <p>And there was a particular interest in Cameroun, because, in those days prior to
                    independence, there was a movement called the UPC, Union des Populations
                    Camerounaiss, which was believed to be heavily backed by Moscow. This was a
                    radical nationalist group, which was not only fighting to get the French out,
                    but was really jockeying for political power prior to independence vis-�-vis the
                    other groups, which were sanctioned by the French.</p>
                <p>This made for some pretty dicey days. We lived with a curfew for quite awhile.
                    And there were some pretty gruesome massacres that occurred right in
                    Yaound�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was massacring whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: These UPC guerrillas would come out at night and, just trying to create a
                    certain amount of chaos, they would go for the French. They murdered any number
                    of French people while we were there. For example, they got into a movie theater
                    and just started hacking people up.</p>
                <p>There was a great deal of tension at the time and uncertainty as to whether or
                    not the French and other Cameroonian elements could handle this, or whether, in
                    fact, the place might be ripped apart by this movement if it really started to
                    gain momentum.</p>
                <p>For this reason, Washington tended to follow events in Cameroun perhaps more than
                    otherwise would have been the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we see the fine hand of the French Communist party,
                        which was quite subservient to Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, I think that's exactly it. Most of these had sort of shifted to the
                    Left, because of French educations and the infiltration into their movement by
                    French Communists, who funded them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, shall we move on to your next assignment? You
                        left in '59, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, I left in '59. I had spent almost two and a half years in this very
                    remote post, very much of a do-it- yourself kind of operation, but I learned a
                    lot. And then I flipped from one extreme to the other. I went back to the
                    secretariat in Washington, where I started out as what we called a night writer
                    in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what a night writer is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, he's the poor bloke who gets up at four in the morning or earlier. I
                    think I had to report by 4:30 or quarter to five. There were two of us writers
                    and an editor, and we were all in the executive secretariat. Our job was to
                    produce the morning secret summary and have it on the Secretary of State's desk
                    by 7:30.</p>
                <p>This was probably the best training I ever had in the Foreign Service. I would
                    arrive, not fully awake—the editor had come in even earlier and had selected a
                    stack of cables on a particularly urgent matter—and I was told, within 20 to 30
                    minutes, to reduce all these cables to a one-paragraph story that was
                    intelligible.</p>
                <p>And I would have to write maybe two or three of those stories. For example, at
                    that time, 1959, 1960, events in Southeast Asia were not going well, and
                    particularly in Laos. There was a very complicated situation there. A number of
                    players; the names were all very complicated: Souphanouvong, Souvanna Phouma,
                    and all of that.</p>
                <p>But, beyond that, we had an Ambassador in Vientiane who was very energetic.
                    Energetic to the point where his messages tended to have five and six sections.
                    He reported in huge detail. And I would get these telegrams, stacks of
                    telegrams, with all these strange names and very complicated scenarios, and
                    within a few minutes' time, before dawn's early light, I would have to make
                    sense of all this.</p>
                <p>I had two editors I remember, one was Nancy Rawls and the other one was Bill
                    Bradford. Both of them were excellent and demanded high quality. So that was my
                    job, and we would do this for several weeks at a time and then we would do other
                    things.</p>
                <p>I went from there on to what we called the line, became a line officer. From
                    there I was asked, along with Coby Swank, who was one of the deputy heads of the
                    secretariat, to go down to the first floor and help Dean Rusk get prepared to
                    take over as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after Kennedy was elected, but before he took
                        office, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That's right. And that was, of course, interesting. In other words, I had
                    gone from S/S for about a year, year and a half, into S at that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S/S being the Secretary's staff to S being the Secretary's
                        office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: S being the Secretary's office, right. That was just temporary at first,
                    when Dean Rusk was named and when he set up a provisional shop down on the first
                    floor.</p>
                <p>As you perhaps recall, Dean Rusk was a name that was well known, but there were
                    just an awful lot of people who thought “Dean” was a title rather than his name,
                    because, in fact, he had been a Dean at Mills College.</p>
                <p>So Coby and I, each day, coped with a mountain of letters from well-wishers. And
                    it was always a question. When they would write: “Dear Dean”, were they saying
                    “Dean” like “President”? Or was this really a personal friend addressing Rusk by
                    his first name, “Dean”? And you wouldn't know. We did a lot of drafting of nice
                    acknowledgments and so on, but we were always uncertain as to which was the
                    case.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I worked for about a month for Dean Rusk, and then he asked both Coby and
                    me to go with him to be a part of his permanent staff. Coby and I did
                    essentially the same work, though he was the senior of the two of us. So for the
                    first two years or so of the New Frontier, we were with Rusk night and day. A
                    fascinating time, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Rusk? He'd been an Assistant
                        Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and had dealt with it. He was
                        well prepared for this type of job. But how did he take it on, and what did
                        you think of his operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, of course, I was a Junior Officer, and I was quite impressed. But,
                    even in retrospect, I have tremendous respect for Dean Rusk. He had a capacity
                    for work, a personal, individual capacity for work that was astounding.</p>
                <p>The pressure in those initial days was very great. As you remember, Kennedy
                    wanted to get a lot done in a hurry, so there was no place for a laggard in
                    Washington. Dean Rusk kept that pace by virtue of his productivity and just
                    plain physical endurance.</p>
                <p>I remember one morning he came into my office and he put down on my desk a copy
                    of Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August and asked me if I had read it. I had hardly
                    had time to read the newspaper in those first six months or so. It was night and
                    day, around-the-clock work with him. In the evening he would leave the office at
                    8:00, 8:30, 9:00, with a briefcase stuffed with papers, and I couldn't imagine
                    how on earth he had ever had time to read this rather large volume. And only
                    later did I discover that he was a man who needed only three or four hours of
                    sleep at most. He would work into the wee hours, and then he would read.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>He was a very measured individual. Very sharp with respect to balanced analysis
                    of problems. Always kept his cool—almost always. Was very solid and very
                    reliable, and, I thought, intellectually very sharp.</p>
                <p>It was not an easy role for him to play, as you perhaps remember. He and
                    President Kennedy had not really known each other before he was appointed.
                    Whereas many of the other Cabinet members had been very close to Kennedy for a
                    number of years. And, for that matter, several of the Assistant Secretaries of
                    State had been named by Kennedy, as I recall, even before Rusk was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stephen Smith was one. In fact, Soapy Williams was very
                        proud of the fact that he was the first person named in the department,
                        although it was not as Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Right. And so some of Dean Rusk's deputies in the State Department had a
                    longstanding personal relationship with the President, even to the point of
                    being on a first-name basis. Whereas for Rusk, it was always “Mr. President.”
                    And the President always called Rusk, “Mr. Rusk,” which indicated, one, respect
                    by Kennedy for his Secretary of State, but, two, the fact that he didn't feel
                    that close to him.</p>
                <p>Now I was there only for the first couple of years, but, as you know, Rusk went
                    on to be maybe the longest-serving Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eight years. Eight hard years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And they didn't get any easier, with Vietnam. On the personal side, he
                    was a man of, in my view, impeccable integrity: fair, honest, balanced, and
                    personally above any kind of reproach. He was the son of a Baptist Minister, I
                    think, in the South, and he had very high morals. But very modest. An
                    extraordinarily modest man. And shy, perhaps. He had difficulty, for example,
                    moving to a first-name basis. I was “Mr. Cutler” for I don't know how long.
                    Finally, it became “Walter”, and later “Walt”.</p>
                <p>He was always very nice, but I think he believed that it would be a mistake to
                    get overly personal, overly chummy with people in the State Department. And I
                    think he was right. He knew he had to get a job done, and there was a lot of
                    mutual respect between Rusk and his Assistants and his Deputies. But not
                    probably a very close or buddy-buddy relationship, even with his Senior
                    Deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any tension, from your point of view as a
                        Junior Officer there, between Rusk and the Secretary of State's operation
                        and people like Averell Harriman and Stephen Smith and Soapy Williams? All
                        these people had either close ties to the President or their own political
                        ties. And you had Bobby Kennedy, who had his finger in everything. Did you
                        see these tensions coming on Rusk? How did he deal with it in your
                        operation, or was this not a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: If there were tensions or frustrations for Mr. Rusk, he was very careful
                    not to allow them to show very often or to get in the way of getting his job
                    done. He was an extraordinarily dedicated public servant, and he believed in
                    doing his job and keeping personal elements out of it.</p>
                <p>There was certainly a difference in style. You had a lot of very flashy people
                    around Washington in those times. Soapy Williams, for instance, was very much of
                    a politician. This was not Rusk's style, but I think he tried not to allow those
                    differences to get in the way of what, for him, was always the most important
                    thing, and that was getting the job done right for the United States.</p>
                <p>He was very loyal to the President, from everything I could see. He had high
                    respect for the President. He knew the President had the ultimate responsibility
                    for tough decisions, and he viewed his role as very much a facilitator and
                    advisor and assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might move on then to your next assignment. You went to
                        Algiers in 1962 as a Political Officer, where you served from '62 to '65.
                        How did this assignment come about? Often, when you work for the Secretary
                        of State, people in Personnel try to make sure that you get a job that you
                        want. Were you able to choose that, or did it just sort of come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, I was pleased with that assignment. I can't recall that I had to pull
                    any strings, because people were not lined up to go to Algiers. Every night on
                    the evening news you would see billowing smoke coming out of the city as the OAS
                    and the FLN and everybody else tried to take the place apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention here that “OAS” had a different context in
                        those days than it does today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was the French extremists, primarily the Pieds- noir, the
                    right-wingers, the extremists who really did not agree with De Gaulle's policy
                    of letting Algeria become independent. They tried to resist it, and even tried
                    to foment a revolution within France, which didn't work. And then, when it
                    became evident that they were not going to prevail, they decided that if they
                    couldn't have Algeria, they would lay waste to the country. So they went around
                    doing as much damage as they could.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I arrived in September of 1962. Actually, I was assigned out there as an Economic
                    Officer at first, because that was the only slot available. The consulate
                    general was going through the pains of quick growth into an embassy. And so, for
                    bureaucratic reasons, I went out as an Economic Officer, where I did serve for
                    several months as the only Economic Officer there. And then, when a more senior
                    Economic Officer was assigned, I shifted over to the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in '62 when you arrived?. Had the
                        French pulled out yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes. I arrived just after independence had been granted in July of 1962.
                    I arrived in September. The situation was, in a word, difficult.</p>
                <p>So many French, a million French, had left so quickly that the country was
                    virtually on its back. Security was minimal. Most of the utilities hardly
                    worked. So many of the houses had been blown up. A huge influx of diplomats, as
                    all countries rushed to set up embassies. And even though so many French had
                    left, housing was very short. The embassy didn't have the facilities to handle
                    this rather sizeable increase in personnel. The motor pool was virtually
                    non-existent. It was probably the most difficult environment in which I had to
                    work, or at least to move into, in my entire Foreign Service days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on the political side, as far as
                        our newly created embassy? Had they been able to develop contacts with the
                        Algerians who were taking over, or had the situation and the French excluded
                        them from any real contacts with this group? I guess it was run by Ben Bella
                        at the time, wasn't it?</hi>

                <p>CUTLER: Yes. You see, there were two groups, to simplify it. There was the
                    element in the FLN which had remained outside, had set up an exile government
                    based in Tunis. That was Ben Bella. And then there were what they called the
                    Wallayists, “Wallayah” being the Arab word for a province or region, and these
                    were the ones who stayed in the country and fought the guerrilla war for seven
                    years.</p>
                <p>The Ben Bella forces were the ones who arrived first to set up a government. And
                    there was an uneasy coalition that was established. Boumedienne became the
                    Defense Minister, and he was from this interior group. So the political
                    situation was somewhat fragile.</p>
                <p>The French had largely disappeared. They had an embassy there. They had a number
                    of people who had a lot of things to sort out with the Algerians. For example,
                    the whole question of housing, what they called the “biens vacants” and these
                    were houses or commercial establishments that had been abandoned by the French.
                    The French had left to save their own lives. And yet there was still a legal
                    question as to really who owned the property. That problem persisted for years.
                    Gradually the country began to pick itself up off the floor. It was not
                    easy.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Ben Bella, who had been in a French jail for so long, had almost forgotten his
                    Arabic. He used to speak down in the city square, and I remember his first
                    speeches were more French than Arabic, then they became sort of half and half,
                    but in due course, he regained his native tongue.</p>
                <p>There was an effort made to make Algeria an authentic Islamic country and to rid
                    the country of the remnants of the French. This went on all the time we were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of our embassy? Who was our
                        Ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Bill Porter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude not only of the Ambassador, but from
                        what we were getting there? Were there any remnants of what we used to refer
                        to as the Battle of Africa, or the Battle of Algiers, in the Department
                        between the European Bureau, which looked after French interests and, now I
                        guess it is the African Bureau, but those that say this decolonization is
                        going to come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm sure there was some of that in the department. I, frankly, can't
                    recall any such competition or tension manifesting itself with respect to the
                    department's support of the post.</p>
                <p>The environment was difficult for us, because (and perhaps quite understandably)
                    a number of the Algerian nationalists who had taken over had very fresh memories
                    of very bitter fighting with the French. They tended to associate the United
                    States, through NATO, as an ally of the French, and, therefore, they believed
                    that we were supporting the French in many ways. As a matter of fact, some of
                    the military equipment, they claimed, was American, obtained by the French
                    through NATO and used or misused in Algeria.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I just might note that, despite this very definite reserve
                    toward official Americans, when Kennedy died there was a tremendous outpouring
                    of sentiment. As you recall, Kennedy stood up in the Senate and spoke in favor
                    of Algerian independence, and this had made a tremendous impression on the
                    Algerians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say was your attitude (I'm talking about
                        you and maybe your fellow officers) toward the Algerian government? One of
                        enthusiasm: Here's a new country coming up, it's difficult, but, boy, we're
                        with you? Or one of reserve, because we were at that time worried about
                        Nasser and Arab nationalism and what does this all mean? Or was there a
                        mixture? What was the attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CUTLER: I think we were a little concerned as to the direction in which that
                    first government might go. As you noted, there was a brand of Arab Socialism
                    that was spreading in the area. And Nasser was very much the hero to the
                    Algerians. He had been very supportive of the Algerian revolution.</p>
                <p>When he came to Algiers, it was perhaps the greatest festive occasion during the
                    whole three years that I was there, even though it ended in tragedy. The very
                    day he arrived, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, a man named Khemisti, who had
                    been shot in the head six months before in front of the parliament building and
                    had lain in a coma for all those months, died. Nasser stayed only a brief time
                    and then went home. The whole country had been decked out for an extended visit
                    by Nasser, and the fervor was unmatched, really.</p>
                <p>But, in any case, back to your question. Yes, I think there was some concern on
                    our part as to this new government: Highly ideological in outlook on things.
                    Highly nationalistic. Very suspicious of the West because of the experience they
                    had had. Very heady from the standpoint of having won their independence against
                    all odds. And highly supported by the Soviet Bloc countries.</p>
                <p>Many of the teachers replacing the French, who had all left, were Bulgarians.
                    Many were Egyptians. But there were a lot of East Bloc people pouring into that
                    country, and, in those days, that was of concern to us. Algeria had a somewhat
                    strategic location, and it had a lot of oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we, when you were there, trying to do about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We were trying to get across to the Algerians that we in the United
                    States wanted to work with them. We understood what they had been through. And
                    to persuade them that, if they had to align themselves in any direction, the
                    best way to go was with the West and not the East, to put it baldly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your contact with them? Did you have trouble, or
                        was it easy making contact with members of the Algerian government or the
                        people themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Contacts were difficult in those days, very difficult. Many Algerians
                    felt that the better part of wisdom was not to be in direct touch with any
                    foreigners. There was a fair degree of xenophobia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told the Algerians are a rather dour people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CUTLER: They're different. I served in Tunisia, and I've been in Morocco. And the
                    Algerians, perhaps because of their particular history, are different. They are
                    very conscious of their nationalism and very possessive of it, sometimes in a
                    somewhat combative way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we move on. You seem to specialize in difficult, out
                        of the way places, going from the office of the Secretary of State to
                        Algiers. Then, in 1965, you went to Tabriz in Iran as the Principal Officer.
                        Was it considered, at that time, a good assignment? How did one look upon
                        that assignment then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I wasn't quite sure. I think the Personnel people thought it was a
                    good assignment, because it was a Principal Officer job. In other words, I would
                    be heading my own post, and there weren't that many of those around.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, initially at least, I had some reservations about it, because,
                    having been in Washington in that kind of a job and then in Algeria, which was
                    very much a priority in that part of the world, it seemed to me going to Tabriz
                    was very much like going on a side track. I really wondered whether, from the
                    standpoint of career and everything else, this was such a good move.</p>
                <p>In fact, I enjoyed my two years in Tabriz immensely. I learned a great deal, and
                    certainly, professionally, it didn't seem to have any...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Iran, and especially Tabriz, in
                        1965 when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was a somewhat quiet period, at least compared to what was to come in
                    Iran and what had been before, in the early '''50s.</p>
                <p>The Shah was just getting his oil industry started in an important way. But,
                    also, he was pursuing what was called in those days the White Revolution, trying
                    to reach out to the countryside and stimulate development.</p>
                <p>For example, many of the young Iranians serving in the military were sent to the
                    countryside in sort of a domestic Peace Corps arrangement, where they would be
                    social workers or medical technicians. Doctors coming out of medical school were
                    required to spend a couple of years, or at least a year, I guess, in the
                    countryside.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Tabriz, mind you, was not a regular consulate. It was a post that had been opened
                    and closed several times in this century. It was essentially a listening post, a
                    presence in a part of Iran where separatist tendencies remained strong.Located
                    in Azerbaijan, it had the duty of monitoring political and social and economic
                    conditions in a part of the country which, historically, had been occupied by
                    the Russians twice. Where there had been an independent Kurdish republic set up
                    after the Second World War, briefly. And where the Azerbaijanis were not fully
                    integrated into the Persian nation, speaking a different language and all that.
                    There had been troubles in that northwest corner of Iran over the decades, and,
                    therefore, we kept a small post there.</p>
                <p>So it was not really a consular assignment at all. As a matter of fact, we issued
                    barely a handful of visas every year. And my job, essentially, was to be the
                    eyes and ears of the embassy there and to keep the flag up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you do this? You didn't have Iranian
                        training, Farsi training, you were new.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I had studied several months of Farsi before going out. Farsi is not that
                    difficult a language, although, yes, I did not speak it fluently at all. In
                    fact, in that whole northwest area, a rather difficult dialect of Turkish,
                    Azerbaijani-Turkic, is spoken. This is a very difficult language, and I'm not
                    sure anybody in our service speaks it. And then, of course, there was a lot of
                    Kurdish spoken in my consular district, too. It would have been pretty difficult
                    to have mastered any of those languages to a useful degree. So we had some good
                    local employees, and I used to travel with my assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there dissident groups coming and saying: Where does
                        the United States stand on this? Or were your contacts pretty much with the
                        Shah's officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Political ferment at that particular time in Iranian history, in
                    Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, really was not at its height. The Shah's security
                    apparatus was pretty prevalent. If there was political dissidence (and I'm sure
                    there was), it was pretty hard to establish contact with it, because the
                    Iranians figured it was the better part of wisdom not to make such contacts.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, one could keep a thumb on the pulse in a general way. I think it
                    was probably useful to have had a presence there. Not only because of the
                    potential for political unrest, but also because that part of Iran is considered
                    the country's bread basket. So, economically, it is of some importance.</p>
                <p>We had a very small staff. It was very much of a do-it- yourself post. I used to
                    spend about one week to ten days every month on the road. It was very primitive
                    going in some parts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was great fun. It was great fun. I enjoyed it. I was one of four
                    Consuls in the country, and of course, we used to work with the embassy. But I
                    enjoyed the distance between me and the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador was whom at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The Ambassador at the time was Armin Meyer. He would come maybe once a
                    year, I don't think more often than that, maybe once or twice a year. But he had
                    a lot to do, there were four posts. The Political Counselor, Martin Herz, would
                    come more frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you gather that the embassy, including the consulates,
                        the mission there, were doing everything we could to encourage the White
                        Revolution and getting the Shah out? Or were we more or less passive
                        bystanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: One of our jobs was to try to assess the real effect of the Shah's White
                    Revolution: Was it having any impact, both in economic and social terms? Was it
                    having any positive political effect, particularly in an area which
                    traditionally had not been too supportive of central governments?</p>
                <p>My general assessment was a positive one, that slowly but surely the central
                    government, through these outreach programs, was having a positive effect on the
                    attitudes of the people and on their living conditions, but it was going to take
                    some time.</p>
                <p>I might say that the idea of establishing any kind of effective contacts with the
                    religious elements, the Mullahs, was extremely unlikely to happen, because they
                    were keeping their heads way down in order to survive. They were highly surveyed
                    by SAVAK, the intelligence and security organization. Contacts with foreigners
                    were probably not a healthy thing to pursue. We would have to do our reporting
                    on the religious attitudes through second-hand sources. I'm not sure that these
                    attitudes had begun to crystallize into highly anti-Shah attitudes at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an area that later turned anti-Shah?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes. When the revolution came, the Azerbaijanis were right with it.
                    It's a conservative part of the country, and the religious elements are strong.
                    They were just way underground when I was there, very difficult to ferret
                    out.</p>

                    course, Algeria at that time was part of the African Bureau. So, in effect, when
                    I went to Tabriz it was my first step out of the African Bureau abroad.</p>
                <p>The assignment to Korea was about the last thing in my mind. That came, quite
                    frankly, because Bill Porter, with whom I had served in Algeria, by that time
                    had become Ambassador to Korea. He needed a Political-Military Officer, and he
                    asked if I wanted to rejoin him there in that capacity, and I did so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Korea in the '67-'69 period that
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was before the great economic takeoff. In some ways you could sense it
                    coming, but I don't think any of us had any idea that Korea was going to become,
                    in just the next 20 years, what it has become. It was still very much of a
                    struggling, developing country. We had a very large AID mission there.</p>
                <p>And it was still fending off the mischief-making (to put it mildly) of North
                    Korea. In other words, security was very much a central element in our
                    relationship with the Koreans. And I was the embassy's Political-Military
                    Officer attached to the Political Section. It was a frustrating job, probably
                    the most frustrating job I'd had in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Because our own military presence was huge, headed by a four-star
                    general, as I recall. I was a middle-grade officer, and it was very difficult to
                    shoulder your way in and become a part of the political-military dialogue. The
                    Ambassador and the Political Counselor were deeply involved with that. And, in
                    effect, I was supposed to be reporting on the Korean military capability. In
                    Korea, most of my contacts were with American military officers. I did develop
                    some useful contacts with Korean military Generals and things like that, but it
                    was tough sledding.</p>
                <p>But it was an interesting time to have been there. Only a few days after we
                    arrived (as a matter of fact, I was living temporarily in some embassy
                    apartments), the whole sky lit up, as a band of North Korean guerrillas tried to
                    attack the President's palace and assassinate him.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Blue House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The famous Blue House Raid. And I had been actually involved in tracking
                    the progress of these 31 commandos, who in January, in bitterly cold weather and
                    snow, had tunneled their way under the DMZ, had emerged in South Korea, and had
                    been reported by a woodchopper.</p>
                <p>They had run into a South Korean woodcutter, and they had held him for a day (why
                    they didn't kill him, I don't know), while they hid in the woods. And then when
                    nightfall came, they released him and they headed south toward Seoul. Thirty-one
                    of them, in full combat uniform, heavily armed. Well, the woodcutter went to the
                    nearest police station and said, “I've just been held by 31 North Koreans, and
                    they're on their way south.” And he was hardly believed.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of my time at the command center in Seoul, at the Eighth Army
                    Headquarters, and the reports started coming in regarding these infiltrations.
                    There were others, by boats and so forth. But I spent the weekend trying to
                    figure out what was going on with these reported commandos. Other reports came
                    from additional sources.</p>
                <p>The South Koreans set up blocking lines. But this band of 31 commandos moved so
                    fast at night that they were actually south of the blocking lines each time. And
                    within two or three days, they were sitting on a hill overlooking the city of
                    Seoul.</p>
                <p>It was there they made their mistake. They marched right down the street, and
                    finally somebody figured that they were not “friendly” forces. A firefight broke
                    out several blocks from the Blue House, and Park Chung Hee was saved from
                    assassination.</p>
                <p>It was extraordinary, because they all dispersed after that, those who were not
                    killed, and tried to make their way north in intensely cold weather. And,
                    individually, in this fairly open terrain, they were tracked down. It took a
                    week or two before they were all apprehended, one by one. I can't remember
                    whether anyone made it back or not. The whole affair was extraordinary. And it
                    really rattled the cage.</p>
                <p>I never quite understood North Korea's strategy during the two years I was in
                    Korea. There were always domestic US pressures for us to reduce our military
                    assistance to Korea. And every time there was some serious effort to do so, the
                    North Koreans would try to pull something off, which would only buttress the
                    case of the South Koreans that we were needed one hundred percent there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there ten years later, and the raid on the Blue
                        House was still something that they were prepared against. We were talking
                        about pulling out, and the North Koreans killed several American officers up
                        at Panmunjom in a tree incident, and that, again, kept the Division there
                        probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Shortly after the Blue House Raid, there was the capture of the Pueblo.
                    As Political-Military Officer, I spent a good part of my tour, 11 months of it,
                    in an ongoing effort to devise ways of resolving that crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there dealing with the American military, and
                        later you were in Saigon, and I'm sure you ran across the same thing. I
                        think one of the interesting things is looking at the Foreign Service
                        dealing with the military, or the military dealing with the Foreign Service.
                        These are two diametrically opposed groups in outlook, yet they have to work
                        together, because this is how our American responsibility is. How did you
                        find it, dealing with American military officers? Was this a problem for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, it wasn't easy always. I certainly came away rather impressed by
                    the quality in the higher ranks. The overall commander was General Bonesteel. (I
                    was always amused, because General Bonesteel used to communicate regularly with
                    General Birdsong in the Pentagon.)</p>
                <p>General Bonesteel was a very strong-willed, intelligent officer. He had been a
                    Rhodes Scholar. He was the cream of the crop. But, as you can imagine, service
                    with a fairly strong-willed Ambassador like Bill Porter was not always easy.
                    There you had a good deal of difference of view. For example, Porter was
                    concerned about the size of our military presence in South Korea and was looking
                    for ways of reducing it. And General Bonesteel didn't agree with that.</p>
                <p>But for me, personally, I found it rather difficult only because I was a
                    middle-grade Foreign Service officer trying to deal with literally dozens of
                    high-ranking American officers. I dealt a lot, for example, with General
                    Woodward, who at the time was our man at Panmunjom. And we had a good personal
                    relationship. But, of necessity, the higher-level officers in the embassy had
                    most of the substantive dialogue going with the higher-level American military
                    officers.</p>
                <p>But I can tell you this: my experience as a Political-Military Officer has left
                    me with a very profound sense of respect for our Political-Military Officers in
                    the Foreign Service. Respect for the difficult task that they face. They have to
                    overcome what I think is a widespread perception among our military people that
                    diplomats don't understand military problems, they don't think very clearly,
                    they are always looking for ways of avoiding problems rather than tackling them.
                    In other words, there's quite a different mindset in the military and in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>But I think it's terribly important for us in the Foreign Service to overcome
                    this barrier and to deal with our own military effectively. The best way, and
                    perhaps the only way, that this can be done is to really learn their trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course many of us in our generation have served in the
                        military ourselves. I was an Airman First Class when I got out of the
                        military. Were you an enlisted man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I volunteered for the draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least we had that, which is now no longer
                        prevalent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I do think that there sometimes is a reluctance on the part of our
                    Foreign Service officers to do the homework (and it's not always very exciting
                    homework) that's required to deal effectively with the military. They deal in
                    facts and figures and all kinds of areas that are somewhat esoteric for a
                    Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>But if you're going to be effective dealing with our own military people, you've
                    got to get across to them that you know what you're talking about, and that you
                    can present your case based upon a good knowledge of their profession.</p>
                <p>It's a whole new world for many Foreign Service officers. But I think the ones
                    who have been most successful are those who have taken the time to go through
                    all the hoops and to know what they're talking about, and not come across as
                    some sort of fuzzy-minded diplomat, which is the perception that I think is all
                    too prevalent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you heartily. So your next assignment,
                        according to my records, was in Saigon from 1969 to 1971. How did you get
                        that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, in all truth, I got that assignment because Korea, while
                    interesting, did not provide the kind and level of job that I thought was
                    appropriate. And it's the only time in my whole foreign service that I had that
                    experience. Actually, the Political- Military job, within the Political Section,
                    was set up for somebody more junior than I was. And I decided it was time to
                    move on, sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p>So I went to Ambassador Porter and told him frankly that, while the year, year
                    and a half there had been interesting, I really thought that I wanted something
                    of greater substance and responsibility. And he said, “Yes, you're absolutely
                    right.” He said he would see what he could do.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, a couple of weeks later, a copy of a telegram that he sent to Washington
                    came on my desk. In typical Bill Porter fashion, he figured that he wouldn't
                    bother consulting with me, that he pretty well knew what I wanted. And this was
                    proposing me to open our new post in Ulaanbaatar.</p>
                <p>I went to him with astonishment, and I said, “Well, this is interesting. Why on
                    earth did you ever think that I would be qualified to open Ulaanbaatar?”</p>
                <p>And he said he believed that it would be a mistake to pick a Soviet specialist or
                    a Chinese specialist. He said, “I know that's what they're going to do. What
                    they need is somebody who is capable, but who has had nothing to do with the
                    area. No experience, and therefore no built-in prejudices. I just thought that
                    since you had described to me that you liked refreshing experiences in foreign
                    service, you'd be great for Ulaanbaatar.”</p>
                <p>I thanked him very much, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, by the way for the record, is the capital of... Is
                        it inner or outer Mongolia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We just call it Mongolia these days, I guess. But, as you recall, it's a
                    post that we tried to open for years. We had discussions and they never worked
                    out.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, one of my incoming basic officer classmates was Bill Brown.
                    Bill was packed off for a year's study of the Mongolian language in England, I
                    think, when we thought at one point we were going to open that post. And, of
                    course, we never did. We produced a Mongolian-speaking Foreign Service officer,
                    but with no place to go.</p>
                <p>It was only in the last two or three years we managed to open the post, but we
                    still don't have anybody resident there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just goes for a few months and comes back or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Frankly, it would have appealed to me. But what I really didn't think
                    about was that, when I sort of offered myself up for reassignment and the
                    Ambassador was fully supportive, there was one logical place for me to go at
                    that time and that was Vietnam.</p>
                <p>And, indeed, it wasn't too long thereafter that I received a message of
                    congratulations that I had been selected for a “high priority” position in the
                    American Embassy in Saigon, and did I have in any problems in going there, of
                    course without family and all the rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Oddly, I really hadn't thought too much about going to Vietnam. But when I was
                    asked to go there, I figured: Well, this is going to be a personal hardship (I
                    had children at very tender ages in terms of development, 8 and 10, something
                    like that), and yet I figured that there was a need and I had a duty to go. And
                    I figured, perhaps naively, that all Foreign Service officers were going to end
                    up in Vietnam at one point or another during the course of their careers, so I
                    might as well go now.</p>
                <p>So I agreed to go to replace Roger Kirk as the Chief of the External Affairs Unit
                    within the Political Section. That in itself gives you a little idea of the
                    complexity of the operation there. Because we had not only a Chief of Political
                    Section, but we also had a Minister-Counselor for Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>We had a very, very large operation. And as Chief of the External Affairs Unit I
                    had two principal responsibilities: One was to coordinate, working closely with
                    the CIA Station Chief and other Embassy elements, information regarding North
                    Vietnam. We were the Hanoi and Viet Cong watchers, if you will. And the other,
                    which perhaps was more substantively important although somewhat latent, was
                    working within our government and with the South Vietnamese government in
                    planning for a peace settlement: what we called “contingency planning”.</p>
                <p>So I went to Saigon in May of 1969, as I recall. My family was to be safe-havened
                    in England, and I took them as far as Beirut, where we had a brief holiday, back
                    in the days when Beirut...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Right, right. Can you imagine that? This was 1969, and the reason I
                    remember is that that was the moon walk. I remember going to the embassy in
                    Beirut, where we all watched on television the first men on the moon. So after
                    that, it was off to Saigon.</p>

                        impression. What did you think about the situation in Vietnam? Before, you
                        said you'd been dealing with other matters, so this wasn't high on your list
                        of priorities. How did you feel about the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, that was 1969, when I guess we still felt that there was something
                    to be gained by our involvement in Vietnam, and I had no reason to question
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I had had a peripheral involvement in the matter. When I was in Seoul, in a
                    Political-Military position there in the embassy, I did get involved with the
                    questions of the South Korean troops in Vietnam. This was a very important part
                    of the “many flags” that we were trying to show to the free world in South
                    Vietnam, and so I was perhaps a little more conscious of what was going on in
                    Vietnam than I would have been had I been still in Iran or elsewhere, like
                    Ulaanbaatar! I didn't question too much the wisdom of our being there.</p>
                <p>But very soon after I got there I realized that the situation was not going well
                    and was not likely to go well, even in the long term. And that it was a question
                    of working out an honorable disengagement on our part, including getting our
                    prisoners back, and trying to leave something in the wake of our disengagement
                    that was viable. That is, trying to leave a government in South Vietnam that
                    could cope for itself. I thought there was a chance of doing that. I didn't
                    think it was likely, but I thought it was possible. So we were working for
                    that.</p>
                <p>During the period I was there, 1969 to 1971, the war was pretty much on the
                    borders. It was not a period of heavy armed conflict throughout the country.
                    And, as you may recall, the incursion into Cambodia occurred in 1970, while I
                    was there in Vietnam. So one did not have the sense of a country about to go
                    down the tubes. The military situation looked somewhat improved, but it was hard
                    to imagine, over the long term, how we could get out without leaving a dubious
                    situation at best. But it was worth the chance. And we had put so much into it
                    by then, you just couldn't stop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about a dubious situation. What was dubious?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Dubious was the quality of leadership in South Vietnam and the dedication
                    and support of the people in the countryside of a central government in South
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how were we reading the support of the people? We
                        were there most of the same time. But what were the modes of trying to
                        figure out how the people felt about the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That was very difficult for me to assess. I was in a very particular part
                    of our operations there. I was external, therefore I was quite consumed by the
                    political situation in North Vietnam—that's what we tried to watch—and consumed
                    by seemingly endless preparation and vetting of contingency planning for
                    regroupment and withdrawal of our forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time Nixon was coming in, after you arrived
                        there, and this caused much of the planning for the Vietnamization, didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, but what I did, Roger Kirk had been doing for the two years prior to
                    that. In other words, even back in the 1960s (Roger was there from '67 to '69),
                    we were trying to get the South Vietnamese government to think ahead to what a
                    solution would look like. Some of this was based upon the assumption that,
                    militarily, we would come out on top, and that at some point the Viet Cong and
                    Hanoi would come to the South Vietnamese government and say: “Look, OKAY,
                    uncle.” Or at least, “Let's talk about a cease-fire.”</p>
                <p>More and more as I was there, we began to think in terms of having to seek a
                    cease-fire and to try to persuade the other side that there was something to be
                    gained from less than total victory. But, initially, what we were talking about
                    was an ending of the fighting, based upon either a stalemate or the North
                    Vietnamese suing for a cease-fire because they couldn't take any more pressure.
                    If that should happen, we didn't want suddenly to be there unprepared.</p>
                <p>So we wanted, in-house, to be sure that we were looking at these various options,
                    how it would be done and so forth. We had dozens, literally dozens of
                    contingency papers covering various aspects of an end to the fighting.</p>
                <p>Then, from time to time, we would consult with the South Vietnamese government.
                    We would take our papers to them, and, together, we would go over these papers
                    and get their input.</p>
                <p>Now on that score, quite frankly, it was always difficult to interest the South
                    Vietnamese leadership in this kind of longer-term thinking. Understandably, they
                    were very preoccupied with the war. The thought of what would happen when a
                    cease-fire came and after, was something which seemed rather remote to them. It
                    didn't seem terribly relevant to the issues, the priorities of the day.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, every two or three months or so, Ellsworth Bunker would go over,
                    and I'd go along beside him, along with Martin Herz, the Political Minister. We
                    would go and see Thieu and Ky, the top leadership of the South Vietnamese, and
                    we would discuss these contingency plans. These sessions were necessary; I don't
                    know how useful they were. At times I felt, quite frankly, that the eyes of the
                    South Vietnamese would start to glaze over a bit, because none of this was very
                    exciting. It seemed, frankly, rather remote, even sometimes to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your personal impression of the leadership, not
                        only the top, but in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the people you dealt
                        with in the South Vietnamese government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: They had some good people, but it was thin. By that I mean you go down
                    below the Foreign Minister and perhaps his deputy and, quite frankly, at the
                    middle to lower levels of the government I thought the quality was very uneven
                    at best and lacking in really dedicated, competent officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One thing that always amazed me: Here we are in the middle of a war, the American
                    Embassy working around the clock (as we tend to do around the world, but
                    particularly in Saigon during that time), you'd try to raise somebody in the
                    Foreign Ministry after five at night, and often it was difficult. They would
                    take their regular holidays and so forth, and it's marvelous, but in a war
                    situation, I thought it was rather extraordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember on a Vietnamese holiday we would run the
                        consular section, but we would run it purely with Americans, working twice
                        as hard, because our Vietnamese staff, who were, of course, essential to our
                        work, were on holiday. We were doing all the visa, passport, protection and
                        welfare work while our Vietnamese staff had the day off. We hated Vietnamese
                        holidays needless to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: In retrospect, perhaps the Vietnamese knew what they were doing. They had
                    lived with foreign invasions over the centuries, and this was the era of the
                    American presence. Maybe their more laid-back approach to life reflected a sense
                    of perspective in history, whereas we were rather frenetic in what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We tend to charge in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, looking at the embassy, how did you feel, can
                        you talk about how the more junior officers felt about the war situation? It
                        was a time of war protests and all this, and we were going through our own
                        sort of '60s movement of young officers, who were sort of bringing some of
                        the campus rebellion with them and all, and here you were in the middle of
                        this with junior officers. How did they react to the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I don't know, maybe you saw more of that than I did. I had a couple
                    of younger officers working for me in my unit of the Political Section, and I
                    didn't sense at the time any great disaffection or disillusionment with what we
                    were doing.</p>
                <p>Quite frankly, I don't think anybody had time to even think about what we were
                    doing. There was so much work, the pressures were so heavy, and we were all just
                    trying to get it done. I don't recall any major problems with respect to the
                    attitudes, the dedication of those working in the embassy.</p>
                <p>Remind you, it was a big place, and I never had time to sit around and chew the
                    fat much with younger people, or with anybody for that matter. As you recall, it
                    was sort of a six-and-a-half-day operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>But on Sunday afternoons we used to go over to Martin Herz's swimming pool and
                    engage in a literally bloody game of water polo. All of the frustrations and all
                    that other lack of [physical] activity throughout the week would come out in
                    this incredibly aggressive game of water polo. But we used to love it—blood and
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the embassy did you have the feeling that
                        Ambassador Bunker or Deputy Ambassador Berger had any qualifications about
                        what was going on? How did they feel about the situation at the time, from
                        your point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I didn't have very much of a feel for that, as far as their inner
                    thoughts were concerned. Again, it was a big operation.</p>
                <p>[SOMETHING MISSING. VIETNAM TO ZAIRE WITHOUT TRANSITION.]</p>
                <p>CUTLER: ...so I think that there has been a great appreciation for the fact that
                    Mobutu has been able to run the place and to keep it from splitting apart,
                    because I think that all along we've thought that secession, a breaking up of
                    that artificially created country, would not be in our interest, so even today I
                    see people are protesting the leadership of Mobutu. Last summer, I went to a
                    reception here in Washington, and I had to thread my way through the
                    demonstrators out front, who were shrieking for Mobutu's downfall.</p>
                <p>There are still members of Congress who think that we should cut off aid, because
                    it's so misused, and the people are abused, the human rights record is poor. I
                    don't deny any of this. All the time I was out there, this debate raged. And my
                    position was: Look, it's not perfect; it's far from perfect, but it's what we've
                    got, and we'd better be thankful that we've got even that out here in the way of
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't defeat somebody with nothing, or change
                        something with nothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, it's not just that. Yes, you can't replace something with nothing.
                    And the concern was that if we were in some way to oppose, or even actively seek
                    to remove, the leadership of that country, by doing so we would assume ourselves
                    a huge responsibility for what would follow. And there was no prospect of
                    anything or anybody following. And if the country had returned to the bloody
                    state of anarchy that it had been in, and that we had worked so hard to resolve,
                    then we would have been responsible, in large part, for doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole time you were there in dealing with it from
                        Washington, this was very much on your mind then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, sure, sure. For example, Steve Solarz was the Chairman of the Africa
                    Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, and he was very, very upset about
                    what he perceived as Mobutu's failure to lead the country in an effective way,
                    and he thought we should cut off aid. He used to come out there, and we used to
                    have long discussions about this.</p>
                <p>And my position was, as I just told you, I said I could not recommend this,
                    because there's nothing viable that we can recognize to take the place of the
                    current leadership. Better to work with what we have and what we know than to
                    simply launch off in a totally unknown and uncertain direction.</p>
                <p>Even members of my own staff at the embassy were upset by the deterioration of
                    social and economic conditions in the country and felt that we should put
                    greater pressure on Mobutu. And some thought that, regardless of how much
                    pressure, it wasn't going to change anything and, therefore, we should withdraw
                    our support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to make any inroads, or were we basically
                        giving aid and being almost an observer? Did we have any control over
                        events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes. All the time I was there we sought to utilize what limited,
                    quite frankly limited leverage we had. By that I mean a very limited aid
                    program.</p>
                <p>And don't forget, when I went out there we had just made the decision to stop our
                    involvement in Angola. And by doing so, we had left Mobutu in a rather delicate
                    and vulnerable situation. But even our aid was not of such significance that it
                    could be used as an effective lever.</p>
                <p>What was important, I think, to the leadership there was the public perception of
                    American political support. Critics of Mobutu argued that if we cut off our aid
                    and made it known that we were doing so because of our unhappiness with the way
                    the country was being governed, very quickly the word would spread among the
                    populace that the Americans were abandoning their close friend Mobutu, and that
                    this would, in turn, stimulate opposition to him.</p>
                <p>Or, put another way around, Mobutu might fear this perception of diminishing US
                    support spreading within his country, and, therefore, he would do things that we
                    wanted him to do to improve the economy for fear that we might cut off aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Basically, what we did was to try to work closely with the IMF in putting into
                    place a reform program. This was our goal. We tied our aid, to a certain extent,
                    to implementation of that program. And the program was not easy, because, like
                    all IMF stabilization programs, it required the government to make certain
                    decisions and take certain steps that are politically difficult. Like cutting
                    back on the subsidization of bread, things like this, things that a good
                    politician doesn't want to do. But we tried to recognize the political
                    importance of this and, therefore, we tried to work closely with both the Fund
                    and Mobutu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get along with Mobutu personally? How did you
                        find him as a person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I got along quite well, I thought. Let me just say this: I think that
                    nobody lacks respect for Mobutu as an astute political leader. Anybody who knows
                    Zaire and its history I think appreciates the fact that, one way or another,
                    this person has managed to hold the country together.</p>
                <p>Anybody who has met Mobutu comes away rather impressed by the person's
                    charisma—he has it, no doubt about it. He's charming. He's articulate. He has a
                    very, very strong sense of humor, sense of irony. He's a real African leader,
                    and you sense it in his presence.</p>
                <p>I saw a great deal of him. We communicated a great deal; we had a lot to talk
                    about. Not all of it was pleasant, and so it required a fair exercise in
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In almost all cases, I saw him alone. It was his call. Normally his Foreign
                    Minister was not there. Nobody was there; therefore, I didn't take anybody.
                    Consequently, I spent many hours alone with Mobutu.</p>
                <p>And I went back and spent many more hours composing my own messages back to
                    Washington, because there was no note-taker or anybody else who could help
                    out.</p>
                <p>All our conversations were conducted in French, often at his house, sometimes in
                    his office, sometimes on his boat, and that's up the river. I met with him
                    Switzerland. I met with him in the Ivory Coast, where I had to deliver messages,
                    presidential messages or whatever. And all of this over a period of four and a
                    half years. So I got to know him quite well. And, while we had a lot of
                    problems, I never lacked respect for his political prowess.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when the Carter Administration came in. I was in
                        South Korea at the time, and the human rights business (which I now think
                        probably stands as a real monument to Carter), I must say, at the time we
                        just thought: My God, this is really muddying up the waters. We have other
                        problems here in South Korea. So this must have hit you particularly hard in
                        Zaire. How did you handle this, I won't say sudden, switch, but obviously
                        tremendous emphasis and focus on human rights in a country in which we were
                        interested in keeping the man in power, and yet human rights were pretty low
                        on his priority list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, “sudden switch” is just about what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was no surprise to Mobutu. He follows the political scene in the
                    United States very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's well informed, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He's very, very well informed. He starts his day with Voice of America.
                    As a matter of fact, I learned that very quickly. I learned that I had to start
                    my day early with Voice of America, because if there was something on the air
                    that was of interest to the President or of concern to him, my phone was going
                    to ring at 7:15 in the morning. So it was very difficult keeping ahead of
                    Mobutu, with respect to developments in our own country. He has a very, very
                    strong interest in media. He was a reporter once himself, before becoming
                    President.</p>
                <p>And it was very evident in the case of our presidential elections of 1976 that he
                    had followed them closely enough so he knew very well that if Carter were
                    elected, human rights was going to become much more of a center-stage issue than
                    it had been before.So it was not much of a surprise that I showed up on his
                    doorstep after the election talking about human rights. It was good that he was
                    already aware of this, because it made my job a little easier. Because we began
                    to factor human rights into our policy in a way that it had not figured
                    before.</p>
                <p>Mobutu, of course, didn't think it was necessary, and he didn't think it was well
                    advised. He would sometimes humor me about this new-found obsession with human
                    rights. He would say, “Look at all the problems I have out here, what do you
                    expect of me? Why don't you lean on some other countries, particularly ones that
                    are not so friendly as I am? Why don't you concentrate on them?”</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I remember at that time we were not having a very good time with Algeria. He
                    picked something out of the press about human rights violations in Algeria and
                    wondered why we hadn't addressed that problem in a more vociferous way, as we
                    had with him. So he would sort of make light of it sometimes, but there was no
                    question that our points were getting across, because he kept referring to human
                    rights, even though sometimes in a fairly joking way.</p>
                <p>But it was on his mind, it was very much on his mind. And that was good, because
                    he knew that we cared, and that he couldn't go on doing certain things without
                    our taking notice and perhaps factoring it in to our own approach to his
                    needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it had any effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes, I think so. And I would like to think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of my looking in some reflection, I think that
                        probably more than almost any President, Carter, in his short time, by
                        focusing on this one point, really did have an effect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: These things are difficult to measure. I think that in the case of Zaire
                    you probably would have to measure them in terms of what abuses there might have
                    been, but did not really occur, because of the leadership's knowledge that we
                    cared. And you can't measure things that don't happen, really, very easily.</p>
                <p>Certainly, I would like to think that we had an effect when Mobutu arrested,
                    tried, and convicted, and gave the death penalty to his Foreign Minister. This
                    was a highly respected individual, and he was accused of treason. They had a
                    trial, which was partly public. (I was in there pressing for a public trial,
                    incidentally, and they put it on the radio, at least portions of it on the
                    radio, which surprised everybody.)</p>
                <p>But then the court gave the Minister the death penalty. I, along with a couple of
                    my other colleagues, appealed for human rights considerations, and, in fact, he
                    was not executed. As a matter of fact, he was made Prime Minister a year later!
                    I don't take credit for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a flare-up, wasn't there, in the old Katanga,
                        which is now called Shaba, at the time? How did we view that, and what was
                        our involvement with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That came out of the blue. That was, oddly, the first major foreign
                    policy crisis of the Carter Administration. It was in the early spring of 1977,
                    when, suddenly, reports came in that a fairly large, heavily armed military
                    force had crossed the border from Angola and was marching on the capital of
                    Zaire's copper belt, in what you said is the old Katanga Province.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>And, don't forget, this was at the time when a new Marxist regime was being
                    established in Angola, right next door, with the help of a fairly sizeable force
                    of Cubans. So there was a lot of concern about what had happened, finally, in
                    Angola.</p>
                <p>And now, all of a sudden, it looked as if that new Marxist regime might, in fact,
                    be attacking its neighbor and going for Africa's jugular right off the bat.
                    Going for the copper belt to close down the copper mines, which, given Zaire's
                    rather precarious economic situation, might actually bring down the government
                    rather quickly. That was the perception; at least that was what, in the
                    worst-case scenario, might be happening. As a matter of fact, there were reports
                    that Cuban troops were among the attacking force.</p>
                <p>It was in a very remote area of Zaire. Communications were difficult. Washington
                    was screaming for information on this. It was very difficult for us to know what
                    was going on, even for Mobutu's government, really, to have a good handle on
                    what was going on way down there on the border. All we knew was that there was a
                    force moving into the copper belt.</p>
                <p>The whole question, for us, was how serious a threat was this, and was this, in
                    fact, Soviet-inspired, supported. Were there Cubans, surrogates and so forth? It
                    was a challenge to our intelligence community, and one which was only partially
                    met, simply because of limited resources. We just didn't know what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>Anyway, what happened was that this drive was finally blunted. Mobutu, in his own
                    very adept political way, appealed not only for our help, but also for help from
                    other African states. The Moroccans responded with troops. It was viewed
                    somewhat in a Cold War context, yes.</p>
                <p>It turned out that most of the invading force were what were known as the
                    Katangan Gendarmes, and these were those who, back in the ''60s, had tried to
                    set up an independent state of Katanga, had seceded from the newly-created Congo
                    state, and had fled to Angola. They had been living in Angola for a number of
                    years, having taken sanctuary there. They saw their chance to come back. Angola
                    had become independent. Zaire had become economically weaker. And so in the
                    hope, I think, that this would cause an uprising in Kinshasa, as well as
                    elsewhere around the country, they attacked, with the idea of cutting off the
                    copper belt and, therefore, bringing down the government. It didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing during this? Were you conferring with
                        Mobutu and getting instructions from Washington? Was Mobutu asking us for
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes. He wanted military assistance. And for the new Carter government
                    this was very difficult. Very difficult to respond, because, as you recall, the
                    platform that Carter came in on was one of reduction of conventional arms, and
                    peacefully resolving regional disputes, and all the rest. It was just a terrible
                    headache for this new Administration.</p>
                <p>Everybody in Washington woke up one morning to reports of an invasion of Shaba.
                    Nobody knew even where Shaba was. Who were these people, anyway? And there were
                    some rather wild reports about Russian tanks and Cuban infantry and so on.</p>
                <p>I think, to our government's credit, we resisted a total knee- jerk reaction.
                    Nobody wanted to see Zaire suddenly come apart; but, at the same time, people
                    weren't satisfied that we had a good picture of what was going on. And so we
                    waited.</p>
                <p>And, yes, we worked very closely with both the Zairian government and our own in
                    trying to create that picture. Mobutu obviously wanted help, major help. Our
                    government decided that we would respond with limited assistance, particularly
                    logistical and non-lethal.</p>
                <p>That was quite an issue then: What is lethal and non-lethal? Is it fair to make
                    it just non-lethal? In other words, we wouldn't ship in guns. We would help out
                    with airlifting and so forth. As a matter of fact, I think we mounted the
                    largest airlift that we had ever undertaken in Africa, in support of Moroccans
                    and others who were actually sending in troops.</p>
                <p>Yes, the embassy was fully involved. And we had a consulate in Lubumbashi, which
                    was even closer. But you couldn't really get down into that area safely.</p>
                <p>And so, through various means, intelligence and otherwise, I think we probably
                    gained the best possible picture of what was going on, in a matter of days,
                    which enabled us to determine, for example, that the reports of Russian and
                    Cuban direct involvement were suspect at best and maybe not at all accurate. So
                    Washington, eventually, was able to give a positive response, but one that was
                    not an over-response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found yourself in a position of trying to keep
                        things cool while we found out what was happening. Were you inundated by the
                        international media at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes. But I must admit to you, Stu, that I now tend to get the two Shabas
                    mixed up a bit. You see, there was Shaba invasion Number One, and then there was
                    Shaba invasion Number Two. Number Two came a year later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Shaba Number One was a force moving across the border toward the capital
                    of the copper belt, Kolwezi. But it moved slowly and it never quite made it. It
                    eventually receded and the crisis passed.</p>
                <p>Shaba Number Two was probably even more of a surprise, when, suddenly, overnight,
                    Kolwezi was occupied by a force coming again, the people thought, from Angola. A
                    force that had apparently learned a lesson from the previous year.</p>
                <p>Rather than making a conventional military attack, going up one of the main roads
                    with trucks and all that, they had infiltrated through a more circuitous route
                    and, all of a sudden, using guerrilla tactics, had invested the capital and
                    controlled it, and had literally taken this copper-mining town hostage and cut
                    off all communications.</p>
                <p>They had a large number of Belgians, French, and some Americans held in that
                    town. So people woke up and, suddenly, Kolwezi was in the enemy's clutches.</p>
                <p>This was even more of a crisis, in a way, particularly since, as you pointed out
                    before in this interview, there was great concern for human lives.</p>
                <p>Well, there were a lot of civilians there who were being held captive. And, in
                    fact, there was one particularly gory scene, where a number of civilians, I've
                    forgotten how many, dozens, were slaughtered in a school house. For one week,
                    the world was riveted on how to rescue these hundreds and hundreds of Europeans
                    and some Americans being held captive in Kolwezi. And, of course, copper
                    production was shut down along with everything else in the region.</p>
                <p>This was crisis management in its ultimate form, as far as I was concerned. Here,
                    again, we learned something from Shaba One, but this was a different kind of
                    scenario. I worked around-the- clock with my Belgian and French colleagues. We
                    met in the middle of the night, I don't know how many times. It was a rescue. It
                    was how to rescue and liberate this town, and particularly after the reports
                    came out of a major slaughter.</p>
                <p>I remember an American missionary had managed to escape. He came to the embassy
                    and we debriefed him. We wanted to know who were these people who came into his
                    house. They were armed, they were in uniform. Were they speaking Spanish? Were
                    they Cuban? From what we could divine, these were, again, the Katangans, the
                    Gendarmes.</p>
                <p>Again, the whole question of Russian-Cuban involvement was very key to our own
                    government in determining how to respond. But we had a humanitarian concern that
                    we didn't have before, and that was rescuing these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Well, it was a major political issue for the Belgians, and their parliament
                    debated it rather intensively and endlessly. Meanwhile, the French took action,
                    with our help. We and the French mounted an attack, a paratroop drop on the
                    city. Within a day or so, the whole place was liberated. We, and particularly
                    the French, took a lot of credit for this.</p>
                <p>We had dozens of American press in Kinshasa, who were not permitted to go into
                    the “war zone.” I went to Mobutu, I remember, and told him that keeping the
                    whole press quarantined in the hotel and not allowing them to go near the war
                    zone, or even to be briefed by the government, was a mistake. They were
                    beginning to file very negative stories.</p>
                <p>I would like to think that I helped persuade him to do what he did the next day.
                    He routed them all out of the hotel at five in the morning and loaded them on a
                    couple of C-130s, and he, personally, went with the press and landed at Kolwezi
                    Airport to show that the airport, at least, had been liberated. The town was
                    still occupied, and that was a mile or less down the road. And then he flew them
                    back at the end of the day. It was a rather courageous and imaginative way of
                    doing it. But, I'll tell you, it did the trick.</p>
                <p>See, Mobutu's concern was that he didn't want everybody, including his own
                    people, to think that the government was about ready to fold and that this was a
                    fatal blow to Zairian security. And by landing the plane (he was at the controls
                    himself, along with the pilot) right at the airport in the middle of this siege
                    (it's typical of the kind of imaginative politics which Mobutu undertakes, very
                    effective), it reassured everybody that the government had things halfway under
                    control: Don't worry, it will be taken care of. And, in fact, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had this Dragon Rouge business, back in the old
                        Stanleyville time, when the Belgian paratroopers came in, in which we gave
                        them airlift support, too. This was, what, '65 or something like that. The
                        response usually seems to be: The Americans will supply airplanes, and the
                        French or the Belgians will drop down in there. Did you sort of keep a
                        paratroop plan tucked away? This seems to be a major response. Before this
                        happened, were you in consultation with, say, the French or the Belgians
                        about: If there is another problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, I was, in a general way. But, quite frankly, the failure of the
                    first Shaba invasion led us to believe that it was unlikely it would occur
                    again, although it was recognized that that force had retreated back across the
                    border intact. There was never really much fighting. So it was there.</p>
                <p>I think we tended to relax a bit when we determined that it was really not a
                    Soviet ploy. The Cubans were not involved, to any extent that we could
                    determine. It was a local thing. As I recall, there were communications at high
                    levels. The Soviets said: Look, we're not behind this, and we don't have any
                    interest in undermining Zaire in this way and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>So we tended to doubt that it would happen again. And we doubted the viability of
                    the force, with respect to attacking, because the area had been fortified to a
                    great extent during the intervening year. But I think you would probably have to
                    call it an intelligence failure of sorts, because they changed their tactics,
                    managed to infiltrate, came right into Kolwezi and took it in one night. So
                    there wasn't an awful lot of contingency planning during the time between the
                    two invasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the contingency plan once it started,
                        as far as arranging for the airlift and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes, round-the-clock, round-the-clock. And it was a race against the
                    clock. Because, after those first reports about this slaughter, we had no
                    assurance the Katangans (who were making demands, they wanted the government to
                    surrender and all this sort of thing) wouldn't undertake a major slaughter of
                    the whole population. And, as I say, there were Americans there, not many, but
                    it was a major concern of how to handle this. It was really a hostage kind of
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Did you consult with your French colleague on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: All the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this more or less determined, really, in Washington

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, no, it was going on in both places. We had a lot to do with it
                    there. I was in constant touch with the Zairian government leadership. It was
                    all worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were pushing for this as we were, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Not necessarily. There was a tendency, I think, for the Zairian
                    government to try to convey the idea that: Look, we can handle it. Because, when
                    you think about it, any sovereign government is a little sensitive about having
                    an operation carried on by outside forces, which it, in effect, cannot do. So
                    some of our internal talks there were rather extended and delicate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the next interview with Walter Cutler on the 29th
                        of March, 1990. Walt, we had just finished, basically, the two invasions of
                        Shaba and your working with that. So I wonder if we could talk a bit about
                        some of the other things there. In the first place, how well did you feel
                        you were served by the CIA, as far as in this fast-moving situation there?
                        This is an unclassified interview, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: As to how well I was served from the standpoint of their utility of input
                    in providing information that was necessary for policy decisions, I think their
                    performance was satisfactory. I guess I'd say that. I don't really recall any
                    particular problems along that line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the aid program there? In many
                        ways, we're looking at aid in underdeveloped countries, and there is some
                        sort of revisionist feeling about it. Did it do more harm than good? Or was
                        it really working, as far as you saw it, in Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I think it did some good. I don't remember the exact figures, but
                    considering the size of the country, the size of the population, and the needs
                    of the people, it, obviously, was not very large. I suppose if you made a list
                    of dollar amounts that we were providing to African countries, the aid program
                    in Zaire would be among the larger ones. And yet, when you look at the
                    population and the expanse of the country, it wasn't really that
                    significant.</p>
                <p>It was important in our bilateral relationship for political, as well as
                    economic, reasons. And I think that's true of many African countries. They look
                    at our aid program probably with disappointment that it's not much larger,
                    considering how rich we are. But, at the same time, they attach a fairly high
                    political significance to the continuation of the program, because it shows that
                    we care. So I think that it was of political significance, particularly since
                    there were harsh critics of the Mobutu regime, particularly in our Congress. I
                    know that there were members, including the Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee
                    of the House...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Steve Solarz, who at the time was the Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee
                    of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was very concerned about the nature
                    of the government in Zaire, primarily from the standpoint of human rights. He
                    felt that much more could have been done and should have been done by the
                    government for the people there. That this was a country which is far from
                    destitute; a country with tremendous resources. That the country, basically, was
                    being mismanaged by the government, and that there was corruption at the top.
                    This was his view of it, that there was corruption and mismanagement of
                    resources, a lack of concern for the individual.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>And I know that he was one of a number in the Congress who were skeptical (to put
                    it mildly) of the utility and the advisability of our continuing to support the
                    Mobutu government with an aid program. So, in other words, there was a very
                    definite and discernible political dimension to our aid program to Zaire.</p>
                <p>The Administration looked at it in a different way. While recognizing
                    deficiencies in the way the country, and particularly the economy, was being
                    managed, the Administration tended to look at the hard options involved.</p>
                <p>One option would be to cut off aid, as recommended by certain members of the
                    Congress and other critics of the Mobutu regime. This option was rejected, with
                    respect to how US interests would or would not be served by cutting off aid.</p>
                <p>Is this the way to induce political, as well as economic and fiscal, reform? Do
                    you threaten to cut off aid? Or do you actually cut off aid in order to get
                    something more out of a government which feels that, while it's not perfect,
                    it's nevertheless doing better than we think it is? This option was not
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>I, as Ambassador, recommended against adoption of that option. I could not see
                    how American interests could be served. In the first place, our aid program was
                    not that significant. So if we cut it off, it wasn't going to really hurt the
                    people that much, and it wasn't going to hurt the government that much.</p>
                <p>There were other sources of aid. The Belgians and the French and others all had
                    programs, which, I imagine, were larger than ours. But, beyond that, the
                    political signal which a cutoff of aid would have sent, I don't believe would
                    have been heeded in a helpful way.</p>
                <p>Mobutu certainly cared about his image in the United States. Certainly, some of
                    the opponents of that regime within Zaire would have seized upon a cutoff of
                    aid, and this might actually have increased the amount of opposition.</p>
                <p>But, basically, I could not see anything but negative results of such a move.
                    There were other ways to encourage and try to induce reform, which I thought
                    should be tried first, and that the cutoff of aid should have been left as the
                    ultimate and last step if all else failed. So I argued against that. I did not
                    agree with Congressman Solarz on this point. I saw it in a different way, and so
                    did the Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't this a rather typical thing that happens, that
                        Congress thinks in drastic terms? We're going through the same thing today
                        in regard to the Soviet Union and Lithuania. It plays better and it's
                        emotional and all, but it's up to the Administration to say: Okay, but what
                        will this mean, and what will this accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, precisely. The Administration really has the responsibility for
                    carrying on relations over the long term with a country and looking after US
                    interests.</p>
                <p>I think some members of Congress fully realize that they can advocate this or
                    that step, but they don't really take responsibility for carrying it out. It was
                    an easy thing to say in those days: We disapprove of the way the country is
                    being run. We disapprove of our money being used to contribute to the running of
                    the country in that wrongful way. Therefore, let's put it someplace else where
                    it's more useful.</p>
                <p>You can say that and take your seat, and you know it's not going to happen,
                    because that's not the Administration's view. But you've made your point. You've
                    gone on record as having stood up for what's right, as against what's wrong. And
                    life goes on.</p>
                <p>I think that had we taken that step, we would have risked exacerbating an already
                    difficult situation in Zaire. And I think anybody who remembered the early days
                    of the old “Congo Problem,” back in the early '60s when we, together with the
                    United Nations and other governments in the West, worked so hard to put together
                    anything that looked like a government in this very anarchic and chaotic
                    situation, would be sobered by the thought that it wasn't so long ago. And that
                    if you actually take steps that might be construed as trying to bring down the
                    current government, then it might not be far-fetched to think that this could be
                    a return to anarchy. If we want to flirt with the return to the anarchy of the
                    early '''60s, we'd better think long and seriously about doing so.</p>
                <p>[SOMETHING ELSE MISSING]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're saying we had this country of the different
                        tribes, the different languages, 80 more languages and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And all of that. Like most African countries, the boundaries had been
                    artificially drawn. It had been catapulted into independence probably with less
                    preparation than in most other African countries. There were a handful, if that,
                    of Zairians who had had any higher education at the time of independence.</p>
                <p>In other words, what I'm saying is that it was a very difficult birth, and the
                    country is still young. Because of this, I think that we had to temper some of
                    our unhappiness with the way it was being managed by the realization that it was
                    still young, that it's not an easy place to govern.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>And that for whatever faults he may have (and certainly he does have them),
                    Mobutu has been a political genius. I think I mentioned that the last time. I
                    think everybody recognizes that he has been an absolute political genius to
                    retain leadership the way he has, given that situation and given the
                    difficulties that country has gone through. On the economic and financial side,
                    yes, sure, I think that much more could and should be done.</p>

                        go along, but try to improve in increments how the Zairian government dealt
                        rather... Or were there sort of opponents within the Executive body who were
                        saying we should...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I don't recall there were many opponents of any consequence within the
                    Administration. I think that there was a realization that it was a very touchy
                    time in Central Africa. Angola had just come into being as an independent state,
                    but with a Marxist government. We were still concerned in those days about
                    Soviet intentions in Africa.</p>
                <p>We realized that Zaire was vulnerable, was economically weak. It wouldn't take
                    much to touch off a fire there, and nobody wanted to start playing around with
                    matches, such as trying to undermine the existing government in Zaire,
                    particularly in those circumstances.</p>
                <p>We had some very direct interests in Zaire. It was a source of minerals,
                    particularly cobalt. It was, I think, our chief supplier of cobalt, and it had a
                    lot of other minerals; if these were in some way to fall into what was then
                    viewed as the Soviet orbit, it would be very contrary to our interests.</p>
                <p>So I think that, if you will, there was a certain Cold War context in which
                    people looked at Zaire in those days and thought: You know, this country's too
                    important not to support. And, basically, Mobutu's global orientation was very
                    much in accord with ours. As I said, we were concerned about Soviet intentions
                    in adjacent Angola, where there were a fairly large number of Cuban troops. In
                    Africa it doesn't take much in the way of a military force to cause trouble and
                    instability. So I think there was pretty wide recognition within the
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>Where you found your opposition to our cooperating with Mobutu's regime was
                    primarily in certain pockets among the liberal Senators and Congressmen on the
                    Hill, particularly on the House side, among certain academics, human rights
                    advocates. And even a few people on my own staff in Kinshasa had grave
                    misgivings, on human rights grounds, about our continuing to cooperate and
                    support a government. Yes, as I recall, also in the State Department's Bureau
                    for Human Rights there was perhaps...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pat Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, Pat Derian. That was probably where the most outspoken expression of
                    concern came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this same period, I was in South Korea and we were
                        having exactly the same thing in a way. You know, human rights were there
                        and we were concerned, but we had other fish to fry concerning the very
                        definite military threat from the North.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But even our human rights people were not going to the extent of saying:
                    Let's cut off aid. It was a fairly genuine and responsible kind of concern. It
                    manifested itself more likely in such things as: How far in the annual human
                    rights report do you go in detailing human rights violations?</p>
                <p>And, of course, that's always an interesting exercise. The use of one word or
                    another, or even an adjective, becomes almost a question of policy. I do recall
                    some interesting discussions with the Department with respect to that
                    report.</p>
                <p>But nobody within the Administration that I can recall was advocating any of what
                    I would call drastic action, such as cutting off aid. They were more concerned
                    about: How can we be most effective in convincing the leadership to move fairly
                    rapidly toward fairly extensive economic and political reforms in the country?
                    That was the challenge for our policy, and that was the challenge to me
                    personally out in Kinshasa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful do you think the mission was in bringing
                        about some economic administrative reforms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I think we got a good start, because we encouraged the leadership to
                    cooperate with the IMF in adopting a stabilization program.</p>
                <p>Now what this meant was some pretty tough decisions, taking some specific
                    actions, which in the short run would be unpopular and which risked creating
                    some political instability. You've seen this around the world. Some of the pills
                    were pretty bitter. President Mobutu was reluctant to take any steps that he
                    thought were ill- advised or were rash.</p>
                <p>So it was a cooperative effort. Our government, along with the French and the
                    Belgians, British and so on, were working to support the IMF's effort to put in
                    a stabilization program that meant something, and, eventually, that
                    happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>We also discussed certain political reforms. That was a much more sensitive
                    matter, and there, perhaps, we made less progress. One of my jobs was to make
                    sure that the leadership there knew that we cared about how the country was
                    being run, not only economically and financially, but also politically. In other
                    words—human rights.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned last time, Stu, that when I went out there, I was appointed
                    by Gerald Ford, and then a year after I got there, Jimmy Carter came in, and
                    there was a much greater emphasis on the human rights element of our foreign
                    policy, particularly in Zaire. So I found myself addressing this human rights
                    issue much more frequently, directly, and forcefully, on instructions from
                    Washington, than I had when I first came out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well do you find you were served by your staff? What
                        was your impression, both at the consulates and at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Quite well, in general. Kinshasa was not a popular post from the
                    standpoint of people volunteering to go and serve there. We always had trouble
                    recruiting people, but once they arrived, they found the substantive issues
                    challenging, and they found personal life much better than they thought it would
                    be.</p>
                <p>In other words, I think it's one of those posts (and there are many in our
                    service) that have a reputation which is not altogether positive. It's probably
                    because of all of the stereotypes and images which we acquired earlier. And,
                    here again, I'm talking about the blood and anarchy of the old Congo, the Civil
                    War and so on. It was a hellhole for quite some years. I think that we remember
                    those images, and then when an assignment is suggested to Zaire, we tend to
                    resist.</p>
                <p>So one arrives with low expectations. And, because those expectations are so low,
                    I think one tends to be pleasantly surprised. We had a lot of people who asked
                    to extend. The Peace Corps (we had a very large Peace Corps contingent in Zaire)
                    had one of the highest extension rates of any country in Africa. And life was
                    tough on those volunteers, because conditions in the countryside were not very
                    good.</p>
                <p>But, coming back to the question of staff, I had a good staff. I was blessed with
                    competent and effective country team members, including the DCMs.</p>
                <p>I think that if there was any problem, that related to one particular Political
                    Counselor I had who disagreed, honestly disagreed (I think, “honestly”) with our
                    policy. And he was one of those I mentioned earlier, who felt that we should do
                    a lot more to induce reform, and who frankly felt that Mobutu was incapable or
                    unwilling to effect reforms and that, therefore, we should start thinking about
                    alternatives. In other words, a rather extreme position. He, in effect,
                    disagreed with me with regard to policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I suggested that if he disagreed, he should use established channels that we have
                    for sending in differing views to the Department, which he did. He used the
                    dissent channel, and I think he was disappointed that he didn't get more of a
                    reaction from the Department. Eventually he left the service. Most of all these
                    problems came out on the front page of The Washington Post. You know, this
                    happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, isn't this difficult? After all, we call it a
                        “country team,” and it is a team, and at a certain point there may be a
                        dispute about how we should go, but after all, your Political Counselor is
                        in charge of your Political Section, and if, after a rational discussion and
                        looking at it, the Political Counselor feels we should go right and we feel
                        we should go left, or whatever you want to call it, it really doesn't work
                        very well to have such a person there, does it? I'm not talking about
                        authority, I'm just talking about management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, it's very difficult. It was very difficult. And, frankly, it meant
                    that I had to do a lot more work myself, because I could not accept some of the
                    work that he produced. As you know, every message that goes back to Washington
                    from an embassy goes out over the Ambassador's name. And some of his views and
                    recommendations I disagreed with, and would not send out over my name. So I
                    suggested he use the established channel for sending out over his own name,
                    which he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this does hurt the effectiveness of a mission, doesn't

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It doesn't help it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much use did you find the efforts of USIA there, in
                        that type of situation and country with basically a one-man rule and all, in
                        a sort of terribly fragmented society? Is there much it can do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I think there is a lot that can be done. Probably one of the most
                    effective operations that USIA carried on was in the area of English language
                    training.</p>
                <p>We had an organization called ZALI, the Zairian American Language Institute, I
                    think is what it was called. It was right downtown on the main street, and that
                    place was just humming with activity. A lot of our spouses were there teaching
                    English. There was this tremendous thirst for the English language from Zairians
                    looking for a way of getting ahead and all the rest. I thought it was a very
                    effective way for the United States to be represented, and it brought a lot of
                    Americans and Zairians from all walks of life together. I'm a great proponent,
                    anyway, of teaching English abroad. I know that USIA has moved away from that a
                    bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Also, I'm a great advocate of USIA libraries, and many of those have been closed
                    down for security reasons or whatever. I think that's unfortunate. I thought the
                    libraries were always very useful. In general, I thought that since you had such
                    a large population, and, given the centralized nature of the government, that
                    there was a real challenge for USIA, but a real role to play reaching out to the
                    people. You had to do it carefully.</p>
                <p>We had two consulates there, incidentally: the consulate general in Lubumbashi,
                    in the copper belt, and then another one in the Kivu area. That one was sort of
                    opened and closed. I think, at the time I was there, it was in the process of
                    being closed for budgetary reasons, but I understand it opened again. But it was
                    the more marginal of the two constituent posts.</p>
                <p>But certainly the one in Lubumbashi was very good. We have had an extraordinary
                    string of Consuls General who have gone through that post. By that, I mean they
                    have gone on to higher and very significant jobs in our Foreign Service. Our
                    current Ambassador in Zaire, Bill Harrop, was the Consul out in Lubumbashi way
                    back when.I think it's interesting: If somebody were to just look up the names
                    of all those Consuls who headed up Lubumbashi, you would find that nine out of
                    ten of them have gone on to be Ambassadors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One I can think of, when I was in INR, was Terry McNamara,
                        who went out there at the height of the troubles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Dan Simpson, Parker Borg. It's a whole Hall of Fame, really. I don't know
                    why. It's always had the reputation for being a difficult post in an important
                    area, that part of Zaire having been in a secessionist mode during the civil
                    war, and, as I say, that's the heart of the minerals. But, anyway, that post,
                    during the Shaba invasions, was key. A lot of our information came from that
                    post, because it was there on the front line. So, basically, I think that it's
                    been well staffed and I was well served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your reassignment came in 1979. Could you talk a bit about
                        a rather interesting story about what your next assignment was to be and how
                        this played out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, I had been in Zaire since December of 1975. And so when December of
                    1978 came along, I was back in Washington on consultations. The normal three
                    years were up, and I was told, “Well, there'll be something else, but there's
                    not much on the horizon. If you're happy in Kinshasa, fine, why don't you stay
                    on for awhile.”</p>
                <p>And that was fine with me. I, frankly, believe that three years is the bare
                    minimum that any Ambassador should be at a post, and that moving our Ambassadors
                    every three years is not good policy. I think that they should be there longer.
                    So I went back to my post, thinking I'd be there at least for another year.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>But, meanwhile, during the end of '78 and early '79, I, like everybody else, was
                    watching what was going on in Tehran. You remember, 150-200,000 people in the
                    streets. And it was evident that the Shah's days were numbered. Khomeini came
                    back, and there was this revolution in Iran.</p>
                <p>I remember consulting with and consoling my Iranian colleague in Kinshasa. He was
                    typical of many Iranian Ambassadors who had been appointed by the Shah. All of a
                    sudden, things changed totally back home, and he had no idea what was going to
                    happen to him. He was fearful of being recalled; he didn't know whether he was
                    going to go back and be executed or what. And so during those initial months of
                    1979, because I had served in Iran in the mid-60s, he came particularly to me,
                    and also because we seemed to have the latest news more quickly than anybody
                    else in town.</p>
                <p>So my only thought about Iran was that, obviously, momentous change was taking
                    place, that it was a dangerous time. And I was concerned about the fate of my
                    Iranian friend there in Kinshasa. In fact, he was recalled, and he didn't know
                    what to do. He had no family or assets anywhere other than in Iran, and he went
                    back. And to this day I've wondered whatever happened to him.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, I received a phone call one day, I guess it was April of '79, from
                    the then-Director General, Harry Barnes. I remember it very distinctly. It was
                    on a Saturday afternoon and I was at the residence. He asked if I had any
                    reactions to going to Iran as the new Ambassador. This took me totally by
                    surprise, as you can imagine. I said I obviously would want to consult my family
                    and I'd call him back.</p>
                <p>But as we went on through the conversation, it became evident that the decision
                    had already been pretty well made right through the White House.</p>
                <p>I told him that there was no reason that I could see why I shouldn't be sent to
                    Iran, that I was willing to accept the hardships involved, including not being
                    able to take my family (I had done this once before when I had gone to Saigon),
                    and that the only thing that I could see as a possible inhibition was the fact
                    that I had served in Iran under the Shah some years before in the mid-60s, and
                    that this might cause the Iranian government, the new, revolutionary government,
                    some problems.</p>
                <p>And Harry said they had already looked at that and thought about it and didn't
                    think it would be a problem. And, in fact, as time went on, it wasn't a problem.
                    It was never raised by the revolutionary government as a reason for my not going
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>So I had very little time to pack my bag and leave. My appointment was announced
                    about a couple of weeks later. And then two weeks after that, I left Zaire. Went
                    back to Washington (here, I'm not sure of the dates, but I would say in mid- to
                    late-May). And I was to spend no more than, let's say, three weeks getting
                    confirmed by the Senate, sworn in, briefed, and off.</p>
                <p>Bill Sullivan, our previous Ambassador, had come back. Charlie Naas was out in
                    Tehran serving as Charg�. He had been through all the wars and was exhausted.
                    And that was the same with other members of the country team in Tehran.</p>
                <p>There was a feeling that we ought to really put in a new team. So, Cy Vance, the
                    Secretary of State, sent word to me that: Look, we obviously can't assign people
                    to a hardship post like this, where they can't take their families, unless they
                    really want to go. If you line up a new team, we will do whatever is necessary
                    to change assignments, etc. to facilitate this.</p>
                <p>So, in fact, I spent the better part of a week on the phone trying to put
                    together a team of the best and the brightest that I could find from around the
                    world.</p>
                <p>I had full support of the Department in doing this. It was a high priority. We
                    were very concerned at the time about the future of Iran, our relationship with
                    this new government. We knew it was tough. We were hoping in some way to find a
                    way of communicating, starting a dialogue, with Khomeini, and perhaps salvaging
                    as much as we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, in the thinking there was no idea that we
                        wouldn't continue to have a mission there and all, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No. As a matter of fact, in retrospect, I think the thinking was probably
                    unduly hopeful, positive.</p>
                <p>So I made my preparations to go. I hand-picked a number of people to go with me.
                    For example, my Administrative Counselor from Kinshasa said he would go, and he
                    started packing his bags. My secretary said she would go. And there were others
                    from the Political-Economic side. I picked a DCM from Washington, who was
                    particularly strong on the economic side, because I knew that a lot of our
                    problems were going to be financial and economic.</p>
                <p>There was a morass of questions to be sorted out. Our whole military assistance
                    program was very complicated and large. And we had all the question of assets
                    that were here, we had destroyers that were half-built but not delivered. The
                    questions on the economic and security side were unending.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>So I tried to be sure that really competent people were ready. And I think it's a
                    credit to the Service that I really didn't have any trouble finding people who
                    were willing to go off into that kind of a dicey situation without their
                    families. Because it was a real challenge, an exciting challenge, not just a
                    dangerous one.</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, I was making good progress, and I was being briefed by experts on
                    Iran. I had a two-day briefing at the State Department. I shipped my stuff, my
                    household and personal effects, to Tehran. Then I went before the Senate for
                    confirmation, and I don't recall any particular problems there.</p>
                <p>However... And this goes back, Stu, to what we were talking about, precisely. I
                    have to be very candid on this point, with respect to Congressional
                    responsibilities (or irresponsibility) relating to our foreign policy.</p>
                <p>During these days, the new Khomeini regime was arresting people and, in many
                    cases, executing them. There was a big clean-up going on.</p>
                <p>Just before I was ready to go, after my hearing before the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, the head of the Jewish community in Tehran was executed.
                    There was a fairly substantial Jewish community there, maybe 100,000 people, and
                    this caused great consternation here in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, he was executed more on economic
                        grounds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He was executed, apparently not because he was Jewish— that was never
                    mentioned—no, it was corruption, alleged corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very close to the Pahlavi regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes. And this caused a great deal of concern here, particularly with
                    respect to the fate of the Jewish community out there. Was this or was this not
                    the start of an extensive persecution of Jews in Iran—a very legitimate
                    question. As I recall, I was asked about this in my hearing, about minority
                    groups (the Bahais were others out there), and human rights. The hearing went
                    all right.</p>
                <p>But then this individual was executed, and Senator Javits became quite concerned
                    and exercised about this. He was obviously under considerable pressure from his
                    constituency to speak out about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We conferred with the Senator (I say we, I and others at the State Department)
                    about what should be done, if anything. We encouraged him not to speak out, at
                    least at that point, because we were not at all convinced that this was the
                    beginning of a pogrom or a persecution, and that Congressional action might
                    exacerbate rather than help a situation which was delicate at best. And we were
                    hoping, with a new Ambassador and a new team out there, to establish a dialogue
                    with Khomeini and to point him in some directions which would be in US
                    interests.</p>
                <p>Senator Javits seemed to understand this. And it was, therefore, with tremendous
                    surprise when the State Department learned that he had introduced and passed on
                    the floor of the Senate a fairly strongly worded resolution condemning
                    Khomeini's executions, the one in particular, and generally critical of
                    Khomeini.</p>
                <p>I would have to check my dates, but I think that that was perhaps done on a
                    Thursday evening, when there were very few people on the floor of the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>I don't recall that anybody in the State Department even knew about this all day
                    Friday, the next day. I certainly didn't know about it, and I was there having
                    consultations.</p>
                <p>On the weekend, I think it was either on Saturday or Sunday, all of a sudden the
                    news came on television that Khomeini had asked that the new American Ambassador
                    be held up.</p>
                <p>I think it was made quite clear that this was in reaction to the Senate
                    resolution condemning Khomeini's actions in Tehran. In other words, the Javits
                    resolution had triggered a reprisal. And the reprisal was to put a stop, to put
                    a hold, on the reception of a new American Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Now let me just remind you that my agr�ment had been granted by the Iranian
                    government fairly quickly. Actually, I was surprised that it didn't take much
                    longer. I think, in a matter of just three or four days, the agr�ment was sent
                    back. Although there was some question, later on, as to whether this agr�ment
                    had gone all the way up to the top for full consideration and approval. I'm not
                    sure we'll ever know.</p>
                <p>But this was the first inkling that we had, and it came on television, it came in
                    a news dispatch. I think that Henry Precht, who was in charge of Iranian
                    Affairs, had got word of it about the same time, and he was trying to reach me.
                    But, anyway, all of a sudden I was put on hold.</p>
                <p>And then, in fairly rapid succession, one thing led to another. First, I was put
                    on hold, and then the Iranians decided that they would just reject my coming out
                    altogether.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>To justify this about-face, this rather extraordinary action, they trumped up all
                    kinds of things about me, which they proceeded to broadcast and to put into
                    their newspapers and so on, that “Cutler was not the right person to understand
                    the People's Revolution, because he had served with highly centralized
                    governments, such as South Korea, South Vietnam, Zaire...” None of the
                    allegations made much sense, but they tried their best to justify their
                    action.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, they never said that one of the problems with me was that I had
                    served under the Shah in Iran for two years. Of course, I was up in Tabriz, so I
                    had nothing to do with the central government. But I thought that would be the
                    most likely argument to be used against me; it never was.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there I was. The President and Secretary of State put their heads
                    together and decided that they were not going to simply withdraw me and put up
                    another candidate. The position that our government took was: Look, this is a
                    qualified Ambassador. You have already agreed to his coming. You take Cutler or
                    nobody.</p>
                <p>So I was the Ambassador-designate for most of the summer of 1979. I knew, and I
                    think everybody else knew, there was no way that I was going to go out there
                    after this public vilification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a fait accompli, completely</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, sure, but this was a posture which we adopted. And that's when Bruce
                    Laingen was selected to go out as Charg�, to hold the fort and to see how things
                    went. And I think you know the rest of the story. I stayed back here doing
                    pick-up jobs, still as the Ambassador-designate, through the summer and into the
                    fall. And then the hostages were taken on the 4th of November. At about that
                    time there was no way we were even going to have an Ambassador- designate. So I
                    went and took a job as the Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for Congressional
                    Relations.</p>
                <p>And that was the end of the Iranian episode in my life, except for a couple of
                    minor personal things. One was that I had felt a very personal responsibility
                    about some of those hostages, because I was the one who had asked them to go
                    with me.</p>
                <p>Now when I was rejected, if you will, by the Iranian government, I got back on
                    the phone to those people who I had asked to go with me and said, “You should
                    know that I'm not going to go. It's up to you whether you want to go or not.”
                    And I think it's to their credit that they all decided that they would go ahead.
                    But they were all taken hostage, and I, obviously, felt a certain personal
                    responsibility for their having had that fate. My DCM, of course, never went,
                    the one I had selected.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>The only other thing was that I had shipped all my clothes. They were sitting
                    there in Mahabad Airport, and every time the embassy sent somebody out to get
                    them back, to ship them back to me, they were told: “Well, we can't do that,
                    because our regulations specify that the personal effects of arriving foreign
                    diplomats must be held here in bond until the diplomat himself arrives.”</p>
                <p>The embassy would say to the customs people, “Well, look, your government's not
                    allowing this diplomat to come.”And they would say, “Well, we can't help that,
                    those are the rules we have.”</p>
                <p>And so it took months and months to get my clothes back. They finally arrived and
                    all in good shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any talk, as this thing developed, of a
                        tit-for-tat thing, to say: All right, you're doing this to our embassy,
                        we'll do this to your embassy or your mission? Or was it felt there's no
                        point in pouring more gasoline on the fire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, the tit-for-tat came later on, of course, after the hostages were
                    taken. And sometime after that, we closed down their embassy, etc.</p>
                <p>What they had here in Washington was a sort of Junior Charg�. They had a skeleton
                    staff over at their embassy here. And I remember this, because I went over to
                    call on my then-counterpart. I can't remember his name, but the Charg� had been
                    a middle-level or even low-level functionary with the World Bank, I think. All
                    of a sudden, he was placed in charge of their embassy here.</p>
                <p>I remember that very well, going in and calling on him in what used to be
                    Ambassador Zahedi's office, this great big office. Of course, the huge portrait
                    of the Shah that used to hang above the desk had been removed. And this rather
                    small, bearded fellow was sitting there, quite young, looking a little bit lost,
                    quite frankly, in this huge office. I had a very formal and, I would say, rather
                    tense meeting with him, because I think he was feeling uncomfortable. It was the
                    first time he had ever done something like this. And I certainly found the
                    surroundings rather strange. The whole atmosphere there was rather, shall we
                    say, unwelcoming. I remember he gave me a little book of Khomeini's
                    writings.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I also remember (this was just before the whole problem in the Senate and so
                    forth) his asking me where I'd served before and so on, almost as if he had some
                    idea that maybe they were wondering whether I was going to be sympathetic to
                    their revolution. I think there was a great deal of paranoia at that time and
                    feeling of insecurity. This was the new government, and we hadn't yet been
                    labeled “The Great Satan” (well, maybe we had, as a matter of fact), but,
                    anyway, we were known to be the primary supporters of the Shah and, therefore,
                    we were close to being enemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to what was called H, which was
                        Congressional Relations, in late 79. Who was the Number One person in H at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Brian Atwood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was from where? What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Brian Atwood had, as I recall, not long before taken over as the
                    Assistant Secretary. I think it was when Doug Bennet was named AID Director. I
                    think Doug had been in the Congressional before. Brian Atwood had been a Foreign
                    Service officer early in his career, had left the Foreign Service, had gone to
                    the Congress and worked as a staffer, primarily to Senator Tom Eagleton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of Missouri, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes. And Brian, I don't know what else he had done, but he was quite
                    young and had become very much of a Democrat. And, of course, as you know, if
                    any Assistant Secretary job in the State Department is politically oriented,
                    it's apt to be the Congressional one. So Brian had come down from the Hill and
                    had taken this job.</p>
                <p>And the State Department was looking for a senior career officer to be the Senior
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary, because, as I recall, all of the other Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries in H were political appointees, they were people who had
                    been brought in from elsewhere. So I was to be sort of the senior career person
                    in the bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work out? What did you see? This sounds like
                        sort of a dangerous mix of having so many people who are political
                        appointees, particularly in a rather volatile time, because of the Iranian
                        crisis, but other things that were going, Panama Canal and all this. How did
                        you observe this team working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CUTLER: First, Brian Atwood is a very competent and very considerate person. I
                    enjoyed working with Brian. He knew our Foreign Service, he knew the State
                    Department, he had been one of us, if you will. And he knew the Hill, too, so I
                    think this combination of having worked both sides of the street was very
                    helpful. In his own quiet way, he was very effective and, I think, highly
                    respected. So I enjoyed working with him. It was not as if I were a fish out of
                    water.</p>
                <p>The bureau was unlike any I had ever served in before, from the standpoint of
                    what I would call near-chaos. I don't say that the bureau wasn't well managed,
                    I'm not saying that at all. But I think, inevitably, H adopts some of the
                    characteristics of its client, and the client is the Congress.</p>
                <p>The Congress is chaotic. I don't think there is any other way you can describe
                    it. Things are fast-moving: legislation pops up here and sinks there, people
                    change their minds. It was very hard to establish a work plan of any kind, even
                    for a day.</p>
                <p>It's very much unlike a geographic bureau, where things seem so ordered. Frankly,
                    it took me quite a while to adjust to this sort of anarchy, and I really never
                    enjoyed it very much. It was so hard to get your hands around anything.
                    Everything seemed to be so moveable, appearing and disappearing, that it was
                    quite a frustration for somebody who had spent many years in a different
                    framework.</p>
                <p>My bag, my particular bag, was the foreign aid bill. And, I must say, that was an
                    exercise in frustration, the likes of which I don't think I've ever experienced
                    before or since.</p>
                <p>Frustration in two respects: one, nobody in the Congress likes foreign aid. You
                    know, it's medicine they have to swallow and everybody dumps on it. It's not
                    popular in the hustings. So you're dealing with an issue that gets yanked
                    around, politically, a great deal. Here I'm talking about all of the earmarks
                    and so forth; people have their pet projects.</p>
                <p>But the other frustration was that, in principle, I was supposed to be the
                    Administration's spokesman for the foreign aid bill. In other words, the State
                    Department was supposed to be Number One among the various US government
                    agencies who had representatives on the Hill advocating their particular parts
                    of the foreign aid legislation. And that included the Department of Defense,
                    because security assistance was lumped in along with development assistance and
                    all the rest.</p>
                <p>We also had a new boy on the block at the time, and that's the newly created
                    IDCA. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>CUTLER: I don't even remember the full title, but this was an agency that was
                    supposed to be independent, the head of which was supposed to report to the
                    White House, to the President. But it worked as sort of part and parcel of AID.
                    IDCA, International Development and something Agency—an organization, which in
                    my mind never should have been created. I don't think it had a very long life. I
                    don't think it exists now, although maybe it still does on paper.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, the IDCA people were very conscious that they were new. They were
                    conscious that they had this unreal mandate and, therefore, they were very
                    aggressive in seeking their place in the sun. So they were part of this
                    Administration team that went up on the Hill, day after day. I was supposed to
                    head it, but that was terribly difficult.</p>
                <p>Another part of the frustration is that you go up and you have this myriad of
                    issues in the foreign aid bill: aid to Cyprus, population control, you name it,
                    it's all in there.</p>
                <p>There's no way that the Bureau of Congressional Relations, with, let's say, I as
                    its spokesman (and then we had these Legislative Management Officers, Foreign
                    Service officers who were there in H and were supposed to follow up on this and
                    that issue), could speak with the authority that one could find within, let's
                    say, the Cyprus desk.</p>
                <p>When a Congressman or a Senator had a question about a particular line item in
                    the aid bill that related to aid to Cyprus, I had my script, this huge book, and
                    so I had all the answers, the policy and so on, but I certainly couldn't get
                    into the guts of the question the way the fellow from the desk could. So I was a
                    bit of a middle-man. And this created a lot of work and a lot of confusion.</p>
                <p>And then, certainly, when it came to security questions the committee members
                    (and I don't blame them) wanted to talk to the guy from the Defense Department.
                    He used to wear his uniform, and, as I recall, he had three stars. And,
                    therefore, he was much better qualified to handle this.</p>
                <p>So the idea of having an Administration spokesman, from the Congressional
                    Relations Bureau of the State Department, speaking for all these different
                    agencies, I thought, was rather unrealistic.</p>
                <p>I don't know how it should be handled, but it wasn't handled very well. I didn't
                    think that I handled it particularly well, because the situation was so chaotic.
                    But, anyway, it was a colossal exercise in frustration.</p>
                <p>In the middle of this, I went off and gave speeches around the country in favor
                    of foreign aid, and it's a wonder I ever came back alive. You know, you're
                    speaking on one of the most unpopular subjects that you can possibly handle.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>And then we would have periodic, frequent meetings with the people in the White
                    House who were responsible for coordinating the various Executive agencies in
                    pursuing the President's legislative program. Madeleine Albright was actually my
                    primary interlocutor at the White House, and I enjoyed working with her.</p>
                <p>I think some people, particularly those who love politics and like working on the
                    Hill, the give-and-take, the interplay and so on, like this environment and do
                    well in it. I found it strange, difficult, and frustrating, but certainly
                    illuminating. I learned a lot about the reality of foreign policy, and that was
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is one of the things that comes up again and
                        again in these interviews, of people who have gotten involved. You know, the
                        Foreign Service really doesn't understand the role of Congress, the
                        importance, and how to play to it. And there are ways to play to it. You
                        know, often rather than saying we have our policy of Country X because of so
                        and so and so and so, we give it in Foreign Service terms, and that's not a
                        good way to appeal to a Congressman whose got a constituency. And he or she
                        is just looking for something that makes it palatable. You were going
                        through a learning process, but did you find that the people who were
                        supposed to be backing you up, Foreign Service officers in the bureaus, were
                        aware of the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, I think that they were willing to play their part, to go up. If I
                    saw that Senator X or Senator Y really needed to have a better explanation of
                    some problem, I found the people in the geographic and functional bureaus very
                    willing to do that.</p>
                <p>But, in general, I agree with what you say. And I'm one of them. I think that
                    Foreign Service officers tend to shy away from getting involved with the
                    Congress. And I think some of that stems from our primary contact with members
                    of Congress, and that's those who come out on Congressional delegations when
                    we're serving abroad. By and large, those visits are difficult.</p>
                <p>We tend to regard members of Congress as meddling in foreign policy, that their
                    interests and priorities do not necessarily match ours. Theirs tend to be
                    oriented toward their constituencies, their views tend to be short-term. Whereas
                    we are concerned about longer- term relations abroad. I think that, therefore,
                    we build up this kind of negative impression, and I think some of it's quite
                    justified.</p>
                <p>The trend, I think, through your lifetime and mine, has been toward greater
                    rather than less Congressional involvement in not only the formulation of
                    foreign policy, but its actual implementation. I think that's a fact of life,
                    it's a political reality, and we should not try to avoid it. If you can't beat
                    'em, join 'em. I think that those FSOs who have gone up on the Hill for a
                    one-year stint (and, thankfully, we have a number of programs that permit that)
                    are probably going to be much better prepared to move into policy positions,
                    because they are going to know the importance of Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Whether Congress should be as deeply involved is another matter. I happen to
                    think that, in many cases, they should not. But they are. And, you know, I saw
                    this, Stu.I think, also, the State Department is at a disadvantage in some ways,
                    and maybe it's not really right to be using FSOs. Two-year assignments: they
                    come in, they become LMOs (Legislative Management Officers), they run back and
                    forth, and then they move on. Just the way I moved on after two years.</p>
                <p>The Department of Defense has people who have spent a whole career doing this.
                    They even have offices up on the Hill. They become expert in these issues. They
                    get to know the people up there. And, you know, members of Congress tend to stay
                    on for years. So, as lobbyists, if you will, I think they are much more
                    effective than we are, because we move our people in and out so often.</p>
                <p>One other impression that I recall in this job: I was struck by how similar it
                    was to being assigned to a foreign country, where you had to establish contacts
                    with the foreign government and with the foreign opinion leaders, you had to win
                    their confidence, you had to ferret out information, you had to even entertain
                    them as part of this overall effort.</p>
                <p>I felt, in some ways, that I was assigned to the Independent Republic of the
                    Congress, and I had to go up there, I had to learn the players, I had to learn
                    who was important and who was less important, where the power centers were, I
                    had to sell my wares and so on. I was struck that it was really not at all like
                    dealing with somebody within your own government. It's like dealing with almost
                    a foreign entity. And it takes that kind of effort, at least initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Reagan's coming to power affect you, and how did
                        you see this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, here I was in this, what I call highly political bureau,
                    Congressional Relations, and, in fact, one of the first changes that was made
                    after Reagan's election was to change the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Congressional Relations—fully expected and fully understandable. Brian Atwood
                    was replaced by Richard Fairbanks, a Republican. I stayed on for, oh, a couple
                    of months, as I recall, as a carry-over. New Deputy Assistant Secretaries were
                    brought in, and these were Republicans. So it was really just a shift from
                    Democrats to Republicans, with my staying on for awhile as the Senior Deputy.
                    Then I was replaced by a political appointee, but one of the other Deputies was
                    replaced by a career officer. I think there has traditionally been at least one
                    career person there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently in the Middle East Bureau it went fairly well,
                        but in the Latin American Bureau, the takeover was a pretty bloody affair.
                        How about in Congressional Relations? Was the passing of the torch from one
                        Administration to another done fairly easily? Was there much of a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I don't recall any particular problems, but it was done fairly promptly.
                    I don't recall there was an awful lot of dialogue between the incoming Assistant
                    Secretary and the outgoing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just ships that passed in the night.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, pretty much. But you did have a core of people in that relatively
                    small bureau who stayed on, and there was continuity at the lower levels. But,
                    again, you have a whole new legislative program, and you have new people in the
                    White House and all the rest. So the change was made.</p>
                <p>When I left a few weeks later, I entered that funny year of 1981, where the new
                    people, the Reagan Administration, were, I think, very skeptical about the
                    career people. And, as you recall, it took a long time for jobs to be filled in
                    1981. These were Republicans coming in replacing Democrats, and I think that
                    there was a great concern about so-called “bureaucrats”.</p>
                <p>Some people couldn't understand how a professional could possibly serve a
                    Republican President with adequate zeal, when for the previous four years or
                    more he had been serving a Democratic President. They just can't understand that
                    professionals can actually be non-political.</p>
                <p>I had been there in Congressional Relations, which is this rather political
                    entity, and I got caught up in this long procedure of sorting out people and
                    putting them in jobs. I think there was a tendency to move slowly and carefully,
                    particularly with some of the higher-level professionals. And, as you remember,
                    a lot of our embassies were without Ambassadors for almost a full year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, you got a new assignment relatively quickly,
                        didn't you? When did you get the nod towards Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I can't even remember. I really don't know when it came. I do know that I
                    went over and served for two or three months in the Board of Examiners, and I
                    served on Phil Habib's committee on personnel policy.</p>

                <p>CUTLER: I think it was from February to well into the fall, that I did this and
                    that, waiting around. I do remember that we got out to Tunisia in early
                    1982.</p>

                <p>CUTLER: The interests at that time were not critical. It was a small, but
                    friendly and well-oriented country. It was a country about which we had some
                    anxiety with respect to designs that Qadhafi might have had on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in charge of Libya.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He was in charge of Libya next door and had designs on his neighbors.
                    Then we had an aging Bourguiba, the only President that that country had known
                    since its independence, and nothing had really been set up for a transition to
                    new leadership. So everybody expected that Bourguiba might disappear and that,
                    with a predatory Qadhafi next door, this might be a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as a preponderant Western power there, was that
                        still France, would you say, and were we playing somewhat of a secondary
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, not really. France's influence had diminished quite a bit. In the
                    private sector they certainly had a substantial representation, but,
                    politically, with the leadership, I think our influence was probably even
                    greater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major problems while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I guess the major problem was something that was extraneous to our
                    bilateral relationship, and that was that the whole problem of the Israeli
                    invasion of Lebanon occurred. And, as you know, Tunisia, with our encouragement,
                    took in Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a role in this encouragement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CUTLER: No, not really on that. I'm not sure that it really took much
                    encouragement, but that was not done through me. But I was there when he
                    arrived. And, therefore, there was a new focus put on Tunisia, with respect to
                    the Middle East question. The other thing that made Tunis of more than passing
                    interest was that that's where the Arab League was located. The headquarters had
                    been moved out of Cairo. And I was the interlocutor, if you will, with the Arab
                    League, which was not easy, because in those days the general feeling back home
                    in the State Department and the White House was that the Arab League had done us
                    no favors. In effect, they needed us more than we needed them, that was the
                    perception. So we sort of kept them at a distance.</p>
                <p>The longer I stayed there, the less I agreed with that posture. I felt that there
                    were things that one could do with the Arab League. And I think, over the course
                    of time, Washington came around to take a somewhat more mellow view of the
                    institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems, say, trying to duck Arafat at
                        receptions and things like this, because we were under strict injunctions
                        not to do anything with the PLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, no. He didn't really circulate that much, probably for security
                    reasons. And the Tunisians kept the Palestinians who arrived with Arafat under
                    very tight control. They had them mostly in an old military camp way down in the
                    center of the country. My understanding is that they were not very happy down
                    there. As a matter of fact, eventually, most of them moved out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the flesh pots of Lebanon, it must have been pretty
                        tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, pretty tough to take. Arafat himself kept a low profile, I think,
                    again, for security reasons. We knew where his headquarters was and so on, but
                    it was down on the other side of the city. And he really didn't circulate much
                    in any kind of group activities.</p>
                <p>I do recall one function at the palace. Bourguiba gave a luncheon, and I can't
                    remember who the guest of honor was, but Arafat came in. It was a large
                    luncheon, so I was nowhere near him. But, ironically, they had seated my wife
                    and me next to the Libyan, which made for kind of an interesting situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have relations with the Libyans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We weren't talking to the Libyans at that point. But, basically, it
                    wasn't a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Libyans? How did you see the Libyan actions,
                        as far as we were concerned, from the vantage of Tunis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: At the time I arrived, there was some reason to be concerned about what
                    Qadhafi's intentions were toward Tunisia. (Interestingly, I presented my
                    credentials on the 50th anniversary of Bourguiba's establishment of the
                    Neo-Destourian Party, which shows you how long he had been around.)</p>
                <p>But Qadhafi had just made his first visit to Tunis in many, many years. Relations
                    had been cool, to the point of being frigid, between the two countries, and
                    there were some good reasons to try to improve them. So Qadhafi came to Tunis (I
                    think it was right after I got there), and this was a big deal, because it was
                    so unprecedented.</p>
                <p>When I called on Bourguiba, oh, let's say a couple of weeks later, to present my
                    credentials, we went in for a private conversation, and in the middle of the
                    conversation, Bourguiba stopped and motioned to somebody to go get
                    something.</p>
                <p>A person appeared with a long cardboard cylinder, the kind that you keep maps in,
                    and he reached in and pulled out a little piece of paper. It was a little piece
                    of notebook paper, and there was a message written on it. And Bourguiba said,
                    “Eh, voil�, c'est mien main tenant.” And what this was, was the infamous Djerba
                    Agreement (of 1974, I think). And, mind you, this was now 1982.</p>
                <p>What had happened was, at the last meeting between Bourguiba and Qadhafi, on the
                    island of Djerba, when Bourguiba's Prime Minister was not present, Bourguiba
                    had, much to everybody's astonishment, signed an agreement with Qadhafi that
                    would form a union between the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of those unions...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: One of those unions; one of the originals. And Bourguiba recognized the
                    error of his way only a day or two later and renounced the agreement. But
                    Qadhafi kept it. And when Qadhafi finally came to Tunis all those years later
                    (he had wanted to do so for a long time), Bourguiba said, “Okay, but you've got
                    to bring that agreement with you and give it back to me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>That piece of paper, symbolically, was terribly important to Bourguiba, because
                    he regarded that as the one major mistake that he had made, the one serious
                    gaffe. Qadhafi arrived without the paper. Bourguiba refused to see him until he
                    had sent somebody back and gotten that scrap of paper and had given it to him. I
                    think I was probably the first one to see it. And so that's what was in this
                    cylinder on the silver tray. And he said he was going to put it in a museum that
                    he wanted to build in his hometown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation, as far as your dealing with
                        Bourguiba during the time you were there? You were there from '82...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I was there two years, early '82 to early '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him, because this was sort of in the
                        twilight of his career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes. I would say I had limited dealings with him on substantive issues.
                    His Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were the primary interlocutors on most
                    issues. I saw Bourguiba, however, fairly frequently. And, more often than not,
                    it was to pay my respects to him along with some American visitor. One could do
                    business with him, but usually it was inadvisable to try to take up more than
                    one subject at a time.</p>
                <p>Bourguiba had a very, very special feeling about the United States. And, I think
                    this was not only because he and we shared ideals about what the world should
                    look like. He was certainly anti- communist. He understood what we were trying
                    to do in that part of the world and supported it. And he shared our concern for
                    such things as education for the common man.</p>
                <p>But he also had a special feeling toward the United States which stemmed from his
                    own personal experience. And this goes way back to when he was in and out of
                    French jails. And it goes back, particularly, to one American Consul, who, at
                    least in Tunisia, is still very well known, and that's Hooker Doolittle.</p>
                <p>Before I went to Tunisia, I remember having lunch with one of my predecessors
                    here in Washington, and he said, “Well, of course, you know all about Hooker
                    Doolittle.” Well, I didn't at the time, but I soon found out that one has to
                    know the name Hooker Doolittle, particularly if you are to meet with
                    Bourguiba.</p>
                <p>Hooker Doolittle was the American Consul in Tunis during the war years, '42-'43.
                    He was among that small group of Foreign Service officers and a few others who
                    had the foresight to look beyond the war and to see that American interests
                    could and should be served by not necessarily toadying to the French for our
                    immediate military needs, but by getting to know some of the Arabs who later on
                    would be pushing for independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>And he got to know Bourguiba, who, at that point, was a young, idealistic, but
                    very charismatic nationalist leader—not exactly a favorite of the French. At one
                    point, Hooker Doolittle was instrumental in getting Bourguiba sprung from a
                    French jail. And Bourguiba has never forgotten this. He regarded Hooker
                    Doolittle as one of his closest friends.</p>
                <p>When Hooker Doolittle was later transferred from Tunisia to Egypt, Bourguiba had
                    to flee from the French again. It's the famous time when he disguised himself
                    and found his way across Libya. There, lo and behold, was Hooker Doolittle, his
                    old friend.</p>
                <p>And so when I went to call on Bourguiba, there was a certain scenario for the
                    visits. I would go to the palace and be ushered in, usually by the Foreign
                    Minister, to Bourguiba's rather small office, an office half the size of this.
                    But the walls were bedecked with photographs, and there were many mementos, lots
                    of memorabilia around this great leader's long struggle for independence for his
                    country.</p>
                <p>So I might have an item of business to discuss, but it would usually be dealt
                    with fairly quickly, with the Foreign Minister sort of helping Bourguiba, and
                    then I would have our stroll through history. Bourguiba loved to take people
                    around and show them this and that. There was a moon rock, brought back by one
                    of our astronauts. Have you ever gone to Bourguiba's office?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There were what I called the mug shots, and these were the photographs,
                    taken by the French police and security officials, of the Tunisian nationalists;
                    and one of them is Bourguiba—you know, it's a line-up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a name plate and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, all that, all that. And there was this and that, many photographs.
                    And then he would come to a photograph of Hooker Doolittle and Bourguiba shaking
                    hands beneath the wing of some old C- 47, back in 1943. And he'd say, “Eh,
                    voil�, mon ami.” And, quite frankly, more often than not he would shed a tear.
                    He became very emotional. And this is where it really all started. There's a
                    street near the embassy named Rue Hooker Doolittle.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>It's a little-known story, it's a fascinating one, and I always liked the story,
                    because it shows that there are places and times in history where a diplomat—not
                    even a high-ranking one—can actually influence the course of history. And this
                    is exactly what Hooker Doolittle did. There are some people who remember him,
                    David Newsom, for example. I think David's first boss in the Foreign Service was
                    Hooker Doolittle, in Karachi, I believe. Hooker Doolittle's dead and gone now,
                    but he had a tremendous impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's mentioned in Archibald Roosevelt's book Lust for
                        Knowing, talking about going out with Hooker Doolittle and meeting
                        Bourguiba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That's right, he's mentioned several times there. As a matter of fact,
                    when I was over at Georgetown, I started to get together material to do a piece
                    on Hooker Doolittle (he still has a daughter who is alive), because I thought it
                    was a fascinating story. Hooker Doolittle was among those, Archie Roosevelt was
                    another one, who had the foresight to look ahead.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, what they were doing, that is, messing around with Arab
                    nationalists, didn't go down well with the French at all. And, at the time, we
                    were courting French favor. We wanted their full cooperation as we tried to end
                    the war. So the French complained (I think this is in Archie Roosevelt's book)
                    about the activities of Hooker Doolittle and others, and they got into trouble
                    for it. And I think Hooker Doolittle eventually was removed. He had a
                    fascinating time when the Germans occupied, he had to leave, and he lost a lot
                    of his household effects and so on.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, my dealings with Bourguiba often were of that nature, where the
                    conversation would be friendly, close, focused perhaps more on the past than on
                    the present, and not always very substantive. Bourguiba would know the major
                    issues of the day; he would be concerned about what he had heard on the news. We
                    did talk about such things as the Palestinian problem and all the rest, but
                    conversations were never long and never terribly profound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view of Israel from Tunisia? Here's an Arab
                        country, but it's always seemed to be somewhat removed, somewhat like
                        Morocco, not as virulent towards Israel. Was that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I think the Tunisians felt very genuinely and sometimes passionately
                    sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They felt that a great injustice was being
                    done to the Palestinians. They blamed us for supporting Israel and not putting
                    more pressure on Israel to be reasonable, etc. In other words, what I call the
                    normal Arab perception.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>They were somewhat removed, but when Bourguiba took in Arafat, that brought the
                    whole issue into much closer focus. There are some who claim, and I think with
                    some reason, that the major reason Bourguiba agreed to take Arafat in—there were
                    real liabilities involved in doing so, and we saw years later what happened: the
                    attack on Arafat's headquarters with some Tunisians killed—was that his wife,
                    Wasila Bourguiba, had long-standing connections with the Palestinians. In fact,
                    she had known Arafat years before, and she felt that Tunisia should get more
                    involved in the problem. I think it was largely due to her influence that, in
                    fact, the President decided he would take this step. That's the common
                    perception, and I think there is some good evidence supporting it. Of course, it
                    was also generally perceived as well that the US government wanted Tunisia to
                    provide a safe haven for Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it difficult, because we were certainly going through
                        a change at that time? Were you there at the time the Israelis went into
                        Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because first there was strong indication that Alexander
                        Haig said: Well, you know, go ahead and do this. And Sharon had taken the
                        bit in his teeth. But then you had the complicity of the Israeli Army and
                        the Sabra and Shatila massacres of Palestinians in Lebanon. And it was the
                        beginning of a change in American attitude towards Israel. Were you having
                        problems being in the Arab world? First you have this invasion, then it went
                        really sour, the Israelis didn't do as well and the outcome wasn't as good,
                        the Marines were being killed, and a lot of stuff. How did this play in a
                        friendly Arab world, somewhat removed, but still getting involved, for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The Tunisians were terribly upset by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. A
                    little bit like Saudi Arabia, Tunisia was viewed in the area as having a very
                    close, even special, relationship with the United States. Therefore, they felt
                    doubly uncomfortable because of this perception that Tunisia and the United
                    States were very close friends. And, therefore, what we did was particularly
                    embarrassing and upsetting to them, because of their association with us.</p>
                <p>This was reflected in our Fourth of July reception, which traditionally was given
                    at the Ambassador's residence in Tunis. This was the reception of 1982, and the
                    Israelis went into Lebanon just a few weeks before that. Normally, anywhere from
                    400 to 600 people came to the Ambassador's reception. We issued the standard
                    number of invitations. Very, very few Tunisians came. And I mean a handful. It
                    was very noticeable. Everybody commented on it: What on earth has happened to
                    the Tunisians? This was a reaction to what was perceived as our support of the
                    Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It was a genuine reaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I never discovered any government instruction that went to the lower-downs
                    saying: Do not go to the American national day reception. It was an individual
                    and widespread decision that, as much as they liked the Americans, as much as
                    they may have liked the American Ambassador and his wife and all the rest, they
                    just couldn't bring themselves to go and to hear the national anthem or
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>I had very frank talks with the few Tunisians who did come, and they said, “Look,
                    this is the way it is. This is how deeply we feel about this issue.” And, boy,
                    I'll tell you, that experience just said a lot.</p>
                <p>The Tunisians, somewhat removed from the Arab-Israeli problem, at least
                    geographically, and known for their friendliness and moderation, on this
                    occasion had great, great trouble not expressing themselves in some way—and
                    that's the way they did it. Now, as I recall, a year later, it was all sort of
                    back to normal, but at that time, the impact was deep and genuine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we complete this, I would like to talk just a bit
                        more about the Arab League. There's something in the paper today (we're
                        talking about March 29, 1990) castigating the Arab League for its seeming
                        endorsement of the execution of a British journalist, and supporting Iraq in
                        some of its nastier manifestations. How did you feel about the Arab League
                        there? You say you thought that there was more room to play. What was the
                        Arab League at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The Arab League has never lived up to its potential as a political force,
                    primarily because the major Arab players have never seen fit to work through it.
                    It's a collection of everybody from very radical to very moderate, and,
                    therefore, it's very difficult to do much business with it. It was, of course,
                    without the Egyptians, and that further weakened the organization. I think the
                    feeling in Washington was that, really, this organization doesn't count for
                    much. And, in fact, that was right. It didn't count for much, certainly in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>But it was there. And, periodically, yes, it would come out with resolutions,
                    which often weren't compatible with our interests. You know, it's typical: a
                    handful of the more zealous or radical elements would push things through, and
                    nobody would dare stand up to them because that was being un-Arab. So they'd
                    come out with something that would irritate us: support of the PLO doing this or
                    that, or failure, for example, to even mildly rebuke Qadhafi, failure to come to
                    grips with the issue of terrorism. And, because of all this, I think Washington
                    decided it's just not worth bothering with. As a matter of fact, we'll show them
                    that we're not very happy about this organization and we'll keep them at arm's
                    length.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I remember some high-level visitor from Washington. I was setting up a schedule,
                    and I scheduled a meeting with the Arab League Secretary General, who was a
                    Tunisian. And there was resistance to this: My gosh, this is a bilateral visit,
                    there are enough Tunisians we want to see and so on, why do we have to bother
                    with this Arab League?</p>
                <p>I thought that we were gaining very little, and perhaps losing some, by
                    stiff-arming the Arab League. It didn't take much to at least keep in touch with
                    them and carry on a civil and, once in a while maybe, a useful dialogue. There
                    were areas where perhaps they could be helpful: terrorism was one, hostages and
                    so on. So, in those days, anyway, it was a matter of trying to convince
                    Washington that we should give them some kind of nod.</p>
                <p>Now I remember when Vice President Bush came, he did meet with the Arab League
                    Secretary General. But his staff thought, and I thought, too, that it wasn't
                    right for the Vice President of the United States to be going over to the Arab
                    League headquarters (which, incidentally, was just a temporary headquarters
                    removed from Cairo) and calling on the Secretary General. So the Secretary
                    General came and called on the Vice President at our residence. That's the way
                    we worked it out.</p>
                <p>My impression since leaving Tunisia is that, over the course of time, we have
                    found it more useful to deal with the Arab League than back in those days,
                    recognizing all the while that the Arabs themselves really prefer to deal
                    bilaterally both with each other and with us, and not go through this
                    organization. They may give a lot of public support to it and its occasional
                    resolutions, but basically it has not been used as a major vehicle for foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>Now there's one fairly recent exception, and that is Lebanon. As you perhaps
                    recall, we tried hard to do something in Lebanon, getting the Saudis and a few
                    other states involved—trying to make some sense out of the chaos in Lebanon.
                    Those efforts didn't yield much. And so, our Arab friends turned to the Arab
                    League.</p>
                <p>They set up a committee in the Arab League of four states, the Saudis were one,
                    and, actually, this committee of the Arab League made some headway and set the
                    stage for what is now known as the Taif Agreement worked out in Saudi Arabia
                    last year, which actually provided for the election of a president—something
                    that nobody had been able to achieve for some years. And we were very supportive
                    of the Arab League's involvement and efforts there.</p>
                <p>So over the course of time I think the Arab League has evolved a bit. And also,
                    of course, some of the more onerous policies of certain Arab states have been
                    moderated. Arafat himself has shifted his positions, and we now talk with the
                    PLO. So the atmosphere and the environment have changed. And now I understand
                    the Arab League will be going back to Cairo, and that may further enhance its
                    clout, if you will. But, basically, like most multilateral organizations, it is
                    used for certain functions, but is often skipped over by its member states when
                    it comes to a crunch.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're playing a role here, that a diplomat should, of
                        saying: Let's keep our options open. After all, here is an organization. And
                        so many of these organizations, you might not use them for years, and all of
                        a sudden they happen to fit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's so easy to keep the tie open. You don't have to do
                        much, except to remain civil and do the normal courtesy calls, because all
                        of a sudden you might find they're exactly what you need for a certain time.
                        As these interviews go, we're trying to pass on, also, you might say,
                        diplomatic know-how and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, that's well put, because that's exactly the way I viewed it. Why
                    alienate the Arab League? We must recognize its limitations, its shortcomings,
                    and its faults, but at the same time, why close off a channel which, at some
                    point, might be quite useful? And I think that's, in effect, what's happened
                    from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Walt, when we started these interviews, we agreed we
                        wouldn't cover Saudi Arabia. How do you feel about it? Would you like to try
                        it sometime later on, or would you rather hold off for awhile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, I think after a while. I'm still involved a little bit with the
                    country in certain ways, and I'd just as soon wait on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, very fine. Well, I want to thank you very much
                        for this, and I'm sure this will be very useful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Thank you, Stu.</p>
