                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Ambassador McManaway.]</p>
                <p>Q: Today is June 29, 1993. This is an interview with Clayton E. McManaway, Jr.
                    which is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am
                    Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you could start this off by
                    giving me a feeling of where you are coming from. Could you tell me about where
                    you were born and a bit about your background, education, etc.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was born in Greenville, South Carolina, on March 5, 1933. I went to
                    high school there in Greenville and to the University of South Carolina. I was a
                    member of the Naval ROTC and spent my obligatory two years service in the Navy.
                    In fact I was fortunate, I served one year in the Navy and one with the Marines
                    in the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major at university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: My major was business administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you serving in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I served aboard an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic in a gunnery
                    division as a line officer. Then I was a naval liaison officer with the Marines
                    in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Okinawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: In Japan and Okinawa. In fact it was the almost full year in Japan
                    that really got me interested in international affairs and influenced me in the
                    direction of doing something international and not domestic. This prompted me
                    after I got out of the Navy to go to what was then called the American Institute
                    of Foreign Trade and is now called Thunderbird, The American Graduate School of
                    International Management, in Arizona. I went there for a year for a graduate
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I finished in January, 1959. I graduated from college in 1955, two
                    years in the Service. I started in the middle of the school year and ended in
                    the middle of the school year. I was intending on a career in foreign trade. I
                    graduated during the recession of 1959 and didn't have any money and couldn't
                    get to New York which was the major hiring place. I only had enough money to get
                    to San Francisco. So I went to San Francisco and couldn't get a job. It was
                    quite an experience for about two or three months. This was long enough so I
                    didn't think it was the recession but was me. I had used up all the contacts I
                    had. Finally I accidently got a job with an insurance company and went on to a
                    couple of other jobs which finally got me to New York. I got a little involved
                    in the Kennedy campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Right. I was greatly influenced by what he seemed to represent at the
                    time. My politics have changed since then. It was shortly after his inauguration
                    and that stirring inaugural speech that I received a call from the government. I
                    had sent off the usual barrage of letters after finishing graduate school. One
                    of the people I wrote to was AID [Agency for International Development]. I got
                    several jobs later from people who originally turned me down saying they would
                    keep my application on file. I didn't believe it but it turned out to be true. I
                    got three jobs that way. This one was with AID. They had a program to bring in
                    some new blood in the executive field. I didn't know what that meant, but I took
                    it. I went down [to Washington] and stayed with the government from then on. I
                    started with AID and went to Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1961-64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I joined AID in 1961 and I was a year in Washington attending a
                    training program, but it was terrible. In fact there were seven of us and we
                    revolted and went in and complained about the program. We were a bunch of Young
                    Turks. We all, with possibly one exception, got out of the “executive” field,
                    which turned out to be administration, and went into program work, which was the
                    substantive work for AID. So we were there for a year. I had a terrible
                    experience of getting out of there.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am trying to catch the spirit of the time. What was
                        thproblem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, AID was being strongly affected by the Kennedy Administration.
                    It was being reorganized extensively and it was my first run in with government
                    personnel systems. I found out by accident that they were about to force assign
                    me to Togo without even telling me about it. So I went to Personnel and asked
                    what I could do about this. He said, “Well, you could turn it down.” I asked how
                    many times could you do that. He said, “Well, about three.” I said, “Well, I
                    turn it down.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not Togo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was of no interest to me. I wasn't interested in Togo. It didn't
                    seem like a very interesting place to be and didn't have much of a program and
                    didn't seem like a place to get started. My attention had been attracted to
                    Indochina because of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It seemed to me that was where the action was. I knew they were
                    recruiting junior people for Cambodia and I somehow got an appointment with the
                    mission director who was visiting on consultation. He offered me a job and I
                    took it. This was all outside of channels. When I went back into channels no one
                    would act on it. The people I was being trained with wouldn't back me up because
                    they didn't want to fight personnel. The personnel people who were handling
                    African assignments called me a traitor. They were vicious. I had to write up my
                    own memo to Personnel saying that I had been offered this job and I had accepted
                    it and threatened to resign. Once I wrote it down, the whole system sort of
                    collapsed and they finally gave in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a lesson, I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It certainly was, I had never dealt with government personnel people
                    before. Of course, AID was a terrible organization anyway, even in those days.
                    It seems to have gotten worse and really should be done away with in my opinion.
                    We should start over.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I finally made it out to Cambodia in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: About. I was there until Sihanouk kicked us out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job when you went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was in the program office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: In that situation I was an assistant program officer. We had a program
                    officer and a deputy and a few other assistants. We were the OMB [Office of
                    Management and Budget]. You had the technical bureaus, divisions, all pushing
                    their programs. The program office put it all together and had to ultimately
                    justify it. So the technical bureaus had to justify it to us first, so we asked
                    all the hard questions about the programs. Then we supposedly looked at the
                    overall policy, the development policy.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression and what kind of work were we trying to do? I have
                    always had a question about any of the AID projects because many of them depend
                    almost on the personalities of the people there. If you happen to have a
                    Forestry man there at the head, all of a sudden forestry is the big thing. How
                    did you find the situation?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There was the usual sort of mixed picture. When we were kicked out,
                    which is an interesting story in itself, we decided that surely there would be
                    somebody going back in and we discovered as we were getting ready to leave that
                    the files were in terrible condition. We sort of knew that anyway, but didn't
                    realize how bad they really were. So we decided we would write a history of the
                    AID program in Cambodia for the benefit of anyone involved in a renewal of an
                    AID program there and for the record. We did that in Saigon for a long time and
                    then finished it up when I went back to Washington.</p>
                <p>We discovered in the files going back to the earliest days of AID programs
                    projects that we were launching at the time almost identical in education, etc.
                    I remember being horrified to find in the files a project agreement with the
                    government of Cambodia that was almost an exact duplicate of a program we had
                    designed and were very proud of in the field of education just the year before.
                    The previous program had been done years before and nothing had ever come of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The French had refurbished a canal system that the Khmer had built back in the
                    9th and 10th centuries. We went up and refurbished that and then found out that
                    the farmers weren't using it...this showed how much we knew about the country.
                    We finally sent an anthropologist up to the lake, which is the lake that the
                    Mekong backs up into [the Tonle Sap]. We were trying to get the farmers to do
                    double cropping. Well, they were already doing it using the rise and fall of the
                    lake to do exactly what we were trying to get them to do with the irrigation. So
                    they didn't need it.</p>
                <p>There were dire predictions that everything would collapse when we left. The road
                    that we had built down to the bay would be impassible, etc. None of those things
                    happened. I didn't think much of our AID program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the political/economic situation during
                        thi1962-64 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, Sihanouk was in firm control at that time, although he had a
                    couple of [threats to his rule]. He had developed to an art this business of
                    saying that he was going to resign and then everybody would beg him not to
                    whenever he got into trouble. The incident that caused us to leave really began
                    with some very anti-American speeches that he had made. I don't remember why he
                    got on this kick, but we were having a good deal of trouble with him. Then
                    Kennedy was killed and things got worse right away. Sihanouk said some things
                    that were [out of line]. I think Averell Harriman at the UN called his
                    statements barbaric which really set him off. We got a letter from him saying
                    that he would not accept another dollar of aid from the United States and that
                    he couldn't promise police protection beyond January 13 or something like that,
                    which, of course, meant we had to get out of there. We began withdrawing
                    quickly. I was not involved in the consultations with the ambassador or between
                    the embassy and the State Department, but we had already taken a couple of
                    actions that couldn't be reversed and suddenly got a cable from Harriman saying
                    to stop everything. We got the cable, I think, on a Friday and then waited and
                    waited and didn't hear anything more. But obviously there were second thoughts
                    about the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had this hold on but I take it the process was still
                        goinforward and you were getting ready to get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, yes. We moved ahead and left on the deadline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again looking at it at that time, how were relations
                        between thAID mission and the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: They were reasonably good. The ambassador was away. Hhad had some kind
                    of ailment and was out of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Philip Sprouse. I, of course, didn't have much direct contact with him
                    being a very junior officer. I had more contact with the DCM [deputy chief of
                    mission] who was a bit of a stuffed shirt. He loved to edit out all split
                    infinitives and that sort of thing. That was his major contribution to our
                    submissions as far as I could see. So we had a charg� at the time. We had a very
                    strong deputy director in the AID mission, Peter Cody, who was a political
                    appointee. You may recall they brought in about ten business tycoons about that
                    time [as country directors] and I think they all failed. This fellow's name was
                    Champaign, I think, and he failed also. He wasn't terribly good. But we marched
                    ahead and left. I think the State Department was not happy with what we did. I
                    think they felt we had jumped the gun and we might have been able to negotiate
                    our staying which they would have preferred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards Sihanouk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We were very upset with him at the time. People were angry with him
                    and thought he had behaved very [badly]. Kennedy was well regarded and he had
                    just been assassinated and Sihanouk was making his ugly remarks about being
                    happy with the whole thing. They were terrible vitriolic anti-American speeches
                    and anti-Kennedy speeches. So nobody had any respect for him. He was a small,
                    fat fellow with a high squeaky voice. He was called snoopy. There were a lot of
                    rumors about the kinds of things that went on in the palace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to hear stories that he would go through these
                        crash dietand all hell used to break loose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He would go to France once a year to go on some kind of a special
                    regime. Then there would be trouble at home and he would come flying back and be
                    very dramatic and histrionic. There were a lot of stories about his sexual
                    promiscuity and how he would do a lot of visiting around the countryside and nod
                    to a girl in the audience and his goons would go get her for him. One hilarious
                    thing that happened was Sukarno visited and stayed about a week. The day after
                    he left the front page of the main newspaper had a marvelous photograph of these
                    young beauties lined up at the airport all being decorated for their services to
                    the state.</p>

                <p>McMANAWAY: I don't think so at that time. There was something going on. There was
                    one fellow, but I don't think it had anything to do with the Khmer Rouge, up
                    around who was a rival of Sihanouk's. But there was nothing like a Pol Pot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, for a while..</p>
                <p>Q: This was shortly after the death of Diem in October 1963 and you had the
                    October coup and the beginning of the revolving governments and military groups.
                    Were you getting any feel for how the people felt about the situation.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We were very isolated there. We were tucked away in one corner of the
                    AID mission and AID missions are pretty well isolated from what is going on at
                    the embassy. So we were even further away from that and pretty much stuck to
                    ourselves. We could sense that there was a good deal of frustration about what
                    was going on and a lot of impatience with these repeated coups and
                    demi-coups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I don't remember whether we were there for six months. We had what was
                    then called the commodity import program going on in Cambodia when we shut it
                    down. The commodity import program was easy to run but very complicated to shut
                    down because you had orders all over the place and you had goods and things [in
                    ships] on the high seas and didn't know where they were. There was no system for
                    tracking those things. We were trying to turn ships around and it took a long
                    time to shut the thing down and finally close out the books. I made several
                    trips back over to Phnom Penh. I was there when the embassy was stoned which was
                    another interesting experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was an organized demonstration which turned violent. No one was
                    hurt, everybody was inside. I just barely made it inside before everything
                    erupted. Some cars were turned over and burned, they threw stones through
                    windows and things like that. There was one rickety old elevator in the embassy
                    which was the old French kind being open except for an accordion type metal
                    door. I had gone up to the top floor so that I could see better what was going
                    on. Then word came for everybody to congregate on the second floor. I got in
                    this elevator and you couldn't stop it. It came down [to the main floor] and
                    right in front of the elevator was a window. Well, I hid there. There were three
                    or four Cambodian fellows outside tearing up a car and they saw me and started
                    throwing things in an attempt to hit me. They didn't succeed but did get things
                    into the elevator. They finally got in on the first floor but the Marines
                    blocked up entrances and they couldn't get any further. It was over after a few
                    hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, and was assigned to the Vietnam Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Vietnam Desk was this State Department or
                        AID? McMANAWAY: It was AID.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID's Vietnam program looking
                        at ifrom its headquarters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: My impression was that it was largely a logistics operation, moving
                    things out to Vietnam. And it was obviously growing by leaps and bounds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just before we started to really get
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. The fellow who was just above the Desk Officer, whose name was
                    Stoneman, I think, was a good logistician, but that basically was all he
                    understood. So I couldn't see much coherence in what we were doing. Later on,
                    once I went out to Vietnam, I was one of the leaders that finally got us away
                    from this awful business of winning the hearts and minds of...of this terribly
                    naive notion that you can build a school or hospital and win the hearts and...I
                    hate that phrase to this day because it really kept us from really realizing
                    what was at stake there for quite a long time and I think really lost the war
                    for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>We finally developed the pacification program, which I became involved in, both
                    from within AID and then later when we went through the two reorganizations when
                    Komer came out and got the civilians organized so we could put it into the
                    military organization. It took us a long time to turn around from this thinking
                    and realize that what we had to do was to provide people with a stake in the
                    society and economy and local community that they wanted to protect. A stake
                    that was important to them, not winning their hearts and minds which was
                    nonsense.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say winning hearts and minds, how does one win hearts and minds in
                    the mind-set of the 1960s when you were back in Washington?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The theory was that you gave them better seeds for their plantings,
                    better schools, better medical services, etc. This would, without regard to what
                    was threatening them, somehow gain you their allegiance. Instead of starting
                    with the notion that what you have to do is develop first of all local security
                    and then they need to have a stake politically in their local government. And
                    they need to have an economic stake. You do that by connecting them up with
                    markets and with roads, etc. So, it took us a long time, but we finally got it
                    turned around. Actually, one of the things you will find out later is that I
                    think we won the war and that is why the [Viet Cong] ultimately faded away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mainline armies...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Turned over everything they had. But we won the guerilla war finally.
                    It took us a lot longer because we didn't understand it. West Point never
                    understood it, Abrams did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was also helped by the Tet offensive which knocked
                        the helout of the Viet Cong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, decimated it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you volunteer to go back to CORDS [Civil Operations

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, CORDS didn't exist when I went back. I was asked by a fellow who
                    I had a lot of respect for, Roy Wehrle, who was a real star in AID at the time.
                    He was a young man rising...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he still around?</hi>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, he years ago went back to academia out in Illinois. Everything was
                    inflated in Vietnam in terms of titles. The mission was huge by this time. He
                    was the assistant director for plans and something or other. He was number three
                    in the mission. He was back on consultation and asked me to come out and join
                    his program office and deal with local finance and currency matters,
                    classification, etc. And I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main things you were working on at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was working on pacification. We were torn with a lot of different
                    ideas about how to bring security to the countryside and how to win the hearts
                    and minds. One of the things we were looking at was how could you bypass the
                    province chiefs and get straight to the village chief with money for self-help
                    projects, that is what we called them then.</p>
                <p>I set up a special fund which was jointly administered. It was financed from
                    counterpart funds and required sign-off by the U.S. ambassador and the [South
                    Vietnamese] Prime Minister. I designed this thing and worked it all the way
                    through the bureaucracy and sent the letter over to the embassy to go to the
                    ambassador. Peter Tarnoff was the ambassador's special assistant. I got a call
                    from Peter and he said, “Did you write this?” And I said, “Yes.” It was about a
                    three page letter, I was still learning how to write. He said, “The Ambassador
                    wanted to meet whoever wrote this and you are not to tell anybody. Don't tell
                    Charles Mann.” The ambassador was Lodge and he couldn't stand Charles Mann, who
                    was the director. Charles Mann was an Austrian who had worked his way up from
                    being a clerk in Paris after the war in the original aid program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before the original Marshall Plan, ICA
                        [InternationaCooperation Agency] or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He had worked his all the way up to be a mission director. But Lodge
                    couldn't understand him and wasn't about to acknowledge to Mann that he couldn't
                    understand this letter. I was pretty scared. Here I was still a junior officer
                    going over to meet the ambassador alone without telling the director. So I went
                    over there and it was a fascinating experience. I sat in front of Lodge's desk
                    and he said, “Who wrote this awful thing?” I said, “I did.” He said, “Well, tell
                    me what you are trying to say.” And I told him. He said, “All right, you let me
                    know if I say this wrong.” He reached behind him and got his dictaphone and
                    dictated a one page letter which was just beautiful. He said everything I had
                    tried to say. I learned an awful lot from that few minutes. Lodge had a lot of
                    faults but not being able to write was not one of them. Anyway, it went off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any input from the field about your
                        attempts tget down to the village chief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, we got some. We would have meetings with people from the field.
                    But at that time, and one of the reasons we finally had to reorganize, we had
                    too many people in the field, too many agencies had people in the field. Later
                    on when we were looking at how we should reorganize, I drew up an overhead slide
                    thing which showed all these lines going out from Saigon to the field and it was
                    a nightmare. That was when initially the Office of Civil Operations was set up,
                    which got all the civilian agencies together under one chain of command. And
                    then Komer moved it into MACV [Military Assistance Command, Vietnam] and that is
                    when it became CORDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at the AID office as a fairly junior officer,
                        what was their impression of Lodge and his direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There again, we were pretty well occupied with what we were doing. We
                    thought Lodge was sort of a lazy guy, not very energetic. One had this sense of
                    sort of a caretaker approach to things. Not a lot of initiative coming from him.
                    But I was beginning to rise up by then. I was promoted fairly rapidly in Vietnam
                    because they had temporary promotions which was one of the incentives to get
                    people there. Increasingly I was asked to take on more and more responsibility
                    and I negotiated my way up. I said, “Well, if you are going to give me all this
                    responsibility...” I reached the FS-01 pay grade, which in those days was as
                    high as you could go when I was 35 or 36. I was negotiating with the Vietnamese
                    budget office on how the local currency was to be used, the entire budget.
                    Later, when I moved over to CORDS we succeeded in taking all that money away
                    from AID. That was one of the reasons I was no longer very popular in AID. We
                    took all the local currency away from AID and put it into the pacification
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Vietnamese bureaucracy at
                        thitime?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: You really had to push them to be responsive to the people of the
                    countryside. You basically had Saigon and the rest of Vietnam, which is not
                    uncommon. In terms of their competence, the Vietnamese are very competent people
                    and very bright. I always thought they were too bright for their own good. They
                    were complicated people. My counterpart, who wasn't really my counterpart, I was
                    dealing over my head with this fellow at the budget office, was highly capable
                    and knowledgeable, but had been there too long. He had been doing the same job
                    for much too long and was quite rigid and you really had to fight with him to
                    get any change. In fact I think he opposed this submission that I finally got
                    through.</p>
                <p>Q: Was part of the reason for the initiative that the feeling was that if you
                    didn't have a proscribed procedure to get funds down to the village chief they
                    would be sidetracked by the district and province people?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, they would never get there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for the role in the CIA there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was probably was pretty naive about it at that point in my career. I
                    didn't know much about it. It was a huge mission and a big joke because they all
                    drove Toyotas. Some procurement officer went out and got the low bid and bought
                    all the same car.</p>
                <p>Q: And they all had Hmong guards in front of their place, who were a distinctive
                    racial type so if you saw these guards in front of a house you knew it was
                    CIA.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I didn't know very much about what they were doing. We were working
                    extremely long hours and didn't have time to sit around and ponder what other
                    people were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Office of Civil Operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: This developed out of a meeting that took place, I believe in Hawaii,
                    [President] Johnson had with Westmoreland. Komer had been coming out on visits
                    and I had met him. It was decided to send Komer to Saigon. He was a very
                    forceful man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was known as the blowtorch or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Johnson had decided to send him out there to get the pacification
                    program going and told Komer that he and Westmoreland was to work it out. So
                    Komer, I think very wisely, realized that he first had to get the civilians
                    organized, which became the Office of Civil Operations and very shortly after
                    that it was moved in as an integral part of MACV and Komer became a deputy to
                    Westmoreland. We worked right through the military organization. Our head was
                    assistant chief of staff for CORDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did AID take this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were sizeable chunks of the AID organization being taken
                        out anput into CORDS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: In Saigon they were being taken out and the chain of command was
                    shifted so that the AID people in the field were reporting back not to the AID
                    mission in Saigon but the Office of Civil Operation. Komer asked me to come over
                    with it and I headed up the plans and program office. No one else wanted to do
                    it. A lot of AID people were afraid to do this. They saw this as
                    something...which I think in the end they were right...a lot of people in AID
                    suffered for having served in Vietnam, which was an outrage later on, several
                    years later. I would have, too, but I left. I think I definitely would have
                    because all they were going to offer me was to run the Vietnamese Desk when I
                    got back. I wasn't about to do that. I got an offer from the Defense Department
                    and left AID.</p>
                <p>I went over and convinced some people who had been working with me to come with
                    me. Others didn't. Some refused, it was not a requirement. It was not a large
                    office at the beginning, but it was the beginning of this shift of command of
                    all these people in the field. Ultimately we had people down to the district
                    level. When we moved into MACV we integrated everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MACV stood for Military Assistance Command Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We moved right in and became an integral part. The interesting thing
                    about that was once we got inside the elephant we never lost another policy
                    fight. We couldn't win one on the outside. We argued, for example, over how many
                    popular forces there should be, how many regional forces there should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were basically small militia groups at the lower
                        levels.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: In theory and principle the popular forces were to be under the
                    village chief's command and the regional forces under the district chief's
                    command or in some cases province chief. These are not the full army units. And
                    we couldn't get any attention to this from the U.S. military. The U.S. military,
                    of course, were the ones who were negotiating with the Vietnamese on force
                    levels and that sort of thing. So we couldn't get an increase. Once we got in,
                    of course Tet had an influence on this, too, a lot of things happened that year
                    of a very positive nature. They mobilized, for one thing. I think the first time
                    the Vietnamese mobilized was after the Tet offensive. They didn't have a
                    government which had the political strength to do it before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tet was in January, 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There were three offensives. There was one in February, one in May and
                    one in August. Each one of descending violence. But once we because a part of
                    MACV and were able to put our points forward in their system, I don't think we
                    ever lost another policy decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the coordination with the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, CORDS was a combined civil/military organization. Q: Did you
                    have military officers assigned to CORDS?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, I had a colonel for a deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? Were there differences in
                        viewpoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There were differences but it worked quite well. I was in charge of
                    plans and programs and evaluations. I had a colonel under me. Our top guy who
                    reported technically through the chief of staff to Komer was a civilian and his
                    deputy was a brigadier general. We sort of layered it that way throughout the
                    organization and it worked quite well.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the reports you were getting from the field? Let's
                    say pre-Tet. Was this part of your responsibility to get reports and get an idea
                    of how things were happening?</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was not my responsibility but I used them, of course. We had an
                    evaluation unit that went out. Craig Johnstone headed it up. Our impression was
                    that there were a lot more Viet Cong out there than the military was reporting
                    and that Westmoreland wanted to believe. But we were just as surprised by Tet as
                    anyone else. We were not unaware of the weaknesses of the reporting system and
                    that is why we had this evaluation unit to travel all over the country. And I
                    traveled all over the country. And traveled even more after Tet. Before Tet we
                    didn't have a counterpart organization on the Vietnamese side. It was only after
                    Tet that we got them set up as a counterpart organization. Before Tet we would
                    send out instructions to our province advisor and he would go over to the
                    province chief who hadn't heard anything from Saigon, so it was like going up
                    against a brick wall. After Tet when we got the counterpart organization set up,
                    we would parallel these instructions working them out in Saigon first and then
                    the instructions went out so that everybody got the same instructions. Then
                    after Tet we got the first pacification annual plan which grew out of an
                    accelerated pacification campaign that we launched in late summer or early fall
                    that year. John Vann was very much opposed to that plan. It was one of the few
                    times that John and I had a big argument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of John Vann, he being one of the
                        majofigures in our efforts in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: John was extremely capable, a tremendous leader. His private life was
                    somewhat spectacular also. But I was never a moral moralist, that was his
                    business and not mine. He was driven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he viewed within CORDS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He was one of the heavies. He was never in Saigon, hwas always out in
                    the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Tet hit you personally? Do you have any Tet
                        stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, I was here on leave and was called back. One story...I was
                    getting ready to go back and I got a cable from Komer calling me back. I was
                    sitting in home of some friends of mine in New York watching television and the
                    news came on and there was my good friend George Jacobson leaning out the window
                    of the embassy. Someone is trying to throw him a pistol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I came right out of my chair.</p>
                <p>I jumped on a plane and flew back and got to the airport which had taken a direct
                    hit on the building. There was no one there. It was just empty. There was no one
                    there to unload the bags. We finally found somebody to open up the cargo area so
                    we could get our luggage. We carried our own bags. Luckily MACV was right across
                    the street so I was able to get over there. I was walking down the road with my
                    bag and along comes my deputy in my car. It turned out my driver had disappeared
                    and never showed up again. That was my entry back. It was still going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are back and the offensive is still active in various
                        places,how is this affecting the CORDS program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think there were about 35 cities in the country which were hit or
                    overrun. Initially we pulled in our horns but in Saigon I ended up with three
                    jobs. We set up a recovery organization which I headed for Komer, working
                    directly with the prime minister's office. The guy who headed that up was
                    Colonel Que and he, after a few months, became mayor of Saigon. In fact, we made
                    him mayor of Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because you felt here is somebody who can do the
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He was a very capable guy, strong and forceful. Saigon was desperate
                    for leadership. He asked for me as his advisor. So I was doing the pacification
                    planning programming job, the recovery job, and was the advisor to the mayor of
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Recovery was recovery from the Tet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. One day Bob Komer called me and Bob Montesque, General Montesque,
                    into his office and said, “There is nobody out there. The Viet Cong are not out
                    there. What we need is a pacification offensive.” “What the hell is a
                    pacification offensive?” “Go figure it out.” Pacification is defensive by its
                    very concept. After three or four days we came up with an accelerated
                    pacification campaign. And it worked. We targeted where we wanted to send forces
                    in every province. It was all mapped out. John Vann objected, he thought we were
                    overextending ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having more Americans go out in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, that got them out. What we needed was something to kick both the
                    Americans and the Vietnamese in the backside and get them moving out of the
                    provincial capitals.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think this would always be a problem because it was more comfortable
                    in the capital, it was more dangerous in the countryside and there was always
                    the paperwork which ties you down. Was this a problem trying to get people out
                    without tying them down to bureaucratic burdens?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The bureaucratic functions weren't really that much of a concern. It
                    was getting both Americans and Vietnamese out of the bunkers and back out into
                    the countryside and in the process convincing them that in fact there was no one
                    out there, and there wasn't. It was a big success and we built on that and used
                    that as the model for the annual pacification plan which came the next year.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point? I want to put something on the tape so we
                    will know where to start next time. I would like to ask you about the Phoenix
                    program; your impression of Westmoreland, Abrams, Bunker and how the embassy
                    worked; also were you getting at this point any reflections of the operation of
                    the CIA in their work; talking about the post-Tet period.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Fine.</p>
                <p>***Q: Today is September 14, 1993. You mentioned last time that you wanted to
                    talk about the RD [Rural Development] Cadre program. What was that?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: That was a program run originally by the CIA. It was a concept which
                    ultimately proved ineffective. The concept was that you would take trained
                    Vietnamese, teams trained in various specific projects and disciplines...health,
                    education, security, etc... and send them into VC [Viet Cong] controlled areas,
                    into the hamlets where they would dispose of the VC and provide a form of
                    government and then move on. The fallacy in the concept was that they did move
                    on, didn't stay. Of course once they left the VC came back and anybody who had
                    cooperated with them in the meantime was singled out by the VC for abuse. This
                    was part of our learning process in Vietnam. I can recall and still work myself
                    up into a bit of a lather over this phrase “winning the minds and hearts” of the
                    people, which was a stupid idea. It took a long time to get away from that
                    concept. A lot of it came out of AID and their notion of nation building.</p>

                <p>McMANAWAY: It is very American. But the idea that you can go in and build a
                    health clinic which then doesn't get stocked with supplies on a continuous basis
                    is nonsense. It took us a long time to get away from that. It took us until
                    1967-68 to start getting away from that idea and getting into the idea that what
                    we needed to do was to build a political, economic, and social structure in
                    which the local people had a stake and wanted to protect. After Tet we were able
                    to persuade first the U.S. military and then the South Vietnamese military, that
                    local forces were important. We got a huge increase in the local forces which
                    were called popular forces which were at least theoretically under the control
                    of the local chief. So you had permanent security in these areas, not
                    transitory. That made a big difference and was one of the major turning points.
                    It was also a reflection of our beginning to understand the war.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there during the period when people were beginning to understand
                    this. Was it first sort of a theoretical thing, with people saying this sounds
                    good and then trying it out, or were there hard minded people as opposed to
                    people who were sort of warm and loving and thought this would do it? How did
                    this work out?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: You had several things going on at the same time. At the highest level
                    you had President Johnson appointing Bob Komer as his man on pacification...we
                    never did come up with a better name for it than that. At a meeting with
                    Westmoreland, I think in Hawaii in 1966 or 1967, he assigned Komer to Vietnam
                    and told Bob and Westmoreland to work out the relationship. Komer was to be in
                    charge of pacification as a deputy to Westmoreland. Komer was a brilliant
                    bureaucrat, in the best sense of that word. He saw right away [what to do]. What
                    had happened prior to that is that we had a proliferation of civilian agencies
                    in Vietnam, each with its own line of command out to people in the provinces
                    where their people were stationed. I once drew up a briefing chart which showed
                    all the lines out going out to the provinces from Saigon which was a nightmare.
                    There was no coordination. The civilians were not working together. So Bob
                    decided first to get the civilians organized and he established the Office of
                    Civil Operations. He pulled segments out of AID, USIA [United States Information
                    Agency] and other civilian agencies that were there, and put them all together
                    in this outfit which we pronounced OCO. Once he had accomplished that he moved
                    it into MACV, into the military structure, which was his goal all along. The
                    civilians were no match for the military in terms of staffing and bureaucratic
                    struggles for winning any policy issues until we got into MACV. One of the most
                    miraculous things to me was that once we got into MACV we never lost a policy
                    fight. We were inside the elephant and able to do quite a number of
                    revolutionary things. One of them was to get this terrific increase in popular
                    forces. We got across various aspects like permanent security and redoing
                    village structure through elections, etc.</p>
                <p>Then Tet came along which was a tremendous defeat for the North Vietnamese and
                    the Viet Cong, although obviously not perceived that way. But it was. There were
                    three Tet offensives, one in February, one in May and one later on, I think, in
                    August.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We were getting away from the RD Cadre at that point and moving towards using the
                    regional forces and restructuring the village and using the more sophisticated
                    concept of what pacification needs to be about. Now the accelerated pacification
                    campaign was a big success. Komer was right, the Viet Cong were not out there.
                    We and the Vietnamese were all hunkered down and there was nobody out there. We
                    brought security to about 3 million people in about 3 months. That led then to
                    the first national pacification plan where we brought all of the programs
                    together, got it written up and translated into Vietnamese, sent out and got
                    them organized.</p>
                <p>When I went to Harvard after Vietnam, 1971, I was going to write a book about the
                    year of the monkey, 1968, the year of Tet, because so many firsts happened that
                    year. The South Vietnamese were mobilized for the first time, which meant we
                    could get more forces. We got them to organize themselves in a way that we could
                    relate to them both in Saigon and at the CORDS level, the province level, the
                    district level, which is as far as we went, we didn't go down to the village
                    level in our position, so that we were no longer sending out orders to our
                    people that were not be paralleled by the Vietnamese. We had quite good success.
                    As I may have told you in the last interview, I am one of those who believe we
                    won the guerilla war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Westmoreland and Abrams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Westmoreland, in my view, never understood the war. We used to call
                    him instant image, with that granite jaw appearance. He is a fine man but he
                    never understood this war and I don't think he understands it today. Abrams
                    understood it. If we could have had Abrams there from the beginning, the war
                    would have turned out differently. It was fascinating watching Abrams bring his
                    co-commanders around to support pacification. We actually got into the military
                    plan the objective and strategy for supporting pacification under Abrams. He
                    understood it, Westmoreland did not. I don't think Westmoreland read anything.
                    If you didn't brief him he didn't know. Westmoreland was a logistician of some
                    genius, I suppose, but he didn't understand the guerilla war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Ellsworth Bunker, our ambassador, did you have a
                        chancto see how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He was a master, one of the finest men I have ever known. I did not
                    have the honor of working closely daily with him. I saw him only a few times at
                    country team meetings that I would attend for some specific purpose. He
                    understood the war and what was going on. I have nothing but admiration for
                    Bunker.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the embassy which was very large? How did you feel
                    it did in reporting the situation and dealing with the host government, two of
                    the important things an embassy does?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, we were almost a separate operation. We were so big and had so
                    much money, so many forces, and so many people in the organization...there must
                    have been 6000 people in the CORDS section...that we didn't pay much attention
                    to the embassy. When I first got there Arch Calhoun was political counselor and
                    then Phil Habib came along. We would hear from Phil occasionally - he would come
                    and brief us on what was going on. We were interested in those things but we
                    were totally absorbed in our work in the field. Even our contacts with the
                    Vietnamese government were separate [from the embassy]. Now Komer, of course,
                    attended country team meetings, and Colby after him...and he worked much more
                    closely with Bunker. The rest of us in the CORDS organization were totally
                    absorbed in what we were doing.</p>
                <p>Q: It seems to me that one of the major reasons for the eventual defeat of the
                    South Vietnamese was essentially the corruption and the narrowness of its ruling
                    group. How were you dealing with this?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We had special reporting on province chiefs. We didn't get much
                    involved in the national politics. Komer might have, but the rest of us didn't,
                    although we had periodic meetings with President Thieu. He established a council
                    which we attended. But, again, we talked there about the pacification program,
                    about the war, not about national politics. But we had reporting on corrupt
                    province chiefs and we got them changed. We had a very aggressive stance with
                    the Vietnamese. We were right in there all the time. Komer used to call me up
                    and tell me to go tell the prime minister who he wanted fired. We would go over
                    with lists of province chiefs that we wanted changed and they would be
                    changed.</p>
                <p>Q: I have been interviewing Terry McNamara who was up in Da Nang and he talked
                    about the I Corp commander of the Vietnamese who had quite a reputation for his
                    involvement in all sorts of nefarious things. Would that have been too high to
                    get at?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, probably too high to deal with. Although we did have a very
                    aggressive posture with corruption. I was not one of those who believe that is
                    the reason they lost the war. I think they lost the war because the North
                    Vietnamese had a better army in the end and the South Vietnamese didn't have our
                    support any more. The first invasion came in 1972 and we provided air support
                    which enabled them to fend it off. Between 1972-75 we began cutting back funds
                    for the South Vietnamese army. By this time I was in the Defense Department and
                    was following it for the Secretary of Defense, Mel Laird. I was on his little
                    group of Vietnamization program. I was seeing reports and doing analysis. The
                    South Vietnamese army no longer had enough ammunition to train. Funds had been
                    cut back so deeply that they were not able to allocate ammunition for training
                    purposes. When the invasion came by the entire North Vietnamese army, they
                    didn't have our air support.</p>

                        quite bit since they had their own programs going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Basically what happened was that they pulled out of the RD Cadre
                    program. This was somewhere around 1968-69. It was after Komer left because I
                    remember I was in the office with Bill Colby who had taken over from Komer, when
                    he got the call from Ted Shackley, who was the station chief, informing Bill
                    that they were withdrawing the funding support for the RD Cadre program. They
                    provided intelligence. They worked with South Vietnamese intelligence. But
                    except for that one occasion, we really didn't bump into each other that often
                    that I was aware of. They worked more with the South Vietnamese and strictly
                    intelligence groups and we didn't have that much trouble or involvement with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Phoenix program going at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The Phoenix was one of the eight or nine programs
                    withipacification.</p>
                <p>Q: This is the one that got a lot of publicity and all. My understanding was, and
                    this is really from hearsay, that it was designed to root out the Viet Cong
                    cadre and all.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was designed to go after the Viet Cong leadership and there were
                    several mistakes made with it in how it was described. I remember Bill Komer was
                    called back to appear before Fulbright for a week of hearings and we brought
                    back a whole team. I came with him and did most of the preparation for the
                    hearings in terms of preparing the testimony, the backup and the questions and
                    answers, etc. I sat through the whole thing but didn't say very much. At one
                    point I realized what we were doing. We were getting a lot of tough questions
                    about the Phoenix program and we had described the program as designed to root
                    out the political leadership of the Viet Cong. I remember passing Bill a note
                    saying that we had made a terrible mistake because we were sitting talking to
                    politicians and they probably thought we were talking about legitimate
                    politicians. We weren't, of course, we were talking about the secret command
                    that controlled the organization of the Viet Cong.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In our terms we were very successful in those hearings because, as Bill put it,
                    we stayed back with the trust ads, Fulbright didn't get the headlines that he
                    wanted. However, there was one night that on national television Walter
                    Cronkite, and I have never had any respect for him since, picked up a very sharp
                    exchange that occurred between Senator Gore and Bill about the Phoenix program.
                    Gore had said, “Now you are telling me that it is not an assassination program?”
                    And Bill said, “It is not.” Well, that little clip was shown on TV that night
                    followed by a clip of some rather brutal treatment of some elderly Vietnamese
                    gentleman...he was being given the water treatment by Vietnamese soldiers and
                    this was described as being the Phoenix by Walter Cronkite. The analyst who
                    looked at the film clip for us said that it was made up of about ten different
                    incidents that they had pieced together to make up this story for Cronkite to
                    use.</p>
                <p>It was not an assassination program, which was the misconception of it. The only
                    mistake we made was that we gave people quotas. That was really a mistake. I
                    remember George Jacobson being very much opposed to that. He perceived rightly
                    how it would seem when it got out. It was intended as a management goal, a way
                    to measure progress. I never thought the Phoenix program worked very well. It
                    was not designed as an assassination program. It was designed to identify, track
                    down and get at the tax collector and the local secret command in control of the
                    network of the Viet Cong. Not necessarily to kill them but to arrest them, to
                    get them out of the picture. What usually happened was that you would get
                    intelligence...this was also supposed to bring together a lot of the different
                    intelligence...about a tax collector or a local commander who was going to be
                    traveling from this village to that village and you would use those popular
                    forces to lay an ambush. More often than not, and I looked at the statistics at
                    how the people who were part of the Viet Cong cadre, the leaders, were actually
                    killed. They were killed in combat not as a result of assassination teams or a
                    deliberate operation aimed at them. So by the time I left in 1970, I thought we
                    had put so many popular forces out into the countryside that we had pretty well
                    suffocated the Viet Cong structure and the Phoenix program was no longer needed.
                    One of my last recommendations before I left was to disband it.</p>

                    guess, started out as the Kissinger Seminar. I had intended to write a book
                    about the Tet offensive, but the atmosphere was such that I dropped the idea
                    immediately. There was no audience whatsoever that wasn't stridently opposed. I
                    found the atmosphere at Harvard to be quite unreceptive to any objective view of
                    Vietnam.</p>

                        seemeto have all have made up their minds and were closed to listening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, yes, they were completely closed. The thing that upset me the most
                    was watching the professors trying to outdo the students or to curry the favor
                    of the students. I found it absolutely disgusting. Over and over I saw them
                    trying to get out in front of the students in terms of their anti-Vietnam
                    attitudes in order to curry favor with the students.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yale was of the same ilk, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The spring semester before I went there, a bomb was set off at the
                    Center for International Affairs by anti-Vietnam protestors. We didn't have
                    anything like that when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to pursue any studies while you were

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The arrangement there is that you have faculty status so you don't get
                    any credit there for any academic work you do, but you are free to audit
                    whatever you want. They only ask that you write a paper. I decided to write a
                    paper on how to end the Vietnam war. An amusing little side story...I wrote a
                    paper that said that it was really useless trying to deal with the Russians on
                    this, that we needed to deal with China and that the President should visit
                    China in order to deal with this and then we could deal with the Soviets. You
                    have to defend your paper and I was hooted out of the room. I brought it back
                    down to Washington with me when I came back to work and took it to a friend of
                    mine over at the White House and gave it to him. I got it back with a little
                    note saying, “Very interesting.” A few months later the opening to China was
                    announced by the Nixon Administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Harvard in 1971, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I had received an offer to go to the Defense Department. One of the
                    things that had happened while I was in Vietnam was that I was put into a
                    position of competing with AID, my parent agency at the time, for resources and
                    we usually won. I really took over all of the local currency and got it put into
                    the pacification program. I was not really very popular with AID and they were
                    not offering me very much in the way of assignments. The best they could come up
                    with was to work on the Vietnam Desk, so I said thank you very much I had had
                    enough of that. Meanwhile I had gotten an offer to go to the Defense Department
                    as a deputy assistant secretary in systems analysis. I said, “You have the wrong
                    guy because you show me a mathematical formula and my eyes glaze over.” They
                    said, “Well, that is not what we want. We want you for a particular job called
                    deputy assistant secretary for regional programs, dealing with foreign policy
                    matters and work with the ISA.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the International Security Affairs, which is the
                        foreigpolicy arm of the Pentagon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, it's their State Department. So I resigned from AID and moved
                    over to the Defense Department. That is where I met Larry Eagleburger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Larry was running ISA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Not exactly, he was the deputy assistant secretary, not the assistant
                    secretary. We worked on a number of things together. We worked on the Mutual and
                    Balanced Force Reduction [MBFR] doing the original papers. In fact some of the
                    stuff that we worked on MBFR in Europe they were still using ten years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view at that time from the Pentagon of MBFR?
                        Dithey look upon this as a good thing or pie in the sky?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think it was viewed...except for the Deputy Secretary [of
                    Defense]...we had done a lot of work on this when he came in and he announced at
                    the meeting Larry and I had with him and some others, that there was not going
                    to be any MBFR. He got that straight from Nixon. Well, for a while we didn't
                    know what to do. We finally got back on track. And then he left, he didn't stay
                    there very long, it was viewed reasonably well. It was viewed, I think, as a
                    long shot, but worth doing. We also did a lot of work under Schlesinger, when he
                    came in as Secretary, on the balance of forces in Europe...what it was and how
                    capable our forces and our allies of standing up to a Russian attack. I once
                    took materials which proved that NATO could hold that would take you two days to
                    go over in detail and condensed it to a two-hour briefing for NATO ministers,
                    which we gave at Camp David with Schlesinger in the chair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this under Nixon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. The whole purpose was to encourage the NATO allies to continue to
                    allocate adequate resources to defense, because there was sort of a pessimistic
                    air at the time that Russian forces had been built up so greatly that NATO
                    couldn't hold. The work we did showed that NATO could hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this without nuclear force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, using conventional means.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the prevailing view, you were there from 1971-73,
                        of thSoviet threat? Was it something that could happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, I think so, it was something that could happen. I think that was
                    tempered somewhat by the fact that the Soviets had not done anything when we
                    bombed North Vietnam. I recall Larry Eagleburger coming back from [overseas]. He
                    was working on the treaty that we finally signed with the Soviets about
                    operations at sea. He went to Moscow and came back saying, “I am not sure those
                    missiles will work.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that we are in the post-Soviet period we wonder if
                        wexaggerated the Soviet capabilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We probably did.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression about working in the Pentagon? How did they see the
                    world? Was it a different view than seen by AID and the State Department?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, yes, of course, it was a different view. You were working on much
                    bigger policy questions than I had been before. But I was still working on
                    Vietnamization. I wrote a paper trying to keep us out of Cambodia, which didn't
                    succeed. I am not quite sure what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>Q: I am just wondering whether the military saw things differently. While we
                    would be looking for arrangements, would the military be looking and preparing
                    for the war?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, there is always that. I was opposed to the situation in Cambodia
                    but wasn't able to prevail. The military's program of assistance to the
                    Cambodian army was to build them another American army which would be totally
                    out of place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of these pictures with these slight Cambodians in
                        ouhuge American helmets and our rifles sort of staggering around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: So there is certainly a mind set there that is very hard to deal with
                    and change. There are not many in the military like Abrams who understands these
                    things.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were working on the Vietnamization, which was essentially turning
                    everything over to Vietnam, did you feel at the time that this was a viable
                    program or were you always looking over your shoulder at Congress and realizing
                    that our mandate had run out?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The Vietnamization program was proceeding quite well. I wrote the
                    withdrawal memos. I never saw the finals, they were kept in great secrecy.
                    Although I had prepared the analysis and response to Abrams' proposals and for
                    each withdrawal that went over to the White House from Laird. I can't remember
                    the year, but Thieu sent a delegation to Washington seeking more aid and it was
                    not received anywhere. They went home empty handed. I think that was when I
                    realized the jig was up. They were going to make it on their own or they weren't
                    going to make it, and it was highly unlikely that they were going to make it on
                    their own, certainly if the North did what it ultimately did, come across the
                    border with its full forces. The Congress had just cut it off. Ford went up with
                    a supplemental and didn't get it. I saw the handwriting on the wall at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we beginning to look at a post-Vietnam period where South Vietnam would
                    fall to the North Vietnamese and what that would mean as a military
                    situation?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: By then I had concluded that our going in there had been a mistake. I
                    am one of those who believe we never should have gone in there. On the other
                    hand once we were in there we should have won it and never allowed ourselves to
                    be defeated. I don't think we understood the history of the region enough to
                    realize [how to conduct the war]. The whole containment policy goes all the way
                    back to the idea that communism was monolithic and the Chinese [were strong
                    supporters of the North]. Well, the Chinese didn't want anything to do with
                    Vietnam. The Chinese were not expanding at all at that time. If we had done a
                    little [research into] history we would have realized that the Vietnamese and
                    the Chinese fought each other throughout the centuries and that Vietnam had been
                    divided about where the DMZ was back in the 16th century or something. So there
                    was an awful lot of history that could have been instructive had people paid
                    attention to it. But we were fixed on the idea that we had to draw a line
                    somewhere. Put it back into the context of Berlin and all of those things that
                    were going on in the world. There is an apocryphal story that Kennedy was going
                    to change our policy when he returned from Dallas. You probably heard that
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I have no idea whether it is true or not. I was also by then quite
                    disillusioned with the whole idea of limited warfare, which I think is an
                    academic concept that doesn't work. I was also disillusioned with the way we had
                    conducted ourselves, and it is still something that irritates the hell out of me
                    when I see it still today, we still have this misconception, of proportional
                    response. Well, that is absolute nonsense when we are fighting a war or doing
                    anything using violence. What you want is a disproportional response. The net
                    result of Vietnam was that we were constantly behind the curve and we were
                    letting them dictate what was going to happen next. We read and heard reports
                    after the bombing of Hanoi had stopped, that if we had kept it up a little bit
                    longer they might have crumbled. European diplomats in Hanoi at the time were
                    saying that. Of course we didn't do it. Why we fought that war the way we did
                    [is a tragedy]. The concept of limited warfare goes back to Korea. There are
                    some good books that I have read subsequently which say that is the beginning of
                    this whole idea, which is an oxymoron as far as I am concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Bill Colby became Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and he
                    was the first director to take seriously a memorandum from the President,
                    President Nixon directing the director of the CIA to be the director of central
                    intelligence [DCI] and to wear two hats. One, to run the CIA and the other to
                    coordinate the rest of the government's intelligence community. So Bill set up a
                    staff called the Intelligence Community Staff. Prior to that I think Helms
                    decided that since many of the resources were in the Defense Department, he
                    wasn't going to go up against Bill Laird, and probably wisely. But Bill was
                    determined to carry out that mandate. He asked me to be on the Staff. I did and
                    worked with Bill and others in trying to effect that coordination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It worked out pretty well. We put together the first comprehensive
                    intelligence community program budget for presentation to Congress. This was the
                    first time it had all been put together in one document. One thing we didn't do
                    successfully, Bill wanted to set up an evaluation system to evaluate which
                    sources of intelligence were giving us the most value for the buck. We worked
                    very hard on that but didn't succeed. Later, after I left, they got an executive
                    order to back them up and it has worked quite well. I think it has been
                    disbanded now. We didn't have an executive order and had to do an awful lot by
                    persuasion and sort of an after the fact approach on some things. After the
                    executive order the Intelligence Community Staff became a more formalized part
                    of the community.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the various elements you had to deal with...INR of
                    the State Department which is essentially doing political analysis; and there is
                    Defense's National Security Agency [NSA] and CIA? Did you see a difference
                    between these as far as timeliness and effectiveness was concerned?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. The CIA as an organization is, I think, one of the most
                    professional in the government. It is a peculiar culture, part of which stems
                    from where it is located geographically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is across the Potomac...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It is isolated from Washington. What I observed, I don't know what it
                    is like now, but when I was there the Director was God. He was more important
                    than anyone in the government. He was more important than the President. They
                    would kill themselves for the Director. They would do anything for him. They
                    would work night after night or whatever he wanted. The distortion in their
                    thinking was that what he wanted was the most important thing going. I am sure
                    they probably thought he should have been a member of the cabinet which under
                    Carter [he was].</p>

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think it is a big mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a big mistake, he is an advisor rather than an

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Now, Colby was a pretty humble guy and never took advantage of that,
                    but they are very responsive to the Director and they are very good. They
                    do...it has happened often enough and people commented on it how they can get a
                    mind set in the analytical part of CIA and not see it. The 1973 war in the
                    Middle East...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the October War, the Yom Kippur War, between

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: ...was missed by the Agency in spite of the fact that they had the war
                    plans. This compartmentalization can be a problem. In the process of trying to
                    set up this evaluation program I went around interviewing a lot of people. I was
                    talking to an analyst out in NSA about his work and how we could evaluate it and
                    he, I have forgotten what prompted him to say this, I must have asked him
                    something about how much he produced or something, said, “Oh, I know a lot more
                    than I write down.” So there it was. God knows how much intelligence was resting
                    in this guy's mind and never going anywhere. And there is a problem in NSA of
                    distribution of intelligence. I have run into that. I am sure we have all run
                    into it. Right up to the end of my career we were having problems with NSA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: NSA being the people who do the eavesdropping with radio

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: They have one source that is very sensitive, and this was when I was
                    working in counterterrorism, and they were very sensitive about it and would not
                    send us any raw intelligence, only stuff that they had worked on themselves.
                    They made mistakes, they were not experts. They made mistakes in names. There
                    was a big brouhaha about this, it was never solved. I have forgotten who was
                    there, I think it was Inman. There is a big difference in the military between
                    strategic and tactical intelligence. It is an ongoing, never ending problem. The
                    biggest problem with intelligence is when do you know you have it.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: How do you know when you have it and how do you know when you haven't
                    got it. Of course intentions is the biggest [and most difficult] thing to get a
                    hold of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they hauled you back for the collapse of

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Larry Eagleburger called and asked if I would come down. I had been in
                    touch with some of the people in the State Department. I was sitting out there
                    watching Vietnam collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I knew there was some agitation within the State Department to get
                    ready for the end and Kissinger was holding them off, I think, for perfectly
                    good reasons because the announcement of a task force on Vietnam would become a
                    self-fulling prophesy. But Larry, who at the time was Under Secretary for
                    Management but really Kissinger's right hand man, called and asked if I would be
                    willing to come down and help Dean Brown run this task force. I went in to see
                    Bill Colby and asked what he wanted me to do. He said, “Go, that is more
                    important than anything we are doing here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when in 1975?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: April 17 or 18. I remember because we had about ten daybefore Saigon
                    fell and nothing had been done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this that we didn't want to talk the untalkable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Kissinger didn't want it getting out that we had formed a task force
                    to plan for the end of South Vietnam as an independent country. I don't think he
                    or anybody else knew that it was going to unravel as fast as it did.</p>
                <p>I called Larry back and told him Bill had said it was okay. He said, “Fine, why
                    don't you come down in the morning.” And I said, “Why don't I come right now.”
                    It was in the afternoon. I went on down and met with Phil Habib, Dean Brown, who
                    I had never met before. I knew Phil from Vietnam. We met in Larry's office and
                    drafted a memorandum for the President establishing the task force. Phil had
                    resisted it, too. It was his area, he had been running it. But he acquiesced and
                    from then on was quite supportive. Larry had promised me a blank check for
                    whatever I wanted or needed. So Dean became then Mr. Outside and I was Mr.
                    Inside. He dealt with the Congress and the press and I ran the task force.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the job of the task force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: First of all we had to get organized and we had 12 government agencies
                    involved. We had to get policies together of what we were going to do if Saigon
                    fell. I quickly decided to let the military do their own planning. We wouldn't
                    try and meddle with that. They had done some contingency planning. Later that
                    became a problem which I will come back to. But nothing had been done about what
                    do we do about the Vietnamese. There was not even thinking about it except by
                    some Young Turks like Craig Johnstone and people like that. So we had to get
                    together and get a coordinated government policy position of what we were going
                    to do. We started off with the Immigration and Naturalization Service under a
                    former Marine four-star general who flatly opposed any Vietnamese coming to this
                    country. Some of those meetings of 12 agencies were stormy. And we had to get
                    money, we had no money. We had to go up on the Hill and get money. We found
                    that, of all people, the great refugee [supporter] who had hounded us in Vietnam
                    about refugees this and refugees that, Ted Kennedy, was opposed to this. He said
                    we were going to bring all the fat cats, all the wrong people in. We got to him
                    through the Catholic Church. Rodino was the hero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Peter Rodino of New Jersey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He was the hero for us, he carried the weight. We kept him closely
                    briefed. He made a remarkable speech on the floor about immigrants and being
                    from an immigrant family which carried the day. We didn't even know how much
                    money to ask for. As it turned out, we gave some money back. We got one of the
                    few positive GAO reports I have ever seen for a program like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking in terms of number of
                        Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We didn't know what to expect. I think we finally used a figure in the
                    neighborhood of 250,000-300,000. We were also working with the embassy and MACV
                    trying to persuade them what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the embassy under Graham
                        Martin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Graham Martin. There was a steady flow of back channel messages with
                    Martin. Martin wanted to stay even after the outcome was clear. He wanted to
                    stay and negotiate with the North Vietnamese. There has been some misplaced
                    criticism, I think, of Martin about lack of planning. I think Saigon, being what
                    it was like, if the embassy had done any detailed planning it would have gotten
                    out. So I don't fault him for that. But they did miss it though. George
                    Jacobson, who was working very close with Martin, stopped by at the task force
                    after they had gotten home and said, “Well, for once you guys who were 10,000
                    miles away got it right.” We had a hard time convincing him to start evacuating,
                    but did finally get them started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you persuade them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I don't think we did persuade them. I think eventfinally did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was so obvious from here that after Da Nang
                        fell...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think they just couldn't believe it. I think it was when II Corp
                    collapsed that the embassy finally realized the situation. I can't remember
                    exactly. We were working night and day up in the Operations Center at the State
                    Department. The situation there created a fascinating psychological problem and
                    a problem from an historian's point of view as well, because there are no
                    windows up there and you have no time reference. You didn't know if it was night
                    or day. So you can't remember when things happen. It is very hard to remember.
                    That whole task force was one long interrupted conversation. You just bounce
                    from one subject to another. I would get home three or four in the morning, lay
                    down for an hour and go back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say it was a conversation, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: First of all we were trying to figure out what was going on in
                    Vietnam. We were planning for the worse case, a great exodus. We were trying to
                    figure out how we could get out those who had worked with us, so they wouldn't
                    be killed or tortured. We were all afraid there was going to be real bloodshed.
                    The military would tell us that one day they could get 10,000 out and the next
                    day they would say they could only get the Americans out. They were back and
                    forth. We were trying to decide where to put them. We were having this fight
                    with the INS. The Washington Action Committee had been activated and was holding
                    meetings over at the White House. We couldn't get an answer out of them. We had
                    given Okinawa back to the Japanese. Where were we going to put these people? And
                    it was typhoon season. But we had no choice, we finally selected Guam and Wake
                    Island as first places. We couldn't get an answer out of the committee. Some of
                    these people were starting to leave on their own. We were also dealing with the
                    airlift. We had started the airlift out of Tan San Nhut, went to Manila and then
                    they started piling up in Manila and the Filipinos started yelling to get them
                    out of here.</p>
                <p>The descent on Guam was so close that we sent the admiral a cable saying to get
                    ready because you have 25,000 people coming at you in about 24 hours. What
                    happened was that we suddenly had a fleet out there of about 35,000, the first
                    wave coming out of the Delta area. I got phone calls asking what to do with this
                    ship that is along side which is listing and full of people. I would say to get
                    the people off. One of those ships floated all the way to Hong Kong.We were
                    setting up the camps and trying to decide how we were going to deal with it. The
                    basic issues of who is going to deal with it. I said that there is only one
                    organization capable of dealing with this many people, moving them, feeding
                    them, and that is the military. The military has got to do it. So that was one
                    big hurdle we had to get across. Once we got that then you have to watch the
                    military because they will get out from under you and “boom” they are off and
                    running again.</p>
                <p>Then we selected the camps here and had to get them activated. Whad to find
                    civilians to run them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine the governors were not very happy about
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We had to stay in touch with the governors, congressional delegations.
                    There were a million things to do. I virtually moved into the Operations
                    Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the CIA, they had probably the most sensitive
                        group opeople that you had to get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We got a lot of those out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they sort of operate on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, they worked with us. They got them out. There was one story...I
                    had handpicked the beginning group. We started in one room of the Operations
                    Center and ended up taking over the entire Operations Center before it was over.
                    Craig Johnstone was one. Lionel Rosenblatt was another among a lot of people.
                    Paul Hare and Frank Wisner, all these people...I called them directly and told
                    them to get up here, there is no time to waste. And, of course, Larry backed me
                    up on that. We broke every rule in the book when it came to getting people.One
                    day Craig Johnstone and Lionel Rosenblatt didn't show up. They didn't show up
                    the second day. I said I bet I know where they are and sure enough they had gone
                    back to Vietnam on their own. There has been a movie made out of this. They got
                    a lot of those people you were talking about out by putting them in trunks of
                    cars and getting them to where they were able to board a CIA plane. (this was
                    before the final evacuation, obviously). The movie was called The Last Plane
                    Out. I haven't seen it.</p>
                <p>Of course, these two officers had gone against orders and Kissinger was furious.
                    Larry was mad at first and I said, “Larry you can't discipline these guys, look
                    at what they did.” Kissinger called him in and read him the riot act and then
                    said he was very proud of them. They both later got a award.</p>
                <p>But it didn't end with the final evacuation. That was an awful night. We were
                    listening in the Ops Center on an open radio to the helicopters going in. They
                    turned back, you know, all but the lead helicopter. I have never known and never
                    seen any explanation of it, but there was an order that came over the radio to
                    turn back. It must have come from the North Vietnamese. And the general landed,
                    looked up and there was nobody behind him. So they had to get everybody back out
                    and over there. We listened to that whole thing. It was one of the saddest
                    nights, God, it was depressing. You could cut the gloom in the Operations
                    Center. Larry was trying to make jokes to cheer us up and get us through it. We
                    were all there. Phil was there. Larry was there.</p>
                <p>But it didn't end with that for us because we had all these people coming out. We
                    were still patrolling just outside territorial waters. We had to get these camps
                    set up. We wanted to get Vietnamese speakers, FSOs into these camps, which we
                    were able to do. A funny story there. One of the fellows that I had sent out to
                    Guam, who was actually military but he had worked with us in Vietnam...he had
                    taught himself Vietnamese. I sent him out to Camp Monitor, Guam, and we had this
                    tent city of 25,000 at one time. A year later, by the way, a typhoon hit Guam
                    and it would have wiped out such a camp. That was one of our nightmares. This
                    fellow was walking through one of the camps one night and two or three elderly
                    Vietnamese asked him to come over and said, “We notice you speak Vietnamese.”
                    And he said, “Yes.” They said, “Can we ask you a question?” And he said, “Of
                    course.” “ Were are we?” They had been out fishing and this huge aircraft
                    carrier comes by and sweeps them up. And when he said, “You are in the United
                    States,” they said, “Oh, shit.” They had no intention of leaving, they were just
                    out fishing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What turned the INS around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Visiting the camps. Well, first of all, the first big breakthrough we
                    got with General Ewing was at one of the big 12 agency meetings, everybody sent
                    two or three people so the conference room was just jammed with people. We had
                    this flotilla of ships floating around. Finally I lost my temper with the guy
                    and said, “What do you want us to do with these 35,000 people, let them just
                    sink? We have to put them some where, we have to put them on Guam.” He was
                    afraid that if you put them on Guam they would be able to claim political
                    asylum. I said, “These people know nothing about political asylum.” And he
                    finally gave in. Then he visited the camp and met some of the people. He just
                    turned around completely. He thought we were going to bring in bad guys, and we
                    did get a few, but by in large they were good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the thing really developed and all of a sudden you
                        had tenof thousands of people coming out, how did Congress respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We had to keep going up and changing our estimate and they were
                    getting pretty irritated with us. Once it was going there was no way to stop it.
                    We set up four camps in the States. We had to have a processing system and had
                    to set up all that. We had to do the planning of how long it was going to take,
                    how long to keep the camps open, etc. The military was absolutely magnificent.
                    They had these places ready. Camp Pendleton was ready with just a few hours to
                    spare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Camp Pendleton in California.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. There was Pendleton in California, Chaffee in Arkansas, one in
                    Texas...there were four or five camps. We ended up bringing 250,000 people.
                    There came a point when we had our own internal arguments about when was the
                    time to stop. We were well past the point of getting people who were in
                    political danger. It was becoming an economic thing. In fact, several years
                    later I returned to the subject with Phil Habib when he was Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. There was a sudden surge of people out of Vietnam and the
                    White House got concerned about it and wanted to know what we should do. I wrote
                    a long paper for Phil pointing out that these were economic refugees.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>One of the interesting things that happened, the Viet Cong had planted some
                    agitators and they were causing trouble at various camps and wanted to go back
                    to Vietnam. We consolidated them all out in California and someone asked, “What
                    are we going to do with all these people?” I said, “Well, let's send them back.”
                    We found a ship that was in Hawaii that was seaworthy. No one knew to whom it
                    belonged. We found that among these 2,500 there were some seamen. So I wrote a
                    memorandum to Phil saying, “Let's stock this ship for about a million bucks and
                    escort it to within 12 or 3 miles, whichever the territorial limit was, and send
                    them back.” And we did. And that was the end of that. They wanted to go back, so
                    we did it. Don't know what happened to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's cut it off and pick it up next time when you were
                        dealinwith the Sinai mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Fine.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is January 20, 1994 and we continue the interview. After the Vietnam
                    task force and dealing with the immediate repercussions of the fall of Vietnam,
                    what happened to you then?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Larry Eagleburger talked to me about staying in the State Department.
                    He wanted to establish another assistant secretary-level position for a resource
                    manager, but that never happened. At one point I did a special job for Phil
                    Habib. I think the Sinai Mission was the next thing I did. Larry asked me to
                    take on the establishment of the Sinai Mission. Now this was right after the Yom
                    Kippur war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Yom Kippur war was in 1973. So by the time you
                        finished thimmediate Vietnam business, we are talking about late 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: What had happened there was the agreement that Kissinger had managed
                    to negotiate for the separation of forces. Both sides [Israel and Egypt] wanted
                    an American presence between them. I think we started this in October, November
                    and we had to have it done with an early warning system set up between the
                    forces in order for them to disengage. This disengagement was to take place, I
                    think, in February. So we had a strict deadline on us. We had other restrictions
                    placed on us by the Congress when the money bill was passed for it. We couldn't
                    use anybody who was actively military, they had to be retired at least a year.
                    We couldn't use any intelligence officers and we had to use maximum involvement
                    of private industry. This was to be set up where the Sinai Pass is. Basically
                    there is nothing there but a water line left by the Israelis. It was just
                    desert. So we were faced with building a small town to support the associated
                    early warning system. And we were to do it on contract, bid. And we did it. We
                    got it done. I was the acting director of the Sinai Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing it in Sinai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, from Washington. Q: How did you get the contract?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, we sent a team out first. We put together a team of different
                    skills that were necessary. I called on some people that I had worked with in
                    the past and who had different skills, whether it was engineering or electronics
                    or communications. etc. Based on their survey we put together an RFP [request
                    for a proposal], which went out on the street. It requested industry to respond
                    in an unusual way because there was very short time. We spent that December and
                    Christmas working, evaluating the various bids that we got. The main bid we got
                    was from E-Systems who had subcontracted to a construction company in San
                    Antonio, Texas, run by a self-made man who started by laying sidewalks. It was a
                    fascinating company. They went to him because he had a hobby of building modular
                    buildings and had put up a hotel for some kind of fair in San Antonio using
                    modules that were about the size of a railroad freight car. They were completely
                    self-contained, basically a little apartment. That was the concept we bought. We
                    then proceeded with it. They made every deadline we gave. And we made our
                    deadline and were operational when we had to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main problems that you found?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, we had a multitude of problems. We didn't think we would be able
                    to communicate from there. This fellow that I had brought in devised a system
                    where we bounced a signal off the side of the mountain to be able to communicate
                    out to the Egyptian and Israeli governments. We had trouble with the size and
                    weight of these modules. Half way through the planning one of the engineers...at
                    that time there was only a pontoon bridge across the Suez Canal and we had
                    planned to go in through Egypt...figured out that one of the modules would have
                    sunk that bridge. So we had to go in through Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Exactra was the name of the construction company. Boy, what a can-do outfit they
                    were. They went out there and set up search lights to work at night and built a
                    town, as well as laying in these sensors that reported any movement across the
                    lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the sensors and what were you trying to
                        accomplish witthem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We were trying to assure both sides that they would be notified by a
                    third party, and they wanted Americans to do it, of any movement towards their
                    lines as they withdrew. The Sinai Pass is a key pass in the area, the only way
                    through for armor in either direction. It is like a choke point. We had senors
                    that would sense movement and laid them out on the desert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How cooperative did you find the Egyptians and the
                        Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Quite cooperative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Both sides, yes. They wanted to disengage and wanted our presence
                    there. We also were doing overflights regularly for photography and providing
                    them to both sides.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that has come up at a later date from people who have dealt
                    with this is that one gets the feeling that the Egyptians were sort of cloddish,
                    and the Israelis were always probing and trying to take another inch, almost
                    like it was a game. Did you find this at all a problem?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Not during my time because once it was up and running I turned it over
                    to [another officer]. He ran it for the next several years. I went on to
                    Management Operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Congress pretty much behind this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Congress was supportive except for the restrictions they put on us
                    which made it more difficult to get the job done. We didn't have a lot of
                    bureaucratic problems. The major problem we had was the time pressure and there
                    industry responded, I must say, admirably, and the physical reality of what had
                    to be done within the time constraints. The other problem was manning it and
                    again we had to use a lot of contractors who had to be screened with background
                    checks and all that. So there was a lot that had to be done within the short
                    time we had to get it done. Those were the main problems. We had good support.
                    We didn't have any major bureaucratic problems either within the executive
                    branch or with Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were also drawing upon a tremendous amount of
                        expertiswhich had come out of the Vietnam war weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both civilian and military. There were people basically in
                        theiprime who had been there. There is nothing like a war to hone
                        skills.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We put together a very good team. The evaluation of the contracts was
                    done on a highly expedited basis. We had special teams working around the clock
                    almost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds as if you got the right contractor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, it was good. Unfortunately I never got to see it.I never went out
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that lasted into 1976. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved over to management for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Director of Management Operations, which was basically the way Larry
                    Eagleburger ran it. Larry was Under Secretary for Management and he used that
                    position as his deputy. Whenever Larry was traveling, I was acting Under
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>Q: Larry Eagleburger is an important figure within the Department of State, later
                    being Secretary of State. From watching him in the management job and as his
                    alter ego, how did he operate?</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Larry was much more than Under Secretary of State for Management. He
                    was still Kissinger's right hand man, even though he had moved over from that
                    Executive Assistant job he had held previously. I would say that 60 percent of
                    his work was still with Kissinger, writing his speeches, debating with him over
                    policy, etc. As for management, Larry takes a very common sense approach to most
                    things. He delegated a lot of work to his assistant secretaries. He had a pretty
                    good, small staff there right around him. And then there was Management
                    Operations. I did a lot of the managing. We set up a number of management
                    instruments which managed the budget process, which I did mostly. Larry would
                    chair most of the important meetings with the assistant secretaries and resolve
                    any major differences. We also set up a continuous standing committee on, for
                    example, managing the allocation of personnel positions throughout the
                    Department and around the world. Consequently, [there] wasn't always a crisis
                    that we had to come running in at the last minute [to settle]. It was a
                    continuous review of the process. This also opened up management. A lot of these
                    decisions had always been made, not really in the dark, but people weren't part
                    of the process and didn't understand how the decisions had been arrived at. We
                    opened that up by having the geographical bureaus and functional bureaus
                    represented on these different management instruments that we set up.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you ever wrestle with the problem of cutting down on representation by
                    non-State agencies in embassies abroad, particularly the Department of Defense?
                    The State Department is always trying to cut down but other agencies seem to
                    expand. That is an impression I have.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, it is true. There was at that time a system, I can't think of
                    its acronym, but supposedly State was in the chair of that and ran the system.
                    We automated it at that time. It has since been disbanded because there were so
                    many struggles and fights over it. But the fights with other agencies for
                    positions abroad would literally end up all the way over in the NSC at the
                    deputies' committee that they had in those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationale to continue expansion of other
                        agencieabroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, I guess in fairness, they saw a need from their point of view to
                    have representation. They didn't want to take just the reporting from the
                    Foreign Service, but wanted their own people to deal with their counterparts in
                    the foreign government. A lot of it, too, I always thought, was that it was
                    sexier. We ran into this in my last assignment in counterterrorism because the
                    FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] discovered the outside world.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the top management level of the State Department?
                    One of the criticism of the State Department for decades has been that there are
                    a lot of fine people grossly mismanaged by these same fine people.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: When we say “managed the State Department,” what do we mean? Are we
                    talking about managing mainly personnel, as far as managing the State Department
                    itself? If we are talking about managing issues in Washington vis-a-vis the
                    other agencies who have an interest in those issues, that is a different matter
                    entirely. I don't know which one you want to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about personnel first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I always felt we never had a professional personnel manager and still
                    don't. We have this notion, much like the military, that once you reach flag
                    rank you can do anything. Instead of having professionally trained people in
                    managing personnel and managing the systems, we insist on doing it with our own
                    Foreign Service people who have no particular background in it. If you look at
                    the string of director generals you will find some very fine people but none
                    with any particular background in personnel management.</p>
                <p>Then the other problem, I thought, is that we never leave the system alone long
                    enough to figure out what was wrong with it. We tinker with it all the time.
                    Either we, Congress, or somebody was always tinkering with it before a system
                    was allowed to function long enough to really see whether it was working or
                    not.</p>
                <p>The managing of the issues was a different matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was management involved in the management of issues or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Not really. Larry, himself, was, because of his relationship with
                    Kissinger. But there I always thought the State Department was weakened by not
                    having people at the deputy assistant secretary [DAS] level in those jobs long
                    enough to provide the kind of continuity and building up of credibility to go up
                    against the other agencies in town. The other agencies in town did have people
                    who had been in those jobs five and ten years. Larry and I talked many times
                    about what we could do to help with that. We talked about making the DAS job a
                    five-year assignment. It never came to pass. Another thing we talked about was
                    the lack of management experience most Foreign Service officers have. As you go
                    up the chain you don't really get much management experience. We tried some
                    interchanges with other agencies, but it never became a systematic thing. For
                    example, AID people do manage programs. They are probably better managers than
                    Foreign Service officers. Then suddenly you find yourself either a DCM or an
                    ambassador and you are responsible for managing this whole thing and people
                    don't have the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't in this management job very long were

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have from 1976-77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was in that job until the change of administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. And then the Democrats came in. I had not gotten my career status
                    back at that point having come back from the civil service. So I had no
                    claim...normally I think before and after a person leaving that job of director
                    of Management Operations, has gotten a post, but I had no claim on that at that
                    time. But I knew Richard Luce who came in as Under Secretary for Management from
                    the days in Vietnam when he was working on the Hill and would make trips out to
                    Vietnam. So I stayed on and worked for Luce for a while. We did away with the
                    Inspector General Foreign Assistance organization. I made a major study for Dick
                    on that and we ended up abolishing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for abolishing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It wasn't effective. The way it was set up it had two bosses, the
                    Congress and the executive branch. The State Department fought this new
                    arrangement of the Inspector General for a long, long time successfully, but
                    then finally lost. But the people running the Inspector General Foreign
                    Assistance were actually sending drafts of reports up to the Hill that the staff
                    were to comment on before putting it into final. It was outrageous. It was just
                    totally ineffective and a waste of resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it difficult? Once something like that has its own
                        clienteland Congress, I would think it would be very hard to get rid of
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was pretty hard but we managed to get it done.</p>
                <p>Q: Transitions are always interesting to look at. The Carter Administration was
                    coming in. From the management point of view, how did this transition work
                    out?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The Carter people, it seemed to me, had a total lack of trust of
                    people that were in the government. We found that if you wanted them to go in
                    one direction you recommended the opposite because that is what they would do.
                    They were very suspicious of the whole bureaucracy, not just the State
                    Department. I did all the management briefing papers for the transition team.
                    They fired so many people in the White House that they got down to the technical
                    level and when they wanted to get agr�ment, there was nobody there who knew how
                    to do it. The people they fired were steady career people who had been there for
                    years and years with no political ax to grind at all. Another amusing thing to
                    me was when they first came in, it was like amateur hour. Burt Lance, OMB, sent
                    around, and somehow it got out and around, a little note saying, “Why do we have
                    all of these personnel files in the federal government. Get rid of all these
                    files.” He had completely forgotten about social security and all these things
                    that make it absolutely essential that you have files on people.</p>
                <p>[This attitude] stopped very quickly, but we did see memos that had been sent to
                    the White House and had found their way to Carter's desk and the margin area
                    where he had written on some of these documents showed he was looking at them in
                    incredible detail. The old story that he was managing the tennis court is
                    absolutely true. Documents got on his desk that should never have even been sent
                    over there because they didn't warrant the attention of the President of the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>They brought in another one of these management systems, zero basbudgeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where you start from the very beginning and figure
                        out...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, and finally like NBO and those before them, collapsed of its own
                    weight. But those things tend to put the bureaucracy through a really agonizing
                    amounts of time and paperwork and energy and frustration. It was after Reagan
                    that I decided I would never vote for somebody from the state level again. They
                    inevitably bring with them people from the state level, which is just human
                    nature, people they know and trust who come in and just don't know the first
                    thing about Washington. It takes them at least a year or two to learn it, at
                    least that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are going through that now with the Clinton
                        Administratiocoming out of Arkansas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, we've going through it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We went through it with Reagan coming out of California
                        anCarter out of Georgia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Actually Reagan didn't get his team together until the last two years
                    of his second administration. He finally got together a good team that was
                    largely a result of, I think, George Shultz. It wasn't until then that we had a
                    team that was really smooth and functioning in a cooperative way.</p>
                <p>Q: Can we talk a little bit about [Richard] Moose? Moose is now the Under
                    Secretary for Administration. The word was he went into Administration but was
                    so poor at it that he was moved over under the Carter Administration to African
                    Affairs, where apparently he was more in his own milieu. Did you find him
                    administratively focused or not?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: He was a bit out of his element, being more of a policy fellow. I
                    think he was much more comfortable in the African Bureau. I never understood why
                    he was selected for that job. He didn't have any particular background for it. I
                    never knew for sure whether he seized an opportunity and made that move himself,
                    or whether people perceived that he needed to be moved. I never really knew what
                    was behind the move. I did think it was a good move for the Department and that
                    he would do a better job in Africa. Dick is a very nice guy. He tends to go more
                    on intuition than on anything else. Perhaps he is too nice for that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you working for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I would have to look back and see when I went into the Inspection
                    Corps. Bob Sayre called me and asked if I wanted to become a senior inspector.
                    That must have been in 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went into the Inspector Corps, what was your
                        primfunction at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was a senior inspector. Initially they were going to set up a second
                    deputy and I even have a plaque that names me deputy of inspections, but it
                    never happened.I led a team to the Benelux countries and then did an inspection
                    within the Department of what is now called FAIM [Foreign Affairs Information
                    Management].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is Freedom of Information basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, it is all the documentation of the Department, [the “how to do it”
                    instructions for all Department functions]. While I was doing that inspection I
                    was asked by Ben Read...believe it or not there was a big fight as to who was
                    going to be responsible for Freedom of Information with John Thomas, Assistant
                    Secretary for Administration, wanting to have it as his responsibility and the
                    Bureaus saying they couldn't have anybody else doing this but us. Ben Read, who
                    was then Under Secretary of State for Management, asked me to look into this and
                    make a recommendation, which I did. Then they trapped me and asked me to carry
                    out my own recommendations which is how the Center for Declassification was
                    established. The concept was to stuff the declassified function with retirees.
                    All the retirees that work down there, lots of them, owe me a great debt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me there is life after death in the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: My idea was to get people representing each particular Bureau. They
                    have to be nominated by the Bureau or approved by the Bureau. So the Bureau is
                    comfortable that somebody they trust is reviewing their documents. Before that
                    time these poor desk officers had stacks of documents to review and had to do
                    them on the weekend and were way behind schedule. It was terrible. So we
                    centralized working within FADRC [Foreign Affairs Departmental Records Center]
                    and is now called FAIM. We set up offices there and also took over the
                    [declassification] review for the Historian's Office.</p>
                <p>Q: The Foreign Relations series.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The whole Foreign Relations of the United States [FRUS] series. So we
                    had two sets of offices basically. One doing day to day Freedom of Information
                    Act requests and another doing the systematic declassification which went to the
                    Historian's Office for publication in the Foreign Relations series. This was a
                    successful format and continues today.</p>
                <p>Q: What were the pressures setting this up, outside of getting the personnel to
                    do it? There is an ongoing battle between the diplomatic historians, columnists,
                    reporters, etc. about what documents haven't been coming out, etc.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I had a lot of trouble with the Historian's Office. I had a big fight
                    with the fellow who was historian at the time. He left the Department and went
                    over to the Department of the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he is a miliary historian. Trask was his name.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, David Trask. The academicians were the biggest problem and the
                    organizations that they had. They had mistakenly in my view...there was an
                    advisory committee made up of these academicians who would look over the
                    situation and issue an annual report. It was inevitably critical. It would get
                    into the papers and there would be a big to do about not releasing anything. Of
                    course, historians want everything right now. You can't do that with some of
                    these things.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it a problem of just dealing with a mass of paper or was it really a
                    problem of declassification with people wanting things that the desks didn't
                    want to come out?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was both. We had a massive backlog that the Department just hadn't
                    been able to be responsive to. So there was a lot of paper to go through, a lot
                    to be reviewed. But we had a system where the Bureaus had to clear off on what
                    we released, so there were checks and balances set in to prevent us from making
                    mistakes and releasing information that shouldn't be released. This did happen,
                    not so much with us, but with other agencies at that time. Documents would get
                    out that shouldn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Korea about this time and I remember something
                        came ouabout something we had said about the Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think that was the Kim De Jung case. We almost had a break in
                    relations because it revealed how the Korean CIA had kidnapped him out of Japan.
                    There was a big brouhaha. That happened just before we took over. It was another
                    little piece of good luck on timing. It sort of help to push the project
                    ahead.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that you have to be responsive to certain requests? If there was
                    an ongoing equivalent to a scandal or something like that that you would have
                    to...if we were concerned, say, about Korea...adjust the program so that you
                    could spew out more papers on that?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, that could be done. In principle we didn't do it. In principle it
                    was first in, first out. It would be unfair otherwise. But in reality we could
                    shift because we had the people.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find there was a difference among the Bureaus, with some letting it
                    all hang out and others just didn't understand and didn't want to let anyone
                    know anything?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, not really. A more recognizable pattern of behavior was how long
                    the person had been on the desk or in the director position; whether they were
                    familiar with the issues and how comfortable they felt dealing with it. Those
                    who were less familiar with the issues were more leery of letting things go. So
                    if there were variations it would be how long the person had been dealing with
                    the issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and went to the Secretariat. When was
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I went in 1981.</p>
                <p>Q: So this is a new administration, the Reagan Administration. If the Carter
                    Administration was a hostile takeover, Reagan seemed to be a hostile takeover
                    plus one.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was sort of isolated from it although I saw what was going on. I
                    wasn't personally involved in any of the dealing with the incoming
                    administration. I wasn't preparing or doing any briefings. But I knew people who
                    were involved and it was pretty rough. As I said earlier, as far as a national
                    security team there were all sorts of stops and starts and mistakes made. Bill
                    Clark was Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You gave a little shrug there. He really wasn't very
                        welinformed on foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, he wasn't. He never really did become well informeeither.</p>
                <p>Q: I used to have nightmares of Bill Clark waking his friend, Ronald Reagan, the
                    President, about a crisis and the two of them discussing what we should do. In
                    all fairness we are talking about a significant lack of depth of knowledge on
                    any international issue between those two.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I think we almost had that when Israel invaded Lebanon. Bill Clark was
                    over as National Security Advisor and was dealing directly with the President.
                    He was doing things without the knowledge of the Secretary of State that I
                    believe prolonged that war. He went through intermediaries telling the PLO not
                    to worry. That's my understanding. I can't prove it.</p>
                <p>Q: You moved to the Secretariat and what were you doing?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, Jerry Bremer was the Executive Secretary [S/S] and he had two
                    deputies. He asked me to come up and be one of the deputies, the other one was
                    Al Adams. Al and I sort of divided up the world and the Department bureaus. I
                    can't remember exactly how we divided it up but I had Europe, Political/Military
                    Affairs, Intelligence, etc. We would alternate traveling. At that time the
                    deputy was responsible for day-to-day review of the papers going in to the
                    Secretary and coming out from the Secretary, as well as his major lieutenants,
                    the Deputy Secretary, the under secretaries, also. We were looking for quality
                    control, appropriate coordination within the Department, clarity, etc. We would
                    stop the end runs and people trying to get into the Secretary without another
                    Bureau knowing about it. And then making sure the people got the decisions that
                    the Secretary made.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In addition, I ran the Operations Center and the Executive Secretary's equivalent
                    to an archives, records of all the decisions made by the Secretary of State. And
                    lastly, Al and I were responsible for, and we alternated trips, traveling with
                    the Secretary. We would be responsible for all the planning, both logistic,
                    schedule and substance, making sure he got the briefing papers he needed, the
                    right topics were covered, etc. We worked closely with the bureaus in that
                    connection. I was on Reagan's first trip abroad to Europe in 1982 on which was
                    the beginnings of the fall of Al Haig. It was a nightmare.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like to talk about that trip, but first, how was Al Haig? Here he was
                    Secretary of State coming out of a military background and the National Security
                    Council, how did he run the State Department? What did he want that might be
                    different than other Secretaries before him?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Haig used the Secretariat, unlike Kissinger. What I found surprising
                    in watching Haig operate...someone with his experience virtually run the
                    government in the last years of Nixon and failing to form any alliances in the
                    cabinet. Not taking the measure of people around the President before he made
                    recommendations and moves, which got him off to a very bad start. He went in and
                    proposed a C structure which is a model of Kissinger, etc. and did it, as I
                    understand on inauguration day. You would think that a man of his experience and
                    intelligence would have bided his time to make sure he had the measure of the
                    people around the President and just how it was going to work and try to form
                    some alliances. He went alone the whole time he was Secretary. He was a loner.
                    Almost as though he was the one man in town who really understood what really
                    needed to be done and how to do it. I think that didn't go down very well
                    either.</p>
                <p>Q: It came across even in his public business including when President Reagan was
                    shot. It was sort of an arrogance of “I can take care of things.”</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. It certainly was confidence. That particular incident was
                    unfortunate in that he was doing the right thing. He was down in the situation
                    room of the White House along with Weinberger and some others. Larry Speakes was
                    on TV and they were watching him. He was making big mistakes in saying things
                    that shouldn't have been said, particularly about what we were doing with armed
                    forces and things like that. So Haig ran up the stairs, didn't take a minute to
                    catch his breath or think of what he was going to say. He was so anxious to get
                    Speakes off the air so the wrong messages weren't sent, particularly to the
                    Soviets. So Haig was doing the right thing. But he didn't stop to catch his
                    breath and went out there out of breath and plunged in and misspoke, which was
                    unfortunate. It was Bill Clark and Mike Deavers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view watching Haig, were you seeing
                        dangesignals coming from the National Security Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, but where they became much more evident was on thatrip.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It was a nightmare trip for everybody involved because of the
                    schedule, it was so heavy. I made a couple of advance trips witMike Deavers and
                    his people and I kept trying to tell them that they were over scheduling the
                    President. Sure enough, if you remember, he fell asleep when he was talking to
                    the Pope on worldwide TV. It was just too much. We had back to back summits. The
                    economic summit and the NATO summit, a visit to the Pope. We were gone ten days.
                    I think I averaged about three hours of sleep a night.</p>
                <p>The signs of an attitude towards Haig started during the advances and planning.
                    Where is Haig in the motorcade? I had to get him in the right place in the
                    motorcade. I had to go to the French to get him from Paris to Versailles, in a
                    French helicopter. I learned on one of the advance trips that Reagan was
                    secretly planning an extra day in Paris, going in a day early for a private
                    visit. I was having great difficulty getting adequate space for the staff out of
                    Versailles where the economic summit was going to take place. The White House
                    people were being very uncooperative in giving us adequate space and putting us
                    out of touch with the Secretary. We couldn't support him the way they were
                    setting us up. So I looked around and noticed that the White House had not
                    reserved any hotel space in Paris. I got a hold of the embassy housing guy and
                    we went to the Crillon and blocked two floors and I just sat back and waited.
                    About a week after we got back to Washington I get this phone call from the
                    White House advance team. “We have a little problem with hotel space in Paris.”
                    So I traded with them. I didn't need all of the space I had blocked so I gave
                    them Paris space and got adequate space from them out at Versailles. That was
                    the way I had to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just an inexperienced White House staff throwing
                        theiweight around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, this was coming from the top. Not from Reagan, but in my judgment,
                    from Bill Clark. During the trip it went from protocol questions and logistical
                    problems into substance, foreign policy issues. Repeatedly Haig was being
                    bypassed. He was right there in the room or in the building and Clark was going
                    directly to the President on issues of UN votes...This was before we had a
                    classified fax. The White House had one. I made alliances with people on the
                    White House staff and got a hold of a letter from Reagan...in the middle of all
                    this Israel invaded Lebanon. We were at Versailles and we brought Phil Habib
                    down from England for a briefing and sent him on his way. Phil correctly
                    predicted they would not stop as they said they were going to stop, and that
                    they were going all the way to Beirut. I got a hold of this letter from Reagan
                    to Began begging for a cease fire. The Secretary of State didn't know anything
                    about it. He was off at a banquet or something. So I got on the phone to Jerry
                    Bremer, who was backing us up. I say, “Jerry, this letter, it is signed. Do you
                    know anything about it? What am I going to tell the Secretary of State?” He
                    said, “There is no such letter like that.” I say, “Jerry I am looking at the
                    letter.” He said, “I will be right back to you.” He called Bud McFarland, who
                    was then the deputy to Clark. Bud denied it. Jerry called me back and said that
                    there is no such letter. I said, “Jerry, God damn it, I am looking at it. I
                    can't send it to you but I will read it to you. And it is signed.” And Jerry, of
                    course, blew his stack and got back to Bud who finally admitted the letter had
                    gone out. I had to go and show it to the Secretary of State when he got back and
                    tell him it had already gone out. A major foreign policy issue in the midst of
                    warfare. And it just kept on happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this that Clark just didn't cotton to Haig...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: In my judgment they were just setting him up. Haig had occasionally
                    threatened to resign and they set him up. They pushed him to the brink and when
                    he made his move... actually it was after we got back and an NSC meeting was
                    called on the pipeline issue.</p>
                <p>Q: This was the natural gas pipeline from Europe to Russia which we were trying
                    to stop and the Europeans wanted.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There was an NSC meeting on that subject and a decision was taken when
                    Haig was up in New York. And that and everything that happened on this trip
                    prompted him to go over and try to have a heart-to-heart talk with the
                    President. That was when they accepted his resignation.</p>
                <p>Q: I have one oral history talking about being in a castle in England where in
                    the middle of the night he over heard Haig calling the President on the Israeli
                    business.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: That would have been Windsor Castle.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was really screaming at the President on the Israeli
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I don't know about that. But I found myself wandering around about 3
                    or 4 in the morning in Windsor Castle looking for the Secretary of State and
                    bumping into Deavers in his pajamas. I thought for a while it was a replay of
                    Macbeth or something. It is really unreal because I had on the other end of the
                    phone Eagleburger and Bremer screaming at me that the UN was about to take a
                    vote and did the Secretary know anything about it. I had to say that I didn't
                    know where the Secretary of State is, that I couldn't find him. “What do you
                    mean you don't know where he is? You had God damn better find out where he is
                    and get him to this phone.”</p>
                <p>As staff we weren't quartered in Windsor Castle, Haig and Woody Goldberg, his
                    assistant, were. I remember at 3 or 4 in the morning, Haig and I looking at each
                    other and Haig saying, “What the hell is going on?” I think it dawned on both of
                    us at the same time that this was not an accident. These series of events were
                    not accidental. This was a deliberate strategy that Clark and Deavers had
                    decided on to get rid of Haig.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any feeling that Shultz was what they wanted to come out of this?
                    Shultz turned out to be more or less his own person.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, he did. A lot of it had to do with style, chemistry, personality.
                    These guys from California were Californians. They were easy going and Haig
                    comes into a room and sparks would start flying and he sits down at a table in a
                    meeting and it is all wham, bang. I thought Haig was generally on target as far
                    as the substance and polices he wanted to pursue. Except I think he wasted a lot
                    of energy on Cuba, but that is another matter. So this had been building for a
                    while. I think they finally decided this was a good opportunity to really
                    humiliate him in front of his staff. On one occasion they were at the same
                    banquet table when Clark goes over and whispers in the President's ear and goes
                    off and made a major foreign policy decision and doesn't even tell the Secretary
                    of State. Doesn't even tell him, much less involve him in the discussion.</p>
                <p>Q: Clark was probably as close to an international illiterate as you can come
                    when he came to the job. Were these initiatives just coming out of the top of
                    his head?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: These were driven by world events that were taking place. What he was
                    doing was seizing on the need for decisions on those issues. He would go
                    directly to the President with them and cut out the Secretary of State. The
                    basic plan was that you drive this man nuts and he will come in an resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting this from the White House staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Not like this. We knew there was some friction. For example, they
                    didn't like Haig's shuttle on the Falklands [issue]. They thought it was
                    grandstanding, I think. They tried to give him a plane with no windows in it. Al
                    Adams was on that trip. You will have to get him to tell you about it. Back and
                    forth to London and Buenos Aires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that they didn't want somebody else to get the
                        publicity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: They probably thought that he was upstaging the President. An anecdote
                    about Deavers. We had Phil Habib come to Versailles and talk to the President,
                    the Secretary, Clark and the others. My instructions were to make sure Haig got
                    to talk to him first. Because of some actions taken by a couple of young
                    non-professional people that Haig had brought in, that didn't work out. We had
                    two rooms in Versailles. One had been set aside for a quiet room for
                    conferences. I ended up with Phil and Clark and Deavers and a couple of other
                    people in that room waiting for the President and the Secretary to come down
                    from a conference that was up stairs. Clark is asking Phil questions and Phil is
                    briefing Clark about what he thinks is taking place and what is going to take
                    place. He is telling him this is war. Deavers is arranging the room for a photo
                    op and the President comes down. Initially I was stunned by this, I couldn't
                    believe this thinking, “God, he is a man of no substance at all.” Then I got to
                    thinking about it and realized it was his job and that is why he did it so well.
                    He was focused on what his job was and his job was to show the world that the
                    President was in charge and was sending Phil Habib off to deal with a terrible
                    situation in the Middle East. So that is why he was good. My first judgment of
                    him was basically wrong. He didn't get into substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all waiting for the shoe to drop? Were you aware
                        oHaig's use of this threatening to resign tactic at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I was not aware of that. Jerry may have been. We didn't know what was
                    going to happen on the day it happened. In fact, I had uncharacteristically left
                    the office up there and gone for a sandwich. I knew Haig had been over at the
                    White House. When I came back Jerry was in there with him and they were writing
                    the letter of resignation. I could feel the tension when I walked in. I said,
                    “What is going on?” I was told there was going to be an announcement at 1 or 2
                    o'clock from the White House, and we all watched it on TV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you continue in the job when Shultz took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an appreciable change in atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: A dramatic change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, Shultz is a very calm, deliberate man who is also very
                    thoughtful. He is very considerate. Not that Haig is inconsiderate, I didn't
                    mean it in that way. But Shultz has a totally different style and is a different
                    man. Haig was brimming over with energy. Not that Shultz doesn't have energy but
                    you don't feel it. He doesn't generate tension in a room, but Haig does just by
                    walking in a room. AnI think Shultz is a much more self-confident man than Haig
                    and much easier to work with. I think both are good men, but I like Shultz
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Shultz run the State Department differently, would you
                        say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. Shultz was a better manager. Shultz had tremendous experience. On
                    one of the trips with him we were waiting in the late early morning hours for a
                    phone call from Washington and we started talking about different things. I had
                    always been very impressed, all of us were, with the way Shultz came into the
                    State Department. He arrived absolutely alone. He didn't even bring a secretary.
                    He walked in on a Saturday, I think it was a Saturday, and there wasn't a single
                    person with him. He accepted every one of our recommendations for executive
                    assistant and secretaries, and just began working with everybody that was there.
                    This night he told me that he had gone in at the top of Labor, OMB, Treasury and
                    now the State Department and then Bechtel, a huge, huge corporation. He said
                    that he found that you really have to gain the support and loyalty of the people
                    in the organization. That is the way he did it. Haig just didn't think that way
                    at all, but Shultz did.</p>
                <p>Another thing that Haig did, that Shultz did not, was try to be Secretary of
                    State wherever he was. So trips were particularly hard on the staff. After
                    meetings or dinner he would come back to the hotel and get on the phone and call
                    Washington and we would be sitting up all night long cleaning up what he had
                    been doing. Sometimes he would tell us what he had been doing and sometimes he
                    wouldn't and we would have to find out what was going on because we had to
                    follow through on everything. Shultz was totally different. He would say, “I
                    have a deputy and I am going to concentrate on this trip. It is going to have
                    all of my attention. Washington, don't call me unless you really need me.” He
                    didn't want to be bothered unless really needed. This made a tremendous
                    difference for us because we could focus on the substance of the trip. The
                    assistant secretaries who traveled with him loved it because they got his full
                    attention on the trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a comfort level with the President's
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, it changed right away. The preparation for tripand so on, all
                    that changed.</p>
                <p>Q: So this gave you sort of a benchmark to understand what had been going on
                    before, that it wasn't the normal White House/State confrontation, there was
                    another agenda.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, that there was another agenda and that was now finished. Shultz
                    took his time and dealt very effectively with the White House staff and the
                    President. But we still had trouble with Clark until he left. He knew what
                    Reagan really wanted. This was particularly true as regard to the Soviet Union.
                    Shultz would go over and sit down with the President and go through an agenda of
                    things that he wanted to get done and should be doing like moves we should be
                    making vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. For example, opening a consulate in Kiev and
                    reestablishing cultural exchange programs. And the President would agree. Then
                    when we would try to implement, Clark would block it. I am sure he thought he
                    understood Reagan better than anybody else. It turned out that when he came to
                    these exchanges he didn't know what they were. He didn't even know what they
                    were, but he didn't want to do it. He didn't understand cultural exchanges.
                    Somewhere along in there we got somebody positioned on the NSC staff, Jack
                    Matlock. He was a big help to EUR [Bureau of European Affairs] in particular in
                    explaining these things to Clark. He could explain cultural exchanges to Clark
                    and assure him that we would not be giving in to the evil empire by implementing
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Shultz understand the problem with Clark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I am sure he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he try to work with Clark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: What he finally accomplished I am sure Deavers helped him with,
                    although I am sure Shultz was capable of doing it himself. He established a
                    rapport with the President, that was what he worked on and accomplished.</p>
                <p>Again on the Soviet Union...I was doing a lot with John Poindextethen...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the deputy head of the NSC at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, and I was dealing almost hourly with him on the phone. The
                    Secretary was due to make a major appearance before the Congress on relations
                    with the Soviet Union. The draft testimony was done up and sent over for
                    clearance at the White House. The President was up at Camp David. We were
                    getting close to the deadline and I was working with John trying to get the
                    thing back. It came back with almost no changes. John was absolutely shocked. He
                    said, “I don't believe this. I fully expected a major rewrite.” It wasn't the
                    hard line that Poindexter and Clark thought the President wanted, and they were
                    wrong. They were operating on a completely different agenda.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there for about a year and a half with Shultz. Did you have a feeling
                    that there was sort of a battle for the President's mind as far
                    as...particularly the Soviet Union. Was the State Department taking the line
                    that here is a power with which we are going to have to deal with?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There was that and of course the whole issue between the Defense
                    Department and the State Department on negotiations on nuclear weapons. The SALT
                    Talks and big fight between Rick Burt, Richard Pearl over in Defense. All those
                    issues were bubbling along at the same time. There was definitely a battle of
                    the minds. I think what really saved us was the SDI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the Strategic Defense Initiative called Star
                        Wars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It came out of the blue. We had been working on a speech for the
                    President, I have forgotten the occasion, and were at the penultimate
                    draft...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was the State of the Union address. I think he
                        madit before Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Maybe. It was a major speech. We got the penultimate draft and there,
                    out of the blue, was just a few lines announcing this initiative. I remember
                    Jerry Bremer coming in and saying, “Where the hell did this come from? What is
                    it? This is not our doctrine and is against everything we have been doing for
                    the last forty years. Where did it come from? What are we going to do?” We were
                    all running around with out hair on fire. We found out later on that it was the
                    President's science advisor who had persuaded the President to put this in
                    there. Once he got that in he wouldn't let go of it. That was what broke up
                    Reykjavik where they worked all night and almost got it, which I think would
                    have been a terrible mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was with Gorbachev and...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, to have 3 percent reduction in warheads or missiles or something.
                    The President wouldn't budge on Star Wars. That was one of the things that
                    brought the Soviet Union down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole idea was to have a defense that would stop all
                        incominmissiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: My guess is that the Soviets themselves decided in private that this
                    thing wasn't going to work, but if [the Americans] go full steam ahead on
                    research on this thing they are going to get spin offs that we can't keep up
                    with and we have to get it stopped. But I will never forget that night that the
                    speech came over and there it was.</p>
                <p>Q: One last thing before we stop this session, did you get any feel for the
                    relationship between George Shultz and Casper Weinberger? They both came out of
                    Bechtel and are both Californians.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I don't know about Weinberger, but Shultz can't stand him. I remember
                    telling Secretary Shultz when he first came in that he had a weekly breakfast
                    with Weinberger. He said, “Oh, shit, do I have to do that?” I never liked
                    Weinberger, myself, from a far. I thought he was one of the worse Secretaries of
                    Defense we ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He seemed to buy the complete military line, he didn't
                        seem to bin charge. But he also seemed to want to be Secretary of
                        State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, yes. In the early days, he got better about it, when he would take
                    a trip, particularly to the Middle East, he was very pro-Arab, we just held our
                    breath because we didn't know what he was going to say. But what I objected to,
                    he wanted all his military toys, but ask him to use those things and he would
                    pee in his pants. You couldn't move a Marine anywhere in the world without his
                    approval and he rarely approved. I think he was one of the stubbornest men in
                    public life. Shultz had known him in OMB and at Bechtel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they certainly knew each other intimately as far as
                        workinwith each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. But clearly Shultz didn't like the man at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this translate at your level to having build or
                        repaibridges with the Department of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: No, Shultz never let it get that way. He is a big man of strong
                    character. He would not have let that happen. We built bridges anyway, but we
                    didn't have any problem. The poison between State and Defense was this Richard
                    Pearl and Rick Burt duel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in this. Richard Pearl was considered
                        bmany to be a very strict hard liner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Well, Pearl wanted to bring down the Soviet Union and he thought that
                    we could, and it turns out that he was right. But they had very strong
                    differences of view. They were honestly held, it wasn't just a bureaucratic
                    fight. Rick had a good background in political/military affairs and so did
                    Pearl. The only way we got involve was sometimes refereeing and sometimes
                    reviewing the papers that went up to the Secretary from Burt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Rick Burt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, he was a political appointee. But he had a lot of experience in
                    writing about and studying political military affairs. So he had a good
                    background for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There weren't many light moments in that job. It was an extremely
                    demanding job. I was in there at six in the morning and would have a six inch
                    stack of cables to go through before the phone would start ringing. I would get
                    home about 11 at night. I would go weeks without seeing my wife and daughter
                    awake and that puts a lot of pressure on a marriage, I tell you. But it was one
                    of the most exciting jobs I ever had. It was just one thing after another.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Each Bureau has a personality. EUR is sort of like Europeans with pin stripped
                    suits and everything sort of proper. ARA [Bureau of Interamerican Affairs] is
                    ma�ana, very laid back. AF [Bureau of African Affairs] is sort of insecure,
                    although they didn't have to be when we were there. They had a strong front
                    office. They would come up on the screen and then go away, come up on the screen
                    and go away. There weren't that many issues. Namibia was the issue, I guess, at
                    that time. Then EA [Bureau of East Asian Affairs] was the most convoluted. We
                    had standard ways of sending documents out, of putting together documents for
                    the Secretary of State. It was straight forward, but they could never follow
                    that. They always came up with their own scheme with a memo on top of a memo,
                    etc. It would be a very convoluted thing that they would send up. It was very
                    Asian, very strange. EA was probably the worse at trying to get around other
                    Bureaus and not getting the clearances. But the Bureaus do have their own
                    personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Near East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I am not sure how we would characterize the Near East Bureau. The
                    peace process kept going on and on and there really wasn't anything to it but I
                    think you got more and tended to hear it. You tended to hear from that Bureau
                    more about process. EUR had some of that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that any Bureau was better at using the
                        system tget what they wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: NEA [Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs] was good in those
                    days. It changes depending on who is there. EUR was usually good. Those were
                    probably the two best. Of course, Tom Enders usually got what he wanted. I
                    remember once going into Secretary Haig...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of ARA at one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Right... going into Haig's office right after Enders had left. Haig
                    had rolled over on some issue and was sitting there sort of holding his head. He
                    said, “You know, if that guy just wasn't so God damn tall.” But that intimidated
                    a lot of people, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enders was known for both intellectual arrogance and
                        height. Hmade a lot of enemies but was also effective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes, he was very effective and extremely bright. He played a funny
                    role in the Falkland thing. He was pretty much on the side of the
                    Argentines.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the build up to the Falklands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The buildup was very rapid, of course. I dropped out of it pretty
                    quickly but I attended the first meeting in the Deputy Secretary's office on the
                    issue. I remember that Tom didn't want to do anything, whereas everybody else
                    thought we had to do something. We ended up supporting the UK. Tom effectively
                    blocked any action in that meeting so we lost some time there. Finally the
                    Secretary got involved and said we had to support the UK.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we probably should stop here and pick up next time

                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Okay, but let me tell you my favorite story about Shultz before we
                    close. I think it gives an insight into the man himself. We were on the way to
                    Moscow for Brezhnev's funeral and the Vice President was coming up from a trip
                    he was on in Africa and joined up with us in Moscow. Secretary Shultz and Vice
                    President Bush were going to be the first two Westerners to meet Andropov.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: You can imagine the things Shultz had on his mind. As we were
                    approaching our landing, I noticed the Secretary was looking all over the cabin
                    for something. I said, “Excuse me Mr. Secretary, can I help you find something?”
                    He said, “Well, I was looking for the New York Times because I am sure the
                    ambassador hasn't seen one for a long time.” That's the kind of man he was.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is June 3, 1994. Let's pick up with your time in the Secretariat. You
                    mentioned you had some comments about Sadat's assassination.</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: What I remember so clearly about the Sadat assassination was...I was
                    in early as usual at the Secretariat. I usually got in around 6:00 in order to
                    get through the stack of cables before the phones started ringing. My timing may
                    be off, but it seemed to me it was around 6:30 or 7:00 that we got the reports
                    over television. Later we learned why that was so. The assassination took place
                    at a public event that was being covered by television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Atherton was sitting in the stands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. But there were a couple of lessons learned. First of all there
                    was virtually no one in the Department. All the senior people were on their way
                    in, they were in traffic. I couldn't reach anybody. As in every crisis that I
                    have ever been involved in, there was lots of confusion at first as to whether
                    or not Sadat was in fact killed. We opened up a line, of course, to the embassy
                    and had embassy people going all over Cairo trying to find out. We had people at
                    the hospital even trying to find out. It was several hours before we knew. In
                    the meanwhile, the press started calling the Operations Center and we had not
                    gotten our act together quickly enough...This is something that has stayed with
                    me ever since. Whenever I do a crisis management plan I emphasize over and over
                    that you have to be prepared to handle the press because if you don't you will
                    lose control. And we lost control. The wrong people tried to answer the
                    questions and it was clear that we didn't know what was going on. It gave that
                    impression immediately to the press and we never overcame that all during that
                    day even though we got the right people up there within a relatively short
                    period of time. The damage was already done. The impression among the Washington
                    press corps was that the State Department didn't know what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could you have done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: We should have had a plan that would have prevented just any one of
                    the watch officers taking a call and trying to answer a question based on what
                    they were watching on their television screen back in the Ops Center. Those
                    calls shouldn't have been responded to that way. We should have quickly
                    appointed some one person to deal with the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, too many people were trying to answer and
                        ibecame very obvious that it was an ad hoc response.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Yes. And we were never able to overcome that. Gradually the picture
                    cleared and we knew he was dead and why the embassy wasn't responding any better
                    than it was and people got to work and we got the thing under control. But it
                    was one of those things that started off badly partly due to timing, partly due
                    to lack of planning on our part for unforeseen crises.</p>
                <p>Q: The Secretariat is responsible for tasking all the Bureaus and all with these
                    briefing papers whenever any of the principals go anywhere. This is a tremendous
                    job. The papers have to be done in a certain manner and have to cover every
                    eventuality, etc. At the time you were there, did you consider this a worthwhile
                    exercise? Were these briefing papers used?</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: First of all, the role of the Secretariat depends on the Secretary.
                    Kissinger didn't use it in the way it was intended. Haig did and Shultz did, the
                    two Secretaries I worked for. One was a miliary man and the other was a manager
                    and understood. Kissinger wanted to run things his own way and others have done
                    it differently over the years. So it depends very much on the Secretary what he
                    wants to do with the Secretariat. But when I was there with Jerry Bremer, who
                    was a very strong Executive Secretary, we played a very, very robust role in the
                    Department. One of our prime roles was to insure that papers didn't get to the
                    Secretary that hadn't been reviewed and coordinated with the appropriate
                    bureaus. We were a policing function in that sense. With every new Secretary you
                    have to look at what style he wants, the kind of memo he wants, and then you
                    gradually have to adapt to this style.</p>
                <p>It is a tremendous burden. There are only three people at the top of that
                    pinnacle and one of those three people have seen every paper that goes into the
                    Secretary. We have a whole line, the Secretariat Staff [S/S-S], that reviews
                    those papers before they get up to the Secretariat itself and many papers are
                    kicked back. One of the things you have to watch carefully is that you don't get
                    a director of S/S-S who is a nit picker and tends to over due it and sends
                    papers back for ridiculous things that don't really matter.</p>
                <p>Are the papers read? Yes, they are. Jerry Bremer had Al and me sit down and
                    divide up the world basically, both in terms of geographical areas and
                    functional areas. Papers from those bureaus came to us. I had political/military
                    affairs, EUR...those papers would come to me. Then, of course, the guidance
                    coming out from the Secretary we disseminated, which is the flip side of that.
                    The response of the Secretary was achieved and disseminated by the
                    Secretariat.</p>
                <p>In those days Jerry had the deputy travel with the Secretary. Other executive
                    secretaries have done it differently. If the Secretary was going to Europe, it
                    was my trip from A to Z. I did all of the planning, of course, with ample
                    support from the administrative support people. They were very good people.
                    George Toohey... he is somebody you ought to interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I'll have to look and see if I have an address for him. He was there
                    for so long. Pat Kennedy is another one who would be good to interview for
                    things that went on in the Secretariat.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I will digress for a moment, in that job, the George Toohey and Pat Kennedy jobs,
                    the incumbents, supported everybody who came within the S [Office of the
                    Secretary] area. That included the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, Under
                    Secretaries, ambassadors-at-large. A particularly tough time was when a trip was
                    being planned because we had to do logistical planning, organize the [S/S-S]
                    teams that would go out in advance, plus the substantive papers, plus whatever
                    issues were going on in that particular deputy's responsibilities. So those were
                    really long days. The papers were read and used. Many of them were tasked, some
                    of them were initiated by the bureaus. Those two Secretaries did use the
                    Secretariat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your time going to Haiti as ambassador.
                        How dithat come about and how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I arrived there in mid-December, 1983 and left on the August 1, 1986.
                    I had learned that the State Department's recommended candidate had been turned
                    down by the White House. [The rejection] was not in favor of a political
                    appointee, but something else had caused that. The normal tour of the
                    Secretariat is about two years, that is about all you can take, and that would
                    be in around January 1983. So I went down to see Tom Enders, who was Assistant
                    Secretary for ARA at the time, and asked him what his reaction would be if I
                    threw my hat in the ring for it. Tom's answer was typically Tom Enders, honest
                    and to the point. He said that he had to support his candidate from the Bureau
                    but he would not object. So I was nominated from the Secretariat. When the
                    committee met, which at that time was the Deputy Secretary's committee which
                    hadn't been operating very long consisting of the Director General; Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs, who was Larry Eagleburger at the time;
                    Executive Secretary, who was Jerry Bremer; Assistant Secretary concerned and
                    others. I was selected. I was recommended to the Secretary and my name was sent
                    over to the White House.</p>
                <p>And then began the long wait. [The nomination] went over in March and I didn't
                    get the appointment until November. Senator Percy, who didn't know me from Adam
                    but was running for reelection and was chairman at the time of the Foreign
                    Relations Committee was mad at the White House. At the same time the Republican
                    Party of the State of Illinois had recommended a retired doctor to be ambassador
                    to Haiti who felt that because he was a doctor he could go down and deal with
                    Baby Doc, who was not a doctor. Percy seized this as a way to get more support
                    out of the White House for his campaign and he held up my nomination. He had me
                    up there once to explain to me what the situation was. That it was nothing
                    personal, it was politics. Of course, the White House didn't feel that he had
                    done such a grand job as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee either, so
                    he finally gave way. But it was very disruptive personally. My wife was working
                    and didn't know whether to put in her resignation. She was working with the CIA.
                    And, of course, we had to put our daughter in school and then take her out. It
                    was a very disruptive thing from a personal point of view, but that happens to a
                    lot of us and no one in the Congress particularly cares. It doesn't bother them
                    in the least.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went in December, 1983, how did you bring
                        yourself uto speed on Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: I left the Secretariat almost as soon as my nomination went in and
                    began working both on French, refreshing my French, and getting familiar with
                    the Haitian issues. This was an eye opener because a small country like Haiti
                    barely comes up on the screen in the Secretariat. When you go down to the bureau
                    you find out about all these problems that people are working on that you had no
                    idea about. It was a very active relationship. But I had plenty of time to get
                    on top of the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hit there at a key time, but as you were going and
                        when you arrived, what was the situation in Haiti from the perspective of
                        the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: The situation was that Haiti was sort of stumbling along and had been
                    doing so for some years. It was still the poorest country in the hemisphere and
                    was not improving a great deal. There was only one sector of the economy that
                    was improving and that was what we call the assembling center which was
                    essentially American companies setting up plants to partially assemble things to
                    be brought back to the U.S. for final production. Everybody knows the story of
                    the baseballs, I guess. All of our baseballs, including the pro baseballs, are
                    made in Haiti.</p>
                <p>The problem that we faced immediately was that there was a group on the Hill, not
                    just the Black Caucus, although some of the Black Caucus, Fauntroy in particular
                    was active. There was also a group of staffers over on the House Foreign
                    Relations side who were interested in Haiti and had become active. They had
                    decided that it was time to do something about the human rights situation in
                    Haiti and the lack of any political progress in the sense of movement towards
                    properly elected democratic system. They wrote into the AID legislation...in
                    fact, just as I was leaving to go down there...they wrote in language that was
                    the toughest language I think that existed anywhere at that time. In fact, in
                    talking to the staffers later, I think they were a little aghast at what they
                    had done and realized they had gone a little too far, but it was already there.
                    It called for political parties and certification by the Department of State
                    that there was progress in these directions and human rights in order to
                    continue the AID program. This was put into law just as I was going to Haiti and
                    became the centerpiece the whole time I was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Q: Before you went out did you talk to both the staff members and their
                    principals and say, “What do you mean by this?” There must have been
                    implications there that there was a good possibility that aid would be cut off.
                    Was that acceptable?</p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: It wasn't acceptable to the administration. The administration fought
                    it. Something else had gotten the attention of the administration that year on
                    the aid bill. I forget what it was, but it was bigger than Haiti and nobody
                    notice this until it was too late. They couldn't do anything about it. It
                    slipped through the normal give and take on the aid bill with the staffers and
                    the Congress itself. It caught the administration by surprise. Haiti wasn't the
                    only country that had these certifications. The general position that the
                    administration was taking at that time was that all of these certification
                    requirements were unconstitutional in the sense they tied the hands of the
                    President too much. So the position that the administration was taking was that
                    they were going to fight all of these, Haiti being among them. I didn't think
                    that the administration was going to be successful, so I felt it was incumbent
                    upon me to warn the government of Haiti, Duvalier and his principal ministers,
                    that this legislation was now in effect. In the spring I was going to have to
                    submit a recommended report that would go to the Congress. Even though the
                    administration was not please, the report would have to be taken seriously. My
                    initial courtesy calls turned substantive right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the attitude there was, “Well, the
                        administration ichallenging it so let's not worry about it?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Oh, it varied from minister to minister. Some were outraged by it,
                    some were frightened by it, some were defensive, some were offended by the
                    intrusion into their internal affairs. So you had a variety of reactions. It
                    started my tour in Haiti off on a very interesting foot. Here I was basically
                    coming in telling them they were being challenged to make political improvements
                    or the AID program was going to be cut off. The AID program was the biggest
                    thing in town, not a huge program but big enough to make a difference. It made a
                    difference because other donors tended to follow our lead. Not only other
                    countries like France, Germany, Japan, who had small programs, but it also
                    influenced attitudes of the World Bank and IMF. They were having troubles with
                    the IMF. So it was a serious issue in Port-au-Prince.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were [the Haitians] informed? They were close to
                        the United States. Did they have a good lobbyist? How well informed were
                        they of the real workings of Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>McMANAWAY: That is an interesting question because there is in Haiti, or there
                    was, a group of people who are very well educated, worldly wise, well traveled,
                    well read and who talk as though they understand Washington and the United
                    States, when in fact they don't. They don't really understand it. At that time
                    the foreign minister was a very articulate and erudite gentleman by the name of
                    Estemay, whose father had been president in the forties and we had long debates.
                    He had probably the best grasp of how Washington worked. But even he didn't
                    really fully understand it the way we understand it. The fellow who came to be
                    the minister of economy was very adept at manipulating the IMF and World Bank. I
                    used to tell him that I thought he had magic numbers. I used to kid him a lot
                    because the numbers he used with IMF always seemed to turn out just right. He
                    was quite adept at that. He was French educated, I believe. Estemay had lived
                    here as a young man in exile, as well as in Brussels but he still didn't
                    understand. And, of course, Duvalier had left the island once when he was 18
                    years old about a year before his father died and left him president for life.
                    He went to France for a two-week vacation. That was the only time he had been
                    off the island. He did not finish college and was not a learned man. He was not
                    dumb, but he didn't understand Washington at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the political and economic situation
                        when yoarrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: There are two Haitis. There is Port-au-Prince and the rest of the
                    country. The rest of the country is in pretty dire straits economically as it
                    has been for years. Politically it was like being dropped into some other
                    century. I never quite figured out which century, but not the twentieth. It was
                    court politics, palace politics which young Jean-Claude Duvalier had become
                    quite skillful at. After his marriage, he had stopped traveling in the country
                    the way his father had done and the way he had done prior to that. One of the
                    ways his father had maintained his political base and his power was through what
                    they call a Gromet out in the countryside. In every area there were these people
                    who dominated things and made appointments, etc. It was through connections with
                    those these people and other methods that Francois Duvalier used, and he used
                    everything from voodoo to you name it, to manipulate the people. He was a mad
                    genius at this. Jean-Claude Duvalier gradually stopped doing that, staying in
                    touch with the people in the countryside. So you had a situation where he was
                    concentrating mainly on politics in Port-au-Prince and would deal only
                    occasionally with problems other areas. Most of his attention was on palace
                    politics and the manipulation of the political powers that existed in
                    Port-au-Prince by Duvalier. He did that through appointment of his ministers and
                    letting one particular minister accrue more and more power until he got too much
                    and then he would cut him off and get rid of him. But no one was ever out of
                    favor, socially or politically, because you might need them later on. You might
                    have to bring him back five years from now. There were only so many who were
                    capable of doing the job. You may no longer be able to get your hand in the till
                    directly, if you were no longer a minister, but you are never out of favor
                    socially or politically.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The mulatto class was primarily in commerce. The blacks Haitians were primarily
                    in the military. The government became more of a mixture under Jean-Claude
                    Duvalier than it was under his father. Francois Duvalier had run on the platform
                    of returning power to the blacks. It was supposedly a revolutionary government
                    and Jean-Claude maintained that the revolution was still going on. That,
                    incidentally has a lot to do with our intervention back in 1915. I have just
                    recently written an editorial that is going to appear in the Washington Times
                    Monthly in July against this idea of invading Haiti. One of the things that I
                    point out is that we went in there in 1915 and stayed for 19 years. We sent in
                    southern Marines who were much more comfortable dealing with mulattos. Up until
                    that time the traditional division of power was that the mulattos were good at
                    commerce and the blacks ran the government and military and they fed off of each
                    other. Well, our Marines were much more comfortable dealing with the mulattos so
                    we upended the power structure and put in mulattos in charge of the puppet
                    government. Eventually that gave rise to Francois Duvalier. So our legacy was
                    the Duvalier regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is interesting because back in about 1785 we
                        supported thblacks against the mulattos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McMANAWAY: Jean-Claude had more of a mixture and this was a matter of some
                    grumbling around. It was felt that he needed a better balance. Even in the
                    controlled press at that time you could occasionally see articles about the need
                    for more balance in the cabinet. Gradually he ended up with really only one
                    powerful black, La Fontaine, who was minister of defense and interior at the
                    same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clay, can you tell me a bit about Jean-Claude Duvalier's
                        wife? have the impression that she played a role in how he operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Very much so. The marriage was really the beginning othe end. I think
                    history will show, the beginning of the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain about the marriage and what had
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The marriage was... Let's see. He had been married about five years
                    when I went there. I think that's right. She had lived in the United States. She
                    was the daughter of a middle class coffee grower, merchant who turned out to be
                    an extraordinarily greedy man once he got in the position where he could get his
                    hands into the till and influence things, and he got into everything. He became
                    a real irritant to just about everybody in Haiti. She was very powerful. She
                    attended cabinet meetings. She spoke up at cabinet meetings. Jean-Claude was a
                    somewhat passive guy. He was not a very aggressive man although I think he did
                    maintain the final say. She had his ear and everyone knew that. There was a lot
                    of jockeying on the part of ministers and others to win her favor. There were
                    groups that she favored and groups she didn't favor, and that kind of thing went
                    on quite a bit. She was quite a party girl, too. There were a lot of sort of
                    lurid stories and rumors about their sex life and the partying that went on at
                    the Palace which I never paid much attention to. It didn't affect me. The only
                    time it affected me was the residence. He had a residence... A number of
                    residences, but he had one residence which abutted our ambassador's residence.
                    They would have New Year's eve parties. They would have commercial speakers out
                    there that would keep you awake all night long. The power structure of this
                    class, social structure was... Again the mulattos in commerce, some very wealthy
                    people. I think about one percent of the population had almost all the wealth in
                    the country. I call them the skimmers. They took and they didn't invest in
                    Haiti. They never made any real contribution to Haiti's economic development and
                    I made it a policy not to have much to do with them. I felt that it was not a
                    good signal to give because they were aligned with Duvalier. It was his
                    policies. He was in the position to give them the monopolies they had which
                    enabled them to accumulate the wealth that they had. So they were beholden to
                    him for that and he could change any time he wanted to. It was also his way of
                    taking his cut and accumulating his wealth at the expense of the Haitian people.
                    So I felt that it was not... It would have been unseemly for the American
                    ambassador to be seen socializing with these people</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it this would have been somewhat of a change
                        because wjust normally fell into the company of the resident elite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, I don't want to be critical of anyone in here about my
                    predecessor, but I had been warned that this had become a problem and there had
                    been a lot of that. So I made the decision not to do that. So we turned down a
                    lot of opportunities to go to glamorous parties and ride on glamorous yachts and
                    things like that. I just refused and the word got around very quickly that I was
                    turning these invitations down and they stopped.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the staff you had and what sort of contact... I mean, how did
                    they operate within that society. I'm talking about the embassy staff.</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: It took me about a year to get my country team in shape. The shape I
                    wanted it in. My attach� position was vacant for quite a while. I had to fire my
                    first Agency station chief, and I was able to do that... Is this the kind of
                    thing you want?</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Certainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Because I found out quite by accident that the Agency was trying to
                    send somebody down even before I was confirmed. I was still in the process of
                    being confirmed and then I found out quite by accident that they were sending
                    [somebody] to go down there as station chief. So I put a stop to it. I called
                    out to... Keep in mind now I had had some dealings with the intelligence
                    community during my career. I was with Bill Colby, I was on the intelligence
                    community staff. So I knew people at the Agency personally including the deputy
                    at that time. I had known him before. So I got it stopped. I said: “Nobody 's
                    going down there without my interviewing him.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that the person named represented a
                        policor is it just a generic thing that you wanted to know who was

                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I wanted to know. You see, it was a small political section. I had
                    asked, to give you a sense of what I was thinking about, in view of my state of
                    mind or what I thought might happen. I'm not claiming here any prophesy
                    capabilities or anything like that, but I had asked the historian's office to do
                    a study for me on where there had been change from a totalitarian government to
                    something less than a totalitarian government without violence. They weren't
                    able to find anything. I was looking at legislation and looking at the situation
                    in Haiti and wondering what I might be facing down there. I was trying to get
                    some precedents, get some ideas from history. I knew I was going to need a good
                    station chief because it was a one man station. He had a girl Friday but he was
                    going to be just the one guy so I wanted him to be good. I knew that the Agency
                    had a tendency on places like Haiti to make it a retirement assignment. So I had
                    the guy stopped and I interviewed the guy and I didn't think he was up to the
                    job. This presented a problem because he was partly a native American Indian and
                    part black. So we had a problem, and his girl Friday was black down there. I
                    think to this day she probably believes that I fired him because he was a
                    minority. But I went to John - not John McEnroy... I went to John and I said:
                    “John, I interviewed this fellow and I have my doubts. I 'd like to have your
                    personal opinion, your personal blessing on this fellow that he is somebody who
                    can indeed do the job. Would you look at his file?” He did and he called me and
                    said that he thought he could do the job. I said: “Well, I defer to your
                    judgement, but I'm not persuaded completely and I'll give him six months.” At
                    the end of six months you know, he had not performed well. I had formed this
                    little inner group and we met quite often to review what we were getting into.
                    It was a real team, it was a team effort the whole time I was there. And he
                    simply... In fact, he wasn't respected by the team. It was evident. He tried his
                    best to brown-nose me and he would say things that would turn your stomach,
                    about what people were saying about me I knew were not true. So after six
                    months... I had made a deal with the bureau that I would come back up here every
                    six months because I felt there was a tendency... You know you could get
                    isolated down there because you didn't see traffic from other places and I felt
                    there was a congressional element there that needed tending, that needed to be
                    talked to and that I could do it better than anybody else here. So I struck a
                    deal with the bureau that I'd come back every six months and work the Hill, and
                    work with the executive branch. I came back after six months and went to the
                    Agency and said I wanted him replaced. Having dealt with intelligence people,
                    people in the intelligence community in the past, I sort of knew what words to
                    use and what buttons to push. I said that I had formed this inner circle and
                    that quite frankly he was the laughing stock. Bam, that did it. They couldn't
                    take that. They sent down, to their credit, an excellent young man who performed
                    superbly and thank God I had him. Once the end was in sight for Duvalier, he was
                    invaluable, absolutely invaluable. He did a terrific job. You know, they stopped
                    letting the ambassador choose below the DCM, and I'd chosen my own DCM. He is a
                    man who had been a DCM in a number of places in Africa which I felt was
                    appropriate. I had a very high regard for my first political chief and an
                    equally high regard for my second. Leno Gutierrez was my first. He was Cuban
                    born, raised in the States. Leno has kicked himself, he could have stayed. I
                    said: “You can stay. You can extend.” And he went on and he's kicked himself
                    ever since because he missed the big event. He's kicked himself ever since. Leno
                    did a superb job. We had a very, very good staff. We had a major turnover at the
                    embassy when I went down which was really mismanagement, I felt, on the part of
                    the Department personnel to have that big a change, a complete change over. The
                    consul general was extraordinarily good. I ended up having a very good public
                    affairs officer, Jeff Lite; he was superb. I handled the press through him.
                    During all of this I didn't give any interviews, I stayed away completely from
                    the press and kept Jeff closely informed and did everything through him, through
                    all of this. One time I was, toward the end of it all, I was approached at the
                    airport by a fellow from Time magazine who said: “I just wanted to tell you, by
                    the way, [I admire the way] you handled the press. Very smart.” I've had other
                    people from the press make similar comments. I kept information flying, but they
                    weren't getting in to see me. One time we had like three or four hundred
                    reporters. If I'd given an interview to one, my God I'd have...</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that there had been two factors going in here. One, the
                    military attach� is extremely important because you're talking about the
                    military being a crucial factor in the thing and there has been a long sense of
                    closeness between their military and ours. Maybe I'm wrong on this. And the
                    other thing, there has been a tendency of our military to use a post like that
                    again for retirement purposes. Did you find either of these factors...?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: My military attach� was good. He was not as strong as I would have
                    liked. It turned out that my station chief in the end had the contact that paid
                    off and resulted in a covert meeting with General Namphy's number two. General
                    Namphy was still in the Palace that night dealing with Duvalier and dealing with
                    setting up a government to take over when he left and I had a clandestine
                    meeting with his number two where I put down our demands. The interesting thing
                    was that they didn't understand this business of recognition, so I played that
                    to our advantage, and they came wanting to know what would be required to
                    receive recognition from the U.S. government. So I laid out what would be
                    required and they did everything we asked. But that was arranged by the station
                    chief, not the military attach�, even though it was a brigadier general that
                    came to the residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, say your political officer, was he able to
                        get ouand around in society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Oh, yes. This is a phrase that I want to keep in mind, because I did
                    coin it. Port-au-Prince was a place of no secrets and no truth. Oh, I should
                    mention, I had a very strong economic officer who was very good at contacts. He
                    had an extensive network in the business world and both my political counselors
                    did the same. Even [John Evansworth] was very active socially. When anything
                    looked like it was about to happen or we got a whiff of something coming along,
                    we pulled this team together and I just said: “Hit the streets, go. Be back here
                    at five o'clock and let's compare notes.” I'd be calling on people, you know. We
                    had extensive contacts throughout Port-au-Prince. Later on in other parts of the
                    country. When the country started going up in flames, to be dramatic about it—in
                    fact there were demonstrations in every city except Port-au-Prince—we put people
                    out and we got people up in Gona�ves, and we got people in Cap Haitien who were
                    reporting in. We had some very good intelligence as to what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived there, were things in a state of flux at that time, or did
                    some things start to fall apart as far as Duvalier later on...?</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, in March of '83, the Pope had visited which I think is a marker,
                    is one of several turning points. Because when he left he said: “Change must
                    come to Haiti” in his remarks and the church became much more active. Here's
                    another irony of Haitian history. Francois Duvalier had deliberately set out to
                    get himself excommunicated by the church, which he did. He then renegotiated the
                    concordat, he renegotiated this treaty with Rome, with the Vatican, in which he
                    got the authority to name Haitian bishops and he got rid of all the French,
                    foreign bishops. It was those bishops that turned on his son. His son was faced
                    with a Haitian Catholic church, led by an Italian nuncio, and he and I worked
                    very closely together. But the church became much more active, speaking out
                    about the disparities in the society between the rich and the poor. Gradually
                    about the Palace we had this combination of things taking place, these forces
                    converging on Duvalier. The marriage was resented deeply by the military and by
                    the blacks because she was as white as you are and Duvalier himself is really...
                    would classify as a mulatto, Jean-Claude. His father was black. There was
                    resentment over the marriage. There was growing resentment throughout
                    Port-au-Prince and wherever there were businessmen in Gona�ves or Cape Haitien
                    of her father and his [greed]. It was gross, his corruption, his greed was one
                    of the worst I've ever seen anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His corruption was gross?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. It had to become an ego trip because no one needs that much
                    money. He was bragging all the time about it, [manipulating] foreign currency
                    and... It was outrageous. You had the church speaking out against corruption and
                    making the public increasingly aware of the discrepancies about their way of
                    life and the rich people. And you had the U.S. government bringing pressure to
                    open up the political process and for human rights improvements. These things
                    were all going on at the same time, all this mix began to really become
                    [critical].</p>
                <p>Q: How did you see it when you went out there? You had rather explicit
                    congressional instructions. You understood the climate in the United States when
                    you went out there. What did you see at the end of the road as far as where we
                    were pushing for Haiti to go within your time?</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I decided to try to use, since I really did not have much choice. It
                    was there, it was the law. I didn't have much faith in the administration even
                    though Motley [Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs] was trying along
                    with others. In fact there had been a task force set up I think to try to
                    overturn these conditions on AID that Congress was increasingly imposing in
                    those years. I didn't have much faith that they were going to be successful, so
                    I said: “Let's use it, let's make use of it to see if we can bring some
                    improvements here.” Where that was going to lead I didn't know for sure. I was
                    secretly hopeful without ever saying it to anybody that it would lead to the
                    departure of Duvalier. I didn't have any idea that it would actually happen. The
                    reason for that I thought it would be a good thing is that Haiti has got too
                    many people basically. It's just a fundamental economic problem which is not
                    going to be solved by Haitians. Now I guess they're saying seven million, when I
                    was there six million and on the east end of the island. You got the worst in
                    the island. Two thirds of that island is on an incline of twenty degrees or
                    greater. The trees have been cut down, the land is washing away. It's going to
                    take an international effort to do anything positive about Haiti's economic
                    condition. As long as the name Duvalier was associated with Haiti I didn't think
                    you could get that. I thought if you could get that name away out of here, then
                    you could. And we did start it. As a matter of fact I did start it working
                    behind the scenes, working with the World Bank, working with other donors,
                    trying to get something headed in that direction. But I didn't know what would
                    happen and certainly when it did happen it wasn't just our doing. What happened
                    in the end, it got to the point where if we had a choice. If Duvalier stayed, it
                    would mean the deaths of thousands of people, which would have driven us away
                    from it. The position that we at the embassy took vis-a-vis Washington was:
                    “Let's not wait. Let's not wait until we're forced to pull back. Let's pull back
                    now. He's gone; he's finished.” Mind you this was right toward the very end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually Duvalier left in February of '86. So we're
                        talking about the end of '85?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, December, January. We started taking some deliberate steps which
                    upped the ante and increased the pressure on Duvalier at a time when all the
                    other things were beginning to come to a head. They made some really stupid
                    mistakes which gives you an idea of their state of mind. They being the
                    Duvaliers. They had in May of '85... Well, my first Fourth of July, I
                    invited...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July of '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Of '84, I invited some of the dissidents and the government tried to
                    get me to disinvite them and I refused, so the government boycotted my Fourth of
                    July, and I made a speech which made me a hero on the Hill, you know, an
                    absolute hero. They thought they were doing me in and they were making me a hero
                    back in the Congress. So my tenure there was pretty rocky, it was full of
                    tension a lot of the time. There are a number of different stories that I'm
                    going to tell you. I don't know if we're going to get to them today because I
                    had an experience there which I think is somewhat unique. I don't know if it's
                    unique or not, but unusual certainly. But the mistakes they made in May of
                    '85... They had this huge big party. They invited people in from Paris and all
                    over, a big thing. They gave door prizes and one of the door prizes was a twenty
                    thousand dollar necklace. This was on TV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds a little bit like the Shah's two thousand
                        birthdaparty or something in Iran just before he went down the tubes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. The Foreign Minister's wife won the twenty thousand dollar
                    necklace. This was all on TV and was shown all over Haiti. We couldn't believe
                    it. We couldn't believe they could be that stupid. Later that year, in the fall
                    of that year, they had run into foreign exchange problems again. They couldn't
                    pay their bills and there were gas lines. There was no gas, so you had long gas
                    lines. In the middle of that episode, she flies off to what was billed as a one
                    or two million dollar shopping spree in Paris. Now this was in the context of
                    bishops and priests talking every Sunday talking about this, and gradually it
                    was coming home to people that the general disposition of the Haitians was that
                    they were in the plight they were in because it was God's will. It was fate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're a patient people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. It wasn't the Duvaliers. But gradually they began to associate
                    their situation with Duvalier. It was his fault. And then in December or so
                    there was a shooting. Some students were killed in Gona�ves and it started
                    downhill so fast, it took everybody's breath away. The Duvalier mystique was
                    gone. They were no longer afraid of him and at the same time they were beginning
                    to blame him.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't know what the timing is, save the going downhill for later. But before
                    that before it all blew up, what about relations? What about our aid?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Our aid was increasing. We were able to get increases in our aid
                    program. I got in a new AID director who had served as Deputy AID Director in
                    Ethiopia. He saw immediately that we needed to make strategic changes in the
                    design of the AID program which took a lot of time. I spent a lot of time on it.
                    In other spheres things were going quite well. They did do some things. I'd have
                    to go back and review notes and things to give you specifics and I can do that
                    if you want me to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They did make some moves, both on the human rights fronand on the
                    political front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were able then to basically in all honesty
                        makcertifications that [improvements were made]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, we were able to make certain certifications in my first year
                    there. First year that we had to do it, we had the certification. We were
                    criticized for it,.but we felt justified in making it because there had been
                    some movement. We also renegotiated what had been in effect when I got there and
                    which is now such great controversy was this interdiction agreement which is an
                    international agreement with the Haitians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the boat people leaving and...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. Bilateral. Which gave us and our Coast Guards the right to patrol
                    those waters and return them. It was an agreement, with the national government.
                    We had at that time a requirement from the Justice Department which was a part
                    of that, a program of follow-up interviews with at least twenty-five percent of
                    those returned and within six months after their return to make sure they were
                    not being harassed by the government. We never found any sign of that even under
                    the Duvaliers, any sign of harassment of these people. We negotiated a title
                    three, PL-480 agreement which we had got them into the Caribbean basin mission
                    which was a first for Haiti. Haiti had never been a part of the U.S. sponsored
                    regional AID program. So there was tension and I continued to hammer away on
                    this but we were making progress. What was about to happen though was that he
                    was about to undertake, you know, screw the top off the bottle and couldn't get
                    it back on. After the boycott of my Fourth of July and after... That was a fact,
                    my office director, Rich Brown... I was just teasing him about this the other
                    day. At one point when the Administration was still battling to get these
                    restrictions placed on the AID program by Congress lifted, Motley sent Rich
                    Brown down to rein me in. I was going too far too fast for this business. So I
                    suppose I slowed down a little bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Q: The rationale being that if you started meeting all these requirements it
                    would undercut the Administration's position in a broader sense?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, but it was also causing tension with the government of Haiti and
                    I guess Tony [Motley] felt that let's don't go in that direction because we're
                    going to get it changed. Well, I didn't believe it, was going to happen and it
                    didn't. But I was then approached by the most powerful member of the Cabinet who
                    was the Minister of Defense and of the Interior and said: “We ought to meet with
                    you and the entire Cabinet, and we'll put all the cards on the table and have an
                    honest exchange.” I said: “That's something unusual.” It finally turned out that
                    we had two dinners. One hosted by the Foreign Minister and I hosted the second
                    at the residence. The first was at his home. Basically what they wanted to know
                    was whether I was sent there to get rid of Duvalier, was that my agenda. This
                    was in the fall of '84, somewhere in that area. Since I hadn't been sent there
                    [for that], that was not our policy. What I managed to do... I had my political
                    counselor with me at both meetings and it was quite a performance by this
                    fellow, Lafontant. He always reminded me of one of the major figures in Haitian
                    history, during the fight with [Revolutionary France (Toussaint L'Ouverture)].
                    He always brought this fellow to mind, he was the first fellow who said: “We'll
                    burn down Haiti before we [surrender.]” And he said it to me. He came through
                    during this meeting. Number one, keeping Duvalier in power was essential to
                    these people because it was the basis of their power. This was fundamental and
                    it wasn't going to change. But I was able to let them know that was not U.S.
                    policy without letting up on the pressure which took some doing, but went
                    through the two meetings. First dinner I just sort of listened, so there was
                    still a lot of tension when we started the second one. But when I sort of, in a
                    very carefully worded way, let them know that I wasn't there for that purpose,
                    it was almost physical, you could see the relief. Having come from Vietnam, you
                    know there were rumors about my being CIA and all that sort of thing and in the
                    way I was acting and making some pretty tough demarches they really had got it
                    in their heads that maybe I was there, maybe I had been sent there for that
                    purpose. So we got past that and we made progress with the IMF, we made progress
                    in a number of areas. I think one of the things that I did had a strong effect
                    on future events was I went to them all, including Duvalier himself. I went to
                    his key guys and said: “Look, your constitution says that Duvalier is president
                    for life but it doesn't ban political parties. Why don't you consider having a
                    law that governs political activity and political parties. That started [it].
                    They went for it. The ball started rolling and they brought in people from
                    France to help them write the political law and it was a long story about that
                    evolved over the next year. They did come out with a law that governed political
                    parties and people started forming political parties. The next thing you knew,
                    the press became much more liberal, it just started... And by December of '85 we
                    withheld certification and informed the government we were withholding
                    certification. In saying we weren't going to certify it we delayed it and by the
                    time... I was in Washington at the time arguing for this policy and by the time
                    I got down there in January the whole country was in an uproar.</p>
                <p>Q: Whom were you arguing with who wanted to give certification? Were there forces
                    within the State Department, Congress or anywhere else that basically didn't
                    want to rock the boat?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: There was concern about what the impact would be. It was not that
                    there was a big argument about it. We simply sat around and discussed as a
                    policy issue. How do we deal with this? Do we want to send the signal now. Do we
                    try to certify? That was another problem. Could we certify? With demonstration
                    all over the place, some students having been killed, it would have been very
                    difficult to certify anyway. But we decided that it would be a good political
                    strategy vis-a-vis the government to send that signal that we were delaying it.
                    By somebody saying so, we were sending a signal that we did not approve the way
                    that the government was handling the situation. Because at the time he was still
                    sending out the military against these demonstrators. Later on that ran its
                    course and the military really basically stopped. They refused to shoot
                    Haitians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you talking to the church, the Roman Catholic
                        church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, through the Nuncio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they see things playing out? What were they
                        after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Same way. They saw it exactly the same way. There had to be this
                    change and it was leading to his departure. Or it was going to lead to his
                    departure or a great bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of you thinking how do we get this guy out? What
                        woulour role be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Oh, yes. We were very worried about... There is an incidence in
                    Haitian history that was on my mind very much just before we intervened in 1915.
                    It was the public dismemberment of the president, the crowd tore him apart
                    literally. Sam was his name. I particularly didn't want that to happen on my
                    watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: To the extent that we decided that we would not take him out in the
                    daytime. That we would take him out at night when people were asleep. I was
                    worried about getting him to the airport.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we talk about the actual getting him out there, were you sitting around
                    a few months before telling your people: “You know, we may end up getting this
                    guy out. Did you have a plan?”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We had discussed and it sort of jelled very rapidly. When it started
                    going, it went very, very rapidly. Within a matter of two or three months it was
                    over. He lost his mystique and the demonstrations started, he'd reacted to it.
                    He was increasing... The military was backing away from him and he was turning
                    more and more to the Tontons Macouttes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Tontons Macouttes. Could you explain what they
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, that was the para-military organization that was set up
                    initially by the father, Francois Duvalier as a counter-force to the military.
                    It was not a military organization in the sense of having battalions, etc. But
                    they were all over the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the disguise of dark glasses an?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: That's in “The Comedians,” the movie. No, Jean-Claude changed that. He
                    made them into the Volunteers for National Security and gave them a uniform.
                    They had blue uniforms. They were thugs. Not all of them were thugs. Some of
                    them were your cousins out in the countryside. Some people joined to survive.
                    And that's one of the things that's so wrong right now and people don't realize
                    it. Those people are back in control. We can knock off the military with a
                    reinforced company but that's not the point. What do you do after that? You can
                    back in there and you assume responsibility for Haiti's future and why on earth
                    should we do that?</p>
                <p>Q: Let's cut if off now, don't you think? I'm just looking at the time. Let's
                    talk about when we pick this up the next time, about essentially what we keep
                    referring to. How things played out as far as the overthrow of Duvalier. What we
                    were doing, what you were doing? How we saw it, how Washington reacted? Also
                    something I didn't ask before but that may be covered, the role of the Black
                    Caucus within Congress, how did this play?...Not necessarily at that time but
                    all throughout your time, was this an important factor or not? Did you have to
                    be concerned about that equivalent to the ethnic community, the black power
                    group? Okay?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Okay.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is December 13, 1994. Clay, you heard what I said on the last interview,
                    I think we're in Haiti. We've more or less talked up to the fall. Why don't you
                    cover about the Black Caucus first and then let's move to how the situation
                    played out with the overthrow of Duvalier?</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The Black Caucus played a role but in fact the individuawho played the
                    most important role was Fauntroy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is his first name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Walter E. Fauntroy who is the [democratic] delegate from the District
                    of Columbia, a non-voting member. He became very interested. And some of the
                    staffers of the appropriations committee on the House side were very keen on
                    Haiti. As a matter of fact I met with them repeatedly on my [trips back to
                    Washington].</p>
                <p>[Note: portion of tape inaudible]</p>
                <p>[Congress] had written conditions into the AID legislation, including formation
                    of political parties, and I think everybody felt that they had gone too far. But
                    there it was, it was in there and as it turned out we later made very good use
                    of that in pressuring for change in Haiti. Fauntroy visited quite often and took
                    a very keen interest in Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would go see Duvalier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: He would go see Duvalier, but not very often. He would see others. He
                    would see a lot of the dissenters, he would see some of the opposition, he would
                    see some of the people who would do things on the human rights side. He would
                    see a lot of the clergy. Fauntroy is a reverend himself, a preacher. He came out
                    of the civil rights movement and he would make speeches there, press conferences
                    there and here. He was quite active, traveled throughout Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find him useful in sort of getting across the
                        concern othe American political establishment or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, he certainly complemented what the Administration would say. He
                    was not well-liked by Haitians certainly not the Duvalierists, nor the Duvalier
                    government, but Haitians in general do not like African-Americans I guess you
                    would call them now. They don't like them coming down telling them how to do
                    things because they don't see Afro-Americans as being particularly successful.
                    After all, the Haitians in their eyes overthrew their slave masters. It's been
                    downhill ever since, but in their eyes, they don't like black Americans to come
                    down there and tell them what to do. The converse of that is that I think Haiti
                    is an embarrassment to black politicians, American politicians, the Black
                    Caucus. And it was the Black Caucus which was very instrumental in driving
                    President Clinton into this current policy of intervention. He allowed them to
                    make it into a domestic political issue rather an international or foreign
                    policy issue. Even at the end though they sort of split, the Caucus did, as I
                    understand it. They weren't unanimous about the intervention even though they
                    had put so much pressure on it and given Aristide so much support that it became
                    inevitable.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking now in say December 1994 where earlier in the year the United
                    States put on tremendous pressure and actually sent troops into Haiti which are
                    there now as we speak to restore the government of Aristide. The situation is
                    still in flux. How did the situation play out with Duvalier. Why don't we start
                    with how the situation was falling apart?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We'll have to go back a bit to understand the forces that were at
                    work. It wasn't falling apart when I went down there although the seeds had been
                    sown already by the Pope's visit in March of 1983. I went down there in December
                    of '83. The Pope on his departure in his speech, his statement when he left,
                    said change must come to Haiti. From that the catholic church became much more
                    active. The international press was much more active in raising the
                    consciousness of the Haitian people about the corruption in government, about
                    the disparity between their lives and the life of Duvalier. At the same time we
                    were putting quite a lot of pressure on Duvalier to change.</p>
                <p>My relationship with the Duvalier government stayed correct but tense the whole
                    time I was there to the point where I guess it was my first or second July
                    Fourth reception I invited some of the opposition, some of the people who were
                    pushing for human rights, some of the people who had spoken out and they asked
                    me to disinvite one or two and I refused. And then the government boycotted my
                    Fourth of July reception. I went ahead with it and made my speech to no response
                    and they made me a hero on the Hill. They didn't realize what... Then they made
                    some very huge mistakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask something about the role of the CIA. Was there
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: No. No problem at all. We had a very good station chief. He was part
                    of my inner group. There were four, five of us that met, worked this problem. I
                    used all the resources I had there. He was very useful as a contact. We were
                    approached by the Tontons Macouttes leadership. We were approached by an
                    old-line Duvalierist who had been out of power for a long time. We were
                    approached by everybody. They all knew it was crumbling and they were stepping
                    forth to see what they could do with it. They wanted to work with us. I was
                    sending messages and finally was asked directly... Let me back up a minute, it
                    gets more complicated because somewhere along in this time period, the Prime
                    Minister of Jamaica had in his cabinet a fellow who knew the Duvaliers
                    personally. So he sent him over to Port au Prince and I was seeing someone over
                    at the airport and he arrived by pure chance and he came running over to me and
                    he said: “You're the American ambassador.” I said: “Yes.” And he said: “I've got
                    to see you, I've got to see you. What's going to happen? When can I see you?” So
                    we met clandestinely and we talked on the phone. He was there for a few days and
                    he was helpful. I used him to send messages to Duvalier. I used every avenue
                    that was going to Duvalier. Everybody who was seeing Duvalier and it was sort of
                    the same thing. “You've got to go.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the message by this time (We're talking, I guess,
                        about lat'85) “Get out!” or “You've got to make major reforms!”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, we still favored major reforms. I didn't have the green light
                    from Washington to take it any further at that point. We did have, again
                    fortuitously, a chief of missions conference in Miami in January. I didn't know
                    it but the [Assistant Secretary (Elliot Abrams)] had a meeting on a [previous]
                    Saturday of all wise men on Haiti who were in Washington, and they had come out
                    of the meeting which said: “Don't underestimate Duvalier's staying power.” I'd
                    had a session with my team and we wrote up a memorandum of recommendations and I
                    carried it with me. It had the endorsement of the entire country team which was
                    a hundred and eighty degrees out from [the wise man's advice]. And to his
                    credit, he came around very quickly to the point of view that it was inevitable
                    that the choice for Duvalier was, “Kill a lot of people in order to stay, or
                    leave.” If we didn't back away, you know, distance ourselves from it, we were
                    going to be associated with that slaughter. We needed to convince him to leave
                    because if he started slaughtering a lot of people, we'd have to move away from
                    him anyway. To his credit he came around very quickly overnight and I got my
                    marching orders and I was able to be much more forceful when I went back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who came around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Elliot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elliot Abrams</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Who had come down and basically he had been receiving
                        ansaying: “Well, Duvalier is going to stay in there for a long time</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. “Don't underestimate his staying power.” But we met with his
                    various lieutenants and discussed it at some length and decided we would take a
                    more aggressive stance. We would move to distance ourselves from Duvalier even
                    further. So I was going to go back with a much stronger hand and at that point
                    started passing the message that I began forcing the conversation on to options.
                    What were his options? This gentleman, Solomon, was a brave man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. His wife was dying of cancer at the time. He was walking through
                    the dark corridors and he didn't know if he was going to get out of there alive.
                    They had crazy ideas. They wanted go to the UN with this and he had to stop
                    that; they couldn't do that. So a lot of his advice was most unwelcome. He came
                    by one day and asked me, this was early one morning and he said: “The president
                    wants to know what you think?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at this point saying: “You know, if you want to
                        go we'lhelp you get out? How was this put?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Very subtly but clearly enough. One of our nightmares was that Port-
                    au-Prince would go up in flames. We were also worried about all the Americans
                    living there, about five or six thousand Americans all over Haiti. We had hooked
                    into a ham radio network where we could keep people informed throughout the
                    country on what was going on. They could stay in touch. We had a round the clock
                    task force going. Of course the schools were closed. A lot of people had
                    left.</p>
                <p>Q: Just giving the nuts and bolts, you really saw this as an inflammable
                    situation in the Caribbean where things at least were near our resources. Were
                    U.S. military forces alerted for an evacuation?</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Oh, yes. In fact we had some people from the military there. A couple
                    of guys had been in earlier and had done their usual surveys for evacuation.
                    They came in... The Department had sent in a satellite (TACSET) secure radio. I
                    had one of those on my desk. In fact the Executive Secretary got upset with
                    Elliot and me because we were doing so much of our business on TACSET. There
                    were very few cables being sent back and forth. We were on that radio
                    constantly, back and forth. For once, we had called it right because definitely
                    he was going to go. I was in lunch and got [the] word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: February 6th, 1986. I was in lunch down in a little snack bar we had
                    at the Embassy and I got word that the Foreign Minister was on the phone and
                    went up... I remember leaving my ham sandwich lying on my desk. He said: “Would
                    you please come to the Palace right away?” My DCM insisted on going with me for
                    my protection, but they wouldn't let him in the room when I went in to see
                    Duvalier. As I arrived at the Palace immediately in front of me was the French
                    ambassador. He preceded my car, in his car. He went in and saw Duvalier, then I
                    went in. He made a little speech. The Foreign Minister was there. He made a
                    little speech about what was good for the country and he was going to make this
                    sacrifice to save lives and he wanted to leave as soon as possible. He wanted to
                    leave that night. Could I get him a plane? Without any authorization I said
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you said without authorization, we were saying we'd
                        help higet out...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We didn't have anything arranged. We didn't have any policies,
                    statements, any directions from Washington that said: “We will do it.” I had
                    asked for a number of things. We had put on standby some jets out of Florida to
                    come do a fly-over if we needed - Haitians are terrified of airplanes for some
                    reason - to fly over Port-au-Prince, not to invade or anything like that. It
                    never even occurred to us. Our concern was getting him out alive without a real
                    horrible massacre of him and his family. If people found out he was headed to
                    the airport, why, [who knew what could happen]? Trying to do it in the daytime
                    would have been foolhardy. So Washington responded. The military responded. We
                    had a C-141. It arrived I think about two o'clock in the morning. I told them
                    they could take two suitcases each, that was all. They wanted to take
                    everything. I said I needed a list of what they were taking with them.</p>
                <p>I congratulated [Duvalier] on his decision, etc. I'm leaving out a number of
                    things. I wasn't prepared to give this much detail because we had one mishap
                    where we thought at one point during all this activity going on, he declared a
                    state of emergency. I was working very closely with the Nuncio at this time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Papal Nuncio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The Papal Nuncio. All during this period. We had a meeting that night,
                    on one particular night. The town was just rolling with rumors. People were
                    calling, coming to the residence. Something's happening, something's going on.
                    He's been captured by the military, he's in jail, this, that... It was just
                    wild. My DCM decided he was going to go down to the Embassy and he was there
                    alone when this broadcast came on, very early in the morning on the radio. It
                    was a radio broadcast which said that he had left. The operations center in the
                    State Department got wind of something going on down there and called about that
                    time. My DCM said: “No, we've just heard on the radio that he's left.” Well that
                    was immediately send off to the White House and somehow got to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the spokesman for the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They were on Air Force One and he made this announcement which of
                    course was false. Then Duvalier... I think it actually helped in the long run.
                    Then Shultz went on Good Morning America and we scripted him to say the right
                    things. He knew what to say of course. By then he'd been following it. He wasn't
                    directly engaged but he was following it. He was kept closely informed and he
                    was asked the question whether we supported Duvalier and he said: “We support
                    popularly elected governments.” Well I was besieged with questions immediately
                    coming from the Palace. “What does that mean?” “It means what it says.” But I
                    used that to very good effect. The Jamaican was there at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, it was interesting. The C-141 landed. I thoughit was going to
                    wake up the entire city. It was huge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A big four-engine jet. It's one of our biggest transit

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: It reversed the engines when it landed. I thought it was going to wake
                    up everybody. At one point we got word that one of the networks had the story
                    and was going to go with it, so we got the phones cut off. We were working with
                    the military at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Haitian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They got the phones cut off so that people in the States couldn't call
                    and tell people in Haiti what was going on. We had a two-hour window. The plane
                    could only stay on the ground for two hours. We used that entire two hours to
                    get [Duvalier's] entourage out there. I think the plane left at three
                    forty-five, or something like that, that morning. We had set up liaison with him
                    and with the military, General Namphy, but we lost track of him. Nobody was
                    answering the phone at the Palace. All I could think of, having been in Vietnam,
                    was [when Diem] had been killed. I was thinking: “Oh, my God, they've taken him
                    off somewhere and shot him. Got to find him.” So I woke up the Foreign Minister
                    about three times in that early morning hour through to three o'clock and do you
                    know what they were doing? They were partying at the Palace, going-away party.
                    Plus he was handing out part of his weapons to the Tontons Macouttes right up to
                    the last minute. But they finally arrived out there. Washington decided that we
                    should have somebody on the plane, so we put a young lady Foreign Service
                    officer on the plane. The French were not happy about them going there, but by
                    then they couldn't do anything about it and they took off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then, what happened, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I met, before he left, at the residence clandestinely with a Brigadier
                    General, an envoy from Namphy. This was set up by my station chief. We went
                    upstairs at the residence, at night, I forget what time it was. He wanted to
                    know what it would take for us to recognize the new regime, not realizing that
                    we don't do that anymore. So I laid it out, what they needed to do. There had to
                    be elections, and do this, and this, and this, for a move toward democracy,
                    establishment, honoring international treaties and all these things. General
                    Namphy came on the television the next morning and announced all these things,
                    they were all there. Everything I gave him was in the speech. They had formed
                    this council to govern until there could be elections. And I began working with
                    Namphy directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How sincere did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Very sincere. Secretary Shultz also came down before I left and had a
                    long meeting with Namphy. Namphy was, I think, very sincere from the outset. I
                    don't know what happened. I never have quite figured out what happened. Namphy
                    was a stubborn man. I had a four-hour meeting with him. He spoke French with me.
                    He had a slight speech impediment. I had a splitting headache, but I'd meet with
                    him almost everyday. I could turn him. It would take time, but if he was heading
                    off in the wrong direction I could turn him around. Then I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when? MCMANAWAY: I left August 1st, 1986.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: Just to give some idea how something operates, you knew what we wanted but
                    your proposals to Namphy, were these coming from you or was there a game plan or
                    you were just told the goals over there and you figured out how to get
                    there?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, that's pretty much it. A lot of it... You meaafter Duvalier
                    left?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Duvalier left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, I worked with Namphy in setting up a cabinet. I talked him into
                    putting several people there. He was going to make the military attach� here in
                    Washington as ambassador. I said: “You can't do that. You can't send a military
                    officer off as ambassador, from the military. He represented almost a military
                    regime. You don't want a civilian on your council but you can't do that. He
                    would get exasperated. He said: “Where am I going to find anybody after
                    twenty-eight years who is not a Duvalierist?” And I gave him the list, talked to
                    him on the week-end. I called him and we went over the list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you get the list?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We made it up from the collective wisdom in the Embassy. And he'd
                    start reading down the list and he'd say: “No, no, he's not family, no, can't...
                    Then finally I'd hit one and he said: “Ah, good idea, he's family, okay!” And
                    that person became ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say family...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: He meant you know, part of the... People he could trust. That was one
                    of his big problems, was finding people he could trust. But you want to save the
                    rest of this heap to the next time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the addition about the timing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Or anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or we can keep on. How's your time, do you have more
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I have a little bit more time.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we keep on. In the first place during this post-Duvalier period, how
                    did you treat things like the army, the Tontons Macouttes and all that?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, the Tontons Macouttes were being disarmed. One of the things we
                    were worried about was that the way the Duvaliers had run things, they had three
                    battalions. The chief of staff, Namphy, was really not in command of the
                    military. He was off to one side, an administrative officer. The commanders all
                    reported to the president directly. They didn't socialize with each other, they
                    weren't allowed to. We didn't know whether they would work together or not.
                    Whether they could work together. While the Tontons Macouttes was not a military
                    organization, it was very big. It was even bigger than we thought. When they got
                    into the Minister of the Interior and found the files, the numbers were
                    staggering, including messengers. Over three hundred thousand men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: But they were spread out. There was no organization. It was not
                    organized like the military, except in Port-au-Prince you had the real hard
                    core, about two thousand . The whole military counting everybody was only about
                    seventy-five hundred. And that's fire trucks, police, etc. So we were concerned
                    about whether the military could hold together... Well they did. They almost had
                    a pitched battle in Port-au-Prince, and the Tontons Macouttes backed down. Then
                    they sort of started disappearing. Of course the people started attacking them
                    as well, killing them where they could. Out in the countryside they just sort of
                    melted away. One thing about the countryside, the Tontons Macouttes were
                    probably your uncle or your cousin.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this... I'm using the wrong term but more a social organization, you know.
                    If you were a member of the Tontons Macouttes, were you getting a salary? How
                    was it...?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: No, it was basically... They lived off the land, so tspeak. They were
                    powerful, they had the power to do a lot of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a mafia-type thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They were open, not undercover. They were called the national
                    volunteers or something like that. They had uniforms. But you could go into some
                    of the most remote places in Haiti and suddenly, boom, there would be a Tontons
                    Macouttes wanting your name and who you are and what you're doing there. Not
                    secretly, but openly. But they were his balance of power from the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this post-flight period, did our military get closer to
                        thHaitian military and started beefing it up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We tried. We tried like hell. Because one of the things we felt that
                    Namphy needed to be able to do... He kept asking, kept asking, kept asking... He
                    said: “You know I've got to do something with the army. Can't you help me get
                    some barracks. I want a medical program for the army. But you know, I couldn't
                    get it through Congress. That was an area I think where we let him down. We
                    couldn't get the money for the military in appreciable amounts to give him a
                    strong hand with the military. Our military came down to do surveys of their
                    requirements, their needs, etc. We tried, but the Congress just would not go
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? Was there a feeling that the military per se...? Was
                        thia post-Vietnam reaction, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They didn't trust. They didn't trust them. We tried to point out to
                    them they had no training in riot control, crowd control or any of that. They
                    didn't have any instruments like rubber bullets, they had very little tear gas,
                    you know, for crowd control stuff. We were afraid they would misuse it. Congress
                    was afraid they would misuse it so we had a lot of trouble getting anything
                    through. We got some.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a feeling that when Duvalier left, interest within the political
                    apparatus back in Washington fell off. I mean, this was taken care off and now
                    to move on to other countries?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: No, no. Not in the administration and not among the people who'd been
                    following Haiti up on the Hill. No, it didn't. Everybody was holding their
                    breath. I was working very hard with Namphy to... We had some back-and-forth
                    about how long it would take to have an election. I thought five years would be
                    a good time period. Certainly no sooner than three years. Washington was pushing
                    very hard for eighteen months. The Administration felt that Congress wouldn't
                    stand for any longer, and Namphy surprised me by coming out with eighteen, I
                    think it was eighteen...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clay, the two names, I think, General Cedras and Aristide,
                        diany of these come across your radar at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Aristide did. As I was leaving he was emerging as a very vocal
                    liberation theology priest and one the Vatican was worried about and was trying
                    to move him out of Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what “liberation theology” was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, it is: overthrowing a government is justified on the grounds of
                    religion. The church was very worried about him and wanted to move him out of
                    Haiti. They weren't able to do so. He was emerging then with some very varying
                    speeches, or sermons I guess, I've forgotten the right term. Their Sunday
                    morning homilies. They were firebrand stuff. He also... We didn't know then that
                    he was a little wacky as well. He was just emerging when I left.</p>
                <p>Q: When you left Haiti... You know, as you leave what did you think. You'd been
                    so immersed in things what did you think when you left? Whither Haiti?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, the Secretary had me in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Shultz?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Mr. Shultz. For a chat when I got back and he said: “What are the
                    chances?” And I said: “Fifty-fifty.” I may have said less than fifty-fifty. He
                    was a little startled, he thought... “Well, you're saying it's not going to
                    work?” And I said: “No, no. It could but there's a long way to go.” They'd never
                    had it. They don't know what's democracy. To most Haitians democracy is license,
                    to do what you want to do. It would include getting revenge. They have memories
                    that go back... Things that had been done to them. It's a sad place. They can be
                    very gracious people and they deserve better leadership than they've had since
                    they beat the French, they and yellow fever. They defeated the French. They
                    haven't had it. I don't know what happened to Namphy. Namphy was a drinker. I
                    guess two months after he'd taken over he had to go take a rest. His doctor
                    ordered him to take some rest. They were working very hard. They're not used to
                    working those kinds of hours. They'd never had to work like that in their lives.
                    Here they were faced with running a government. He had to take some time off,
                    and he took a rest period. After I left I heard that he went back to the bottle.
                    I don't know whether it's true or not.</p>
                <p>Q: Just for somebody who wants to get a little feel, in the short term, in the
                    next couple of years. Basically were the election held in eighteen months?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: They did hold the elections and they were aborted. During the voting,
                    as the voting started, there were attacks on the voting places. People were
                    killed and the election was aborted by the military. Namphy, from what I could
                    tell, sort of let it happen. He didn't... There were some bad guys around him.
                    Again I'd have to refresh my memory on some of these names and I think they
                    basically took over running things. I got the impression, I wasn't there. I
                    wasn't really able to follow it that closely. I wasn't reading the cable traffic
                    and certainly not to notice. But I think a lot of people saw it coming. Our
                    embassy didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who replaced you as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Brunson McKinley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Brunson had served, I believe, mainly in Europe and hahad one tour in
                    China.</p>
                <p>Q: I want to get a little bit how our system works. Here is a place which has
                    just gone through a critical phase and is obviously still up there. We don't
                    know where it's going or what's happening. Did you have much of a chance to
                    brief him? Was there much bringing him up to speed before he arrived?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I made myself completely available to him and did as much as I could.
                    He was well briefed. He had been selected before the overthrow of Duvalier. He
                    had been the seventh floor's candidate. He replaced me as Deputy Executive
                    Secretary. We had a very short overlap there. It was the first time I'd met him.
                    Then he was the seventh floor nominee. I think Abrams felt he had no choice but
                    to leave him. He had been selected before the fall of Duvalier. You know the
                    Department, how long this process takes. He was not selected with the situation
                    in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably a good place to stop would be about here. Do you
                        havsome more time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Not today I'm afraid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain just how you got your next assignment
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I don't know if we want to get into that or not.</p>
                <p>Q: Well what we'll do, is the next time, you'll fill in a bit the details of the
                    day Duvalier left. And also then we'll pick up starting about your problems with
                    Elliot Abrams and all, about getting involved with the Nicaraguan situation and
                    a job there which proved abortive for you. Then we'll move on to your time as (a
                    counter terrorist?) Okay?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Okay.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is March 9, 1995. As we said last time, we got Duvalier off the ground
                    and what happened after he left, the day after. Then we'll move on to other
                    things.</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Did we get him off the ground? I don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we didn't get him off the ground, but we were
                        havintrouble, he was partying or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Oh yes, he was in the Palace, we couldn't find him. woke up the
                    Foreign Minister two or three times during the night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can always cut this out if we've already... Don't worry
                        abouthat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We had a liaison by then with the military. We had a colonel who was
                    with him and supposedly performing liaison with us. When we couldn't find him I
                    was reminded of the situation in Saigon when Diem was killed. We had to send out
                    a major to collect him from where he was hiding in the Chinese part of town,
                    Cholon. The major lost his head on the way back and killed him and Ngu his
                    brother-in-law in the van on the way back. It was not intended at all and I had
                    visions of [the same thing].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd be known as Mr. Assassin or something. “Don't send

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The guy we sent was someone we weren't all that sure oand...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a Haitian colonel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. We had about a two-hour window when the military aircraft could
                    stay and then it had to leave and we were getting very close to the end of that
                    window when they finally showed up. The mother came out first, showed up at the
                    airport. I had sent a team out there. We had unusual luck in the team that I
                    had. I had as part of the military detachment there was a sergeant who was a
                    C-141 cargo master.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: C-141 being the type of aircraft we had.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: And my DCM was a former Marine, Steve Doggins. And I had a Coast Guard
                    fellow who was a pilot, and we put him in the tower at the airport to talk to
                    the plane's pilot coming in and going out. And there was a fourth, I'm trying to
                    think who the fourth was. We also at Washington's request put a young female
                    officer on the plane to go with them. I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about that,
                    but Washington thought we should do this and we did. But finally they showed up
                    with about fifteen minutes to spare I think, maybe a little bit more. Then they
                    loaded up. We had limited them to two bags each. The plane took off at close to
                    four o'clock in the morning, at three forty-five I think. It sounded like... You
                    could hear it for miles, huge racket. Since it was taking off in the dead of
                    night I thought surely it would wake up every Haitian in the country, but
                    nothing happened. Then General Namphy went on TV. I had met with his envoy to me
                    that night and he wanted to know what it would take for the U.S. to recognize
                    the government. I laid down our standards of requirements and he spelled them
                    all out in his speech. They were all covered in his speech: elections, he would
                    return to civilian elected rule and meet international obligations, and all
                    those things. They were all spelled out in his speech to the people on TV the
                    next morning. Namphy had a call-in of the whole diplomatic corps later that day
                    around noon and gave the usual assurances that you get in such situations. Then
                    he met, wanted to meet separately with me, and we talked about meeting later and
                    how we were going to proceed. From then on I met with him almost daily. It was
                    quite a sensation driving down to the Palace that day. The crowds were in the
                    streets waving the American flags and palm fronds as a sign of peace. That was
                    one of the few times I flew my flags.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you whether... On the ambassadorial car
                        mosof the time one doesn't want to fly the flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: A few times I did and drew the cheers everywhere all the way to the
                    Palace. It was quite a sensation. It was a very happy day for our government.
                    Then we went forward working with Namphy to form his cabinet. We had quite an
                    influence on that. I may have mentioned previously some of the things that we
                    did. We pretty well suggested his minister of the economy, his minister of
                    finance. I dissuaded him from sending a colonel to Washington as military
                    attach�. I said he couldn't do that, he couldn't have a military... Not an
                    attach�, it was an ambassador. I said he couldn't do that. He said: “Well I
                    can't find any people who aren't supporters of Duvalier, Duvalierists.” So I
                    came up with a list and he picked one out. As a matter of fact, it was a
                    grandson or a great-grandson of a former president, Pierre Sam, and he sent him
                    as ambassador. We proceeded on a number of fronts with regard to policies,
                    programs, and headed toward elections over the following months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your replacement was already on track at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, he had already been nominated, decided upon anyway, at least
                    within the State Department, he'd been decided upon which I learned when I
                    returned on consultation shortly after.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how close were you, sitting down there “Why don't you pick this guy as a
                    minister of economics and don't do the ambassador.” Was this coming out of you,
                    or were you...?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: That was coming out of me.</p>
                <p>Q: That's what I thought. How did Washington, particularly the State
                    Department...? Did they give you your head or was there a problem, running down
                    there to see what was happening?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: No, they pretty much gave me my head. The one area where we had some
                    debate was how long before they could have elections. I thought they should have
                    more time. I was thinking if we could possibly do it, three to five years. They
                    were pressing for elections much sooner, eighteen months which is what Namphy
                    finally did. That was the one area of disagreement. Other than that they pretty
                    much gave me my head. I would not call interference at all.</p>
                <p>Q: Going back to you, this thing came to a satisfactory conclusion, at least as
                    you, at this particular point in time, were concerned. Your successor had been
                    put on track. It was time for you to leave. What happened?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: It wasn't until... You see, Duvalier left in earlFebruary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: February '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: February '86. I didn't leave until August, 1st of August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really had quite a bit of time for what we would
                        calnation building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You feel a little bit better about this than you did in
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Oh yes. We were encouraged by Namphy. Secretary Shultz found him to be
                    a person that he had some confidence in. It didn't turn out that way, and I've
                    never, never really quite understood what happened except that he didn't have a
                    lot of stamina. He was a drinker and apparently he did go back to drinking. I
                    think he was manipulated by some of the people around him, but I've never been
                    able to determine exactly, what happened to Namphy, why he failed. He did. We
                    didn't think he would. We thought he was capable. The one area of concern I had
                    about Namphy was his extreme dislike and distrust of Haitian politicians. He
                    would not talk to them. He wouldn't do a lot of things initially. It took a lot
                    of long, long meetings I had with him. I'd have four-hour meetings with him. I
                    got him to turn around on a number of things, but that's one I never did
                    succeed, to deal with politicians. So I was worried about that.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say you had these meetings, I mean you're thAmerican ambassador and
                    here is the president of a country. Was this your role? I mean turned into an
                    advisor's role?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Very much so. I met with him very frequently and we talked about lots
                    of things, about how he was governing and things that needed to be done. He
                    asked for things, he asked for one thing we failed as a government to respond to
                    I think probably because of concerns about congressional attitudes. He needed
                    support for the military and he wasn't looking for lethal weapons or things like
                    that. He was looking for things like barracks, places for them to live. He
                    needed the army support. I could never persuade Washington to come up with the
                    funds and [equipment] that could make a difference. I don't know whether that
                    had anything to do with the eventual failure of Namphy or not. I can't say. It's
                    conceivable that he lost support of the army. He knew and he was pretty
                    desperate about it, that he needed to produce something for the army who in fact
                    had stepped in and taken over and had pulled back from following Duvalier's
                    orders at the end, of killing Haitians. We weren't able to deliver on that, not
                    in any meaningful way. But yes, I was pretty close, not close in the sense that
                    we were dealing with each other very frequently. These very long meetings which
                    I always left with a splitting headache. He had a speech impediment and it was
                    all in French. It took a lot of perseverance and a lot of time. But I had gained
                    his trust and he would listen, do things that he didn't really want to, but he
                    did it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when your term ran out there. What happened
                        as far as your progress, as far as your personal career went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Abrams had asked me to earlier... He was Assistant Secretary for the
                    region. He had asked me to come back and run the Nicaraguan program. At that
                    point the Congress was considering this hundred million dollar request and it
                    looked like it was about to be approved. I had reluctantly said I would consider
                    it. Then Shultz came down virtually the last day I was there, just before I
                    left, he came for a visit. He was visiting other places and he included Haiti.
                    He met with Namphy and of course I was riding around with him in my car, the
                    ambassador's car and he asked about it. Well, that pretty well... You know, you
                    never can say no to the Secretary of State. So I went back to Washington to go
                    in and run this program which I found was flawed from the very beginning. The
                    legislation was flawed. It gave responsibility to the State Department but gave
                    money to the CIA and I thought it was going to be very hard to monitor, even to
                    know what the CIA was doing with the money. I expressed my concerns and had a
                    lot of questions. I made one trip down to Central America with Abrams and [a
                    representative] of the CIA who was quite rude, really didn't want to deal with
                    me. One of the theories I heard later was that it was really the CIA which
                    didn't want me in that job. You see I had fired a station chief. I don't know if
                    I covered that or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Fired the first station chief. And I had worked in the intelligence
                    community, so I knew how they worked. I wrote out a number of questions for
                    Elliot and made some suggestions. He wanted me to run this program really
                    without any staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well there was this hundred million dollars given bCongress to support
                    the Contras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: In Nicaragua, yes. I had a number of questions about what we were
                    trying to do. Whether we were trying to build up the military [side] or trying
                    to support an insurgency. There's a lot of difference, and I pointed out that I
                    knew the difference because I'd spent five years working with an insurgency in
                    Vietnam. Anyway, he wanted me to run this thing by myself basically out of the
                    office of Central American Affairs. I said that wasn't possible. Just wasn't
                    possible alone and I laid out what I would need. I'd need at least a small staff
                    and a reporting mechanism tied in to the embassies to know at least what the
                    agency was doing otherwise we would be blind. Next thing I knew Elliot had gone
                    to the Secretary and had said that he didn't think I was the right person for
                    the job. That I wanted to do it a certain way that he didn't want it done. The
                    Secretary was not happy I'm told about that. You know, he said: “You're telling
                    me that McManaway is not the man for the job? You're wrong. What are you going
                    to do for McManaway?” Of course he didn't do anything. I had never really wanted
                    the job to begin with so I wasn't terribly unhappy about it. Elliot called me in
                    and said he thought it would be better to have someone else. Then he asked me to
                    give him a memorandum on how I would do it, which I did, and he followed it
                    almost to the letter, and brought in someone else to do that. [Jerry Bremer]
                    heard that I wasn't going to do that. He had taken over the ambassador-at-large
                    [for Anti-Terrorism Affairs] and asked me to join him and I did. So I left. My
                    feeling was that Elliot had heeded the Agency and said... Elliot was trying very
                    hard to have a smooth, even relationship, cooperative relationship with the
                    Agency which I didn't think was possible. I thought you had to, shall we say,
                    create a tension there otherwise... I know the Agency. They'll come to the table
                    and tell you everything you want to hear and then they'll go off and do what
                    they want to. We were going to have to have some way of checking what they were
                    doing. So either because of the [objection from] the CIA or because he felt I
                    wasn't with the program because I had so many questions about it, whatever the
                    reason, he decided he didn't want me for that job. I wasn't displeased with that
                    outcome because I didn't think we knew what we were doing and the more I got
                    into it the more I felt that way, thought that way. So that's how I ended up
                    back over with Jerry Bremer once again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Well, actually I didn't go over there until '87. I spent from August
                    till the end of the year... I had minor surgery and I was out for a while. So I
                    started sometime in early '87.</p>
                <p>Q: Elliot Abrams was a controversial figure. Certainly he was taking much of the

                    Contras. What were you getting from [his people]? You were involved in going
                    down and talking to the embassy desk people. How was he viewed by the people
                    working with Central America within the State Department as far as you can
                    gather?</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: As far as I can gather is that he had [their] support there. [I didn't
                    detect any] lack of respect. He was a very bright man and quite able to take the
                    heat. He didn't seem to deal well with people who questioned... you know
                    substantive questions. They were not meant to be questions of, you know, [coming
                    from some] kind of disloyalty or anything like that. But he didn't seem to
                    handle those sort of things very well. I didn't detect any lack of support.
                    Quite on the contrary, he had good support from the people working with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Counter-terrorism from '87 to '88, what are you talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I was there from '87 to '89, when I left. So it was a little over two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the bureau? What were its concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: The bureau?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Counter-terrorism, was that a bureau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: No. It was an ambassador-at-large reporting back to the Secretary of
                    State. The Department had floundered for quite a few years on how to deal with
                    this subject of counter-terrorism, where to put the organization, how to
                    organize what. How it should be managed. It was in M [Office of the Under
                    Secretary for Management] for a while, it reported to D [Office of the Deputy
                    Secretary] for a while, it was back to M. It was finally decided to have an
                    office under the Secretary. It was S/CT. That had occurred in the fall of, or
                    slightly before Jerry went in there. Jerry went in in October 1986 and he was
                    reporting directly to the Secretary. He was attending the Secretary's morning
                    staff meetings, etc. He had direct access which really made a big difference. It
                    really made a huge difference in the ability to do the job because it is a
                    single-issue office and you went to deal with a bureau, the geographic bureau,
                    you were dealing with people who had multiple concerns in the individual
                    country. We were a pest. We were just trouble makers. We would go in there
                    telling them “You've got to do this, you've got to do that.” We were looking
                    only at one issue so we couldn't go to the bathroom without getting into a
                    bureaucratic fight. Fighting all the time, trench warfare, constantly.
                    Particularly with the Near East bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose some of the major threats were probably Syria
                        anLibya, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Syria, Libya, Iran, and Lebanon of course where we had all the
                    hostages. We had most of our dealings with the folks in the Near East bureau and
                    they were pretty stormy. One of the first major issues that I can recall getting
                    engaged in was the issue of returning our ambassador to Syria. You'll recall the
                    terrorist who was supported by Syria. In fact he was using a Syrian passport,
                    not a [full diplomatic] passport, they'd have something just short of a
                    [diplomatic] passport. He was in one of those. He used a diplomatic passport to
                    get the materials for his bombs into London trying to blow up the El-Al flight
                    and they caught him. He was using this woman, his girlfriend. He had duped her
                    into carrying this bomb onto the plane and the Israeli security had caught her.
                    At that time England, the UK, broke relations with Syria and in support we
                    withdrew our ambassador. The bureau wanted to return him. They were very
                    uncomfortable not having an ambassador there. We were very much opposed until...
                    Our position was that the ANO, which was the terrorist organization Abu Nidal
                    Organization, until they ejected him, or did something to him, and that took
                    months to accomplish. But finally they did, finally the Syrian government kicked
                    him out. He went to Libya and at that point our ambassador was returned to
                    resume this wonderful dialogue we supposedly had with Assad. Of course there was
                    no such dialogue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It continues today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Anyway that was one of the major battles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose with Iran, this would have been in the hands of
                        the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: One of the things that perhaps I should take a minute to explain.
                    There had been a decision, I guess an NSC decision to give the responsibility
                    for coordinating the United States government's counter-terrorism policies and
                    responses to international terrorist incidents to the StatDepartment. For
                    domestic instances, it was the Justice Department, the FBI was the action arm of
                    the Justice Department. The whole effort was an intensely inter-agency, one of
                    the most intense inter-agency operations I 've been involved in, and I've been
                    involved in a number of them. We had the CIA, the FBI, the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff. Finally, we brought in the Justice Department later on, at the
                    Secretary's insistence; [the Defense Department]. All of those agencies were
                    involved daily and weekly in forming policies, or responding to incidents, or
                    trying to track down terrorists, and of course [dealing with] the hostage
                    situation. Also we were recovering from the setback of the Iran contra-incident.
                    The only country which hasn't stumbled on this issue of hostages, the only two
                    countries were Kuwait and the UK. Everyone else has stubbed their toe on that
                    combination of dealing with terrorists over hostages, as we did during the
                    Iran-Contra affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, pretty much were you all agreed
                        about hoone deals with hostage situations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, there was a good, uniform consensus among thdifferent
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is essentially “Don't deal,” isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Don't Deal. You can talk, but don't deal. That's one thing we ran into
                    all the time, people not really understanding what we were saying when we said
                    we don't negotiate. What we were saying was not that you don't communicate. In
                    some way you try to communicate, but you don't cut any deal, you're [not making]
                    concessions. That was widely supported among all the agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Iran-Contra thing had blown up by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: It was over by this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this serving as a strong lesson? Don't let amateurs
                        get in?Does this serve as a worse-case example of what happens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, but because Iran-Contra created the image we were negotiating
                    with hostage-takers, it took a while to recover from that, dealing with other
                    countries like France in particular, to convince them that [we really did mean
                    it]. We didn't want them making concessions either. That was one of the things
                    that we worked on quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find that the NSC was duly chastened on this type
                        othing? Because the Iran- Contra thing had been run out of the NSC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. That was the one agency I forgot to mention was was listing. The
                    NSC was involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume that having received this very bloody nose,

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, they were very careful and very supportive not doing anything
                    like that again. One of the things we were able to do was... We snatched a
                    terrorist and pulled it off. We had seven agencies involved. It took us months
                    to plan it and pull it off. We lured the terrorist out of Lebanon into
                    international waters and snatched him. We brought him back to the United States
                    and tried him. He is in jail. One of the things we patted ourselves on the back
                    for, we felt that we'd proven that you can do it without doing it the North way.
                    You could do it within the system.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes. You could do it within the system. You didn't havto go outside
                    the system. We were able to pull that off without a leak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that seem to have made an impression on the

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I think so. It's hard to say. You can't get inside the [system]. It's
                    very hard to penetrate these organizations. I would have to assume that it did.
                    I can't say for certain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Libya? At this time we didn't have
                        diplomatirelations then did we, but we had some Americans there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: There were some Americans there but you were not supposed to be
                    traveling there, nor were you supposed to be traveling to Lebanon at that time.
                    Libya, Qadhafi had [pulled back] by that time, because of the raid on
                    Libya...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a bombing raid which narrowly missed Qadhafi

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: He pretty well kept his head down and has since then. He's worked
                    through surrogates. Some of his people of course are now saying he's involved in
                    the [Pan Am 103 bombing]. I have my own theory about that, but I was not there
                    at the end of that investigation. I'd left before they had... When I was there
                    they were on a different track. The investigation was turning in a different
                    direction and it shifted only after I left. So I don't know, I don't have access
                    to all—except what you see in the papers—as to how that shifted, and Libya
                    having been involved. The changes that have been made in the State Department
                    since that period have been really [major].</p>

                <p>MCMANAWAY: It loses clout within the Department, it loses within the U.S.
                    government. It loses clout internationally. When we traveled, either Jerry or Al
                    Adams or I traveled... Because we all had the title of ambassador but we all
                    would be working at the level that...We'd call on ministers when we were abroad,
                    visited foreign countries. At the [current] level, I don't believe they can do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there - we're talking about '87 to
                        '89 - what was the prime motivation of these various terrorist groups or
                        were there various ones that we were concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: You know terrorists are looking to make a political point, trying to
                    damage U.S. interests wherever they can. Of course with television the way it is
                    now... For example, the Kuwaiti [Airbus] highjacking took place within that time
                    frame. We were not directly all that involved but there was one American on
                    board. No one knew that. We only knew it because before switching and using an
                    Egyptian passport as he caught the flight out of Bangkok, he had shown them an
                    American passport, so we had found out that he had an American passport. He did
                    not show it on the plane to the highjackers. So they did not know it and we were
                    very careful not to let anybody else know it. We knew it and we were very
                    interested and were following it. We followed it overseeing it as well as we did
                    through the television agencies because they were right there, they had better
                    booms, they had better equipment. They were everywhere the flight was so we
                    literally followed it on CNN. So they get a huge audience for whatever message
                    they want to get across. In that case they wanted seventeen colleagues released
                    by Kuwait. They had been jailed for terrorist acts in Kuwait.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: One of the seventeen terrorists that were held was ifact the

                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: There are several factions within Hezbollah. Hezbollah was largely

                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Japan was not a big player. I made one trip out there. They were not a
                    big player in the counter-terrorist... Of course they have a reputation for
                    paying off. When they have people kidnapped, they pay off. Therefore they have
                    more people kidnapped. Usually big businessmen and the companies pay off right
                    away. France's support varied with the administration that was in. The current
                    interior minister was also interior minister during the latter part of the time
                    I was there, Pasqual. He was very supportive.</p>

                <p>MCMANAWAY: But he was very supportive. And they were very supportive of Spain
                    because in Spain there is a terrorist group who crossed over for safe haven into
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some Basque type things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Basque type thing. They were very supportive in helping Spain and they
                    got a number of the top guys and they were very helpful there. They were very
                    supportive in the international forum which we met on account of terrorism
                    during that time. Other times, you know, France for a long time had a policy of
                    laissez-faire, if you like. As long as you didn't do anything on French
                    territory, the French wouldn't do anything against the terrorists. So their
                    policy is not consistent. It's been somewhat inconsistent. The UK was always
                    very supportive. Italy was very supportive, Spain...</p>

                <p>MCMANAWAY: Germany was pretty good. In fact the Germans picked up one of the
                    principal terrorists involved in the highjacking of the ship “Achille Lauro.” We
                    tried to get that fellow extradited to the States but they refused. But they
                    tried him in Germany and the FBI did a lot of work on that, provided a lot of
                    evidence and witnesses at that trial. Greece was pretty hopeless. We tricked
                    Greece. There was one terrorist... After we snatched this one guy whose name
                    escapes me, maybe it will come back. Eunice was the guy's name. We got him out
                    of Lebanon. We told him he was going on a big drug deal. He was going to make a
                    lot of money. The Agency had the contact with him. Lured him out. How much of
                    this can we get into I don't know. It's already been made public. They had got a
                    hold of a yacht and had it stationed out there, in Cyprus. Of course it was
                    manned by a CIA agent, a girl, a female of the agency in bikini, etc. They were
                    just out beyond the border, in international waters. Took him out there in a
                    speedboat and once aboard he was clapped and he was arrested, then took him to a
                    navy ship which then took him to an aircraft carrier and we put him on a plane
                    and we flew him on back nonstop. It took about three refuelings, broke several
                    records of flights off an aircraft carrier which I guess we'll never get into
                    the record books, but... After we'd done that we had been tracing and following
                    another terrorist who had been involved in the bombing of an American plane some
                    years before in which a teenager was killed. We knew he was in Sudan and we were
                    planning an operation. We were having a lot of trouble with the lawyers because
                    this time we were going to go into a country and take him. We had a pretty good
                    plan, but then we found out he was going to be traveling, and he was going
                    through Athens. So we notified the Greek authorities that there was going to be
                    somebody going through on false documentation. Only after the arrest did we tell
                    them who he was. Because if we had told them before, they probably wouldn't have
                    let him in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served four years in Greece and we had a terrorist
                        attack. We had a bombing of a TWA plane there and the Greeks' whole idea
                        was: “Get him out. We just don't want to deal with this problem.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We didn't try to get him extradited. Again they trieto... He's in jail
                    and that was all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get him out? Did the Greeks finally,
                        usinpublicity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We didn't get him out. They tried him in there.</p>
                <p>Q: It's easy in a way to deal with the Arab terrorist, but all of a sudden we get
                    into a politically sensitive thing like the IRA. The IRA very obviously are
                    terrorists of the first water, but at the same time there's still an Irish
                    heritage. This is a Kennedy talking to a McManaway. Was there a problem, an
                    internal political problem in dealing with the IRA?</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Not very often. You know we were supportive of the UK. It was really a
                    UK problem. They weren't really killing any Americans. Terrorist activities that
                    don't involve Americans, we didn't get involved in. The only problems we had
                    were with some of the spokespersons for the IRA who wanted to come to the United
                    States. You'd get into some bureaucratic squabbles over that. We were able to
                    block one or two times one of the fellows who's since been let in. But that's
                    about the only connection we [had]. We did get involved a little bit in
                    providing intelligence of Libyan shipments of munitions and weapons and stuff to
                    the IRA. We didn't get too much involved.</p>
                <p>Q: By the time, when you left a new administration had come in 1989 which would
                    have been the Bush administration and you retired at that point. Looking back on
                    it all, one, on the counterterrorism, what was your impression of how our
                    efforts had been at that time?</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: I thought we'd done pretty well. We had improved international support
                    which is obviously an international problem. We had made a couple of dents in
                    their several organizations. We had disrupted the ANO pretty badly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ANO is...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Abu Nidal Organization, one of the worst of all the terrorist
                    organizations. We had improved significantly efforts against states who had been
                    supportive and who were supporting terrorist groups. We had improved our
                    capabilities to track and identify them, and track them down and keep them off
                    balance. I thought we'd done pretty good. We had very strong support from George
                    Shultz. Bush of course had got involved in counter-terrorism when he was
                    vice-president, so we had good support from his staff. It was really running
                    well. We had a couple of inter-agency organizations. One was a big organization,
                    I'd have to go back and count them. Lots of agencies involved. That group got
                    involved in some of overt policies and activities that we did such as supporting
                    the government of South Korea during the Olympics, the government of Canada
                    during the Olympics in Calgary. But we didn't rely on that. The real group that
                    really made policy and made decisions was a small group that met over at the
                    NSC, and we had a very strict rule. There were no notes, minutes taken. It was
                    gloves off. We said whatever we thought. One agency would tear into another and
                    it just cleared the air. We had a rule that only one principal from any agency
                    could attend the meeting. So we kept very small and that's where we planned the
                    snatch of Eunice, that's where we planned a lot of different...</p>
                <p>Q: Also by not having too many people, it kept people from posturing for their
                    own staff and all that which is always a problem when you have a large...</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: That's true. And unlike the anti-drug organization, they never had
                    anything like that to my knowledge and they've never been able to get a really
                    good coordination. But we had that inter-agency coordination and it was really
                    humming. It was going on extremely well. My impression is that on the
                    Busby...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Morris Busby...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, it must have worked very well because of the job they did prior
                    to the war in the Persian Gulf on Iraq I thought was just super...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well they certainly buttoned up Iraq as far as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Just super job. They got, I forgot the number, I think it was two or
                    three hundred so-called diplomats PNG all around the world. They blocked an
                    operation in one country that I know of that would have been spectacular, and
                    they pulled it off. They did a super job. It seems to me it's gone downhill
                    since then, but it was going well. We'd done a good job particularly in our
                    agency's side. We had done some very tough things. I spent nine months
                    negotiating a treaty on what would happen if we sent... We had an inter-agency
                    response capability which extended to the military. What would happen in any
                    given country between the American ambassador and the Commanding Officer of the
                    unit that went in there. How that would work and when the Command would (shift
                    over when it would shift back.?). It took me nine months but it's probably
                    gathering dust on some shelf somewhere now.</p>
                <p>Q: But still this is an important thing because you had a little bit of this
                    happen down in Sigonella, Sicily prior to your time when they'd picked up the
                    Achille Lauro.</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: Yes, a little bit of it?</p>
                <p>Q: There was a big confrontation there, from the Italians, the Americans who
                    snatched the highjackers, and the American authorities in Italy. That was I
                    guess the instigation.</p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We were still suffering from that with regard to our dealings with
                    Italy all during the time I was involved. We also worked out understandings on
                    debriefing of hostages. Who was in the lead, how to handle that? We did a lot of
                    things. We ran a lot of exercises. If we'd ever been called on to respond I
                    think we would have done quite well.</p>
                <p>Q: One of things I think you really have to deal with this. Every agency if they
                    have their choice really wants to be paramount and they run in and it all looks
                    unplanned. We end up looking stupid because of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: We also end up missing opportunities and messing up situations. But it
                    also stems from legitimate interests and concerns. For example, you always have
                    this tension between the FBI and the CIA, because the CIA is interested in
                    intelligence. The FBI is interested in evidence and you don't disseminate
                    evidence, you keep that. You're going to have to use it in court. They're
                    trained that way, they've lived that for twenty-five years. It's just ingrained
                    in them. So sharing is just unheard of. Breaking that down, making sure that we
                    did get evidence that we might need if we ever were going to prosecute anybody,
                    at the same time not miss any tactical intelligence. Of course the military are
                    interested in an entirely different thing. For example debriefing hostages,
                    trying to figure out where they were held and how you get in there if you ever
                    get a chance to go in and try to rescue hostages. Which way does the door open.
                    They want to know all that stuff. They all have legitimate interests and
                    concerns, so reconciling that is not an easy job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: State of course is concerned about the sensibilities of
                        thcountry where it happens...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCMANAWAY: But also making sure that we're staying in the league and our
                    responsibility was coordinating all this. We got a lot of that done which hadn't
                    been done before. For one thing, the period just prior to Bremer taking over and
                    Al Adams and I joining them had been a horrific time. There were just one
                    incident after another. Bob Oakley was there and Parker Borg were there that
                    previous year, that year of 1985. I've forgotten how many incidents there were.
                    You had highjackings and... Those poor guys were just running from one crisis to
                    another. So a lot of the stuff couldn't be... There just wasn't time. Before
                    that, it wasn't well organized within the State Department. It wasn't put
                    together right to do any of these things. So it was really the first chance
                    anybody had to tackle some of these things. I don't know what's happened to
                    them.</p>

                <p>MCMANAWAY: A management consulting firm. An international management consulting
                    firm. We specialize in investigations of all kinds, fairly sophisticated stuff.
                    We have a lot of former senior government officials who know how to run
                    undercover operations, sting operations. It's all new to me but it's... Not all,
                    but a lot of it was new to me which was fun. We also work on security
                    matters.</p>
