                <p>Q: Today is the 25th of September 1998. This is an interview with Myron B.
                    Kratzer. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                    and Training. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. To start at the beginning, tell me
                    when and where you were born and something about your family.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: I was born in New York City, literally in the city in Manhattan in 1925.
                    My father was a traveling salesman, which meant that, in those days, he was gone
                    for weeks at a time because his territory was in Oklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas,
                    and he was on the train all the time. So in 1929 when I was four - it was kind
                    of a fateful year, of course - we moved from New York, which I really never got
                    to know, obviously, to Oklahoma because of the family. I grew up in Oklahoma and
                    went to high school there. I started at sixteen at the University of Oklahoma in
                    1941, another kind of fateful year, so I was not that close to military
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back just a touch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in elementary, high school - in the first
                        place,were you part of a larger family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I had an older brother, six years older. Although we were close, we
                    weren't that close at that age. My father traveled all week long so we saw him
                    on weekends only, but it was a close family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your mother was a homemaker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: My mother was a homemaker. In those days there were nothat many working
                    wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving over to 1929, would you call yourself a child of
                        thDepression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, fortunately, I guess - certainly fortunately - my father was never
                    unemployed. We were by no means well off but never unemployed. As a traveling
                    salesman, I guess in those days, it was a fairly comfortable living. We
                    eventually - I think about 1940, or so - had enough funds to buy a house. Until
                    then we were in middle-class neighborhoods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What line of goods was your father selling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: He sold ladies underwear for a well-known firm, which I think still
                    exists, called Kaiser. The household was always full of the samples stacked from
                    floor to ceiling. That's kind of a staple and, therefore...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I attended elementary, junior high, and high school iTulsa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I was single-mindedly interested in science. Well, I shouldn't say
                    single- mindedly because - I don't think I am kidding myself - I was interested
                    in school in every subject, especially foreign languages and what was called
                    social studies in those days. I was a terrible athlete and, when the kids chose
                    their teams, I was the last to be chosen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the feeling. Ha. Ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Scholastically, I guess I was pretty much at the top of the list in all
                    these schools and subjects. I skipped a grade in elementary school, and I guess
                    I skipped another grade, so I skipped a grade and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sort of threw you out of the social spin, didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Not really. No. No. Somehow I never had the feeling that I was, though
                    my classmates were a year and a half older. I never had that feeling. We are
                    Jewish, and I think that makes a difference in the sense that, in those days in
                    particular in a medium size town like Tulsa, your friends tended to be not so
                    much people of your exact age or even of your class, but the other Jewish kids
                    you met in Sunday School and related activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family practicing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Moderately. We were very reformed but we went to services from time to
                    time at religious holidays. Not devout, but very committed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Jewish community in Tulsa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes, there were probably two to three hundred families, two
                    congregations, and a lot of people of considerable wealth because of the oil
                    industry. We were not favored by that but there was no division on economic
                    grounds. It was a very tight knit community, very generous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? What sort of things did you read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, looking back on it, I didn't read what would normally be
                    considered classics. I read science books, not deep science at that age, but
                    books about scientists and about science. There was a series of books called Tom
                    Swift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Tom Swift and his electric submarine!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I read all those, and a little more general literature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about classic works such as Astounding Science
                        Fiction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No. I didn't read those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good heavens! Not even the science fiction of the Pope
                        Fiction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No, I never read a science fiction book or much less the classics like
                    H. G. Welles. I'm not even sure I knew he existed in those days. I was very
                    interested in science, and I read science biographies and books like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you ever stopped to analyze what brought you towards
                        science?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, my brother who was six years older had begun - again on his own -
                    studying engineering at Oklahoma University. He was good in science. But I don't
                    really think that was it. We weren't that close. I just loved it. That's it. I
                    had a chemistry set, and that was my major hobby, and a little bit of electrical
                    things but not as much as kids today have. Math was very easy for me so, since I
                    was a lousy athlete and a good math student, there was never any doubt in my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of science were you getting in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, we had chemistry but I don't recall having biology. I think in
                    junior high we had a general science course that included some biology. I
                    remember looking at things under microscopes and so on but biology in those
                    days, in my memory at least, was not what it is now. It didn't sound very
                    scientific. It wasn't quantitative, and I was drawn to quantitative things. I
                    was drawn to chemistry more than anything else. I loved physics, too, but
                    chemistry was what drew me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated from high school at sixteen in
                        1941?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes, I started school at Oklahoma University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Oklahoma University like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It was a good school, looking back on it. I think the instruction was
                    really - of course, I don't have a basis for comparison - serious and first
                    class. There was socializing but not to the exclusion of studies. There were
                    fraternities, and I was in one. In those days, fraternities were very, very much
                    segregated. Of course, Oklahoma was a Jim Crow state so that there were no
                    minorities, no Black students at all. I was there long before that changed.
                    There were two Jewish fraternities and maybe 20 or 30 non-Jewish, and I was in
                    one of the two Jewish fraternities. It was a matter of pride - almost of
                    necessity - that we win the scholarship cup every year, which we did. I thought
                    it was a good school in instructional terms. Whether it did much in the way of
                    research, I wasn't conscious of.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would have thought that with petroleum being so important - and that
                    means chemistry, I would think - there would be a mutual attraction.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Petroleum engineering was a strong point as far as national reputation
                    was concerned. My brother graduated in petroleum engineering. I was never drawn
                    to it. I was interested in it because everyone in Oklahoma was interested in oil
                    in those days. I wanted something more technical than petroleum engineering
                    impressed me.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major? Was it chemistry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Chemical engineering. That was a line I drew in my mind because I
                    thought that, as a chemist, about all you could do was teach school, which I
                    didn't want to do. There was no serious effort at counseling in those days. I
                    never saw a counselor. I think, in hindsight, I had a lot of invalid ideas about
                    what you could do with science, where it might lead, and the like. To me,
                    chemistry was something that didn't have much of a future. You would just end up
                    as a school teacher. As a chemical engineer, you had a chance to end up doing
                    things and creating things, and that's what I chose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you finish college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Having started at sixteen, I was close to the end of my second year when
                    I became eighteen. Of course I registered for the draft at eighteen but there
                    was no immediate pressure to be drafted. I saw a notice that the Army Air Corps
                    was looking for students with two years of college to become weather officers.
                    They would be, if selected, inducted into the army and sent to one of six or
                    seven major universities that were training army air corps weather officers. I
                    think Chicago was one, Cal Tech was one, and probably M.I.T. Meteorology had a
                    very limited availability as a curriculum in the U.S. in those days. Most of the
                    advanced meteorologists came out of the Scandinavian countries. In any event, I
                    signed up for that and, in a short time, I was selected. I joined the Army
                    voluntarily as an enlisted person about a month after I was eighteen with a
                    letter in hand that would have sent me to an Army Air Corps weather school. I
                    was sent to basic training in California in preparation for that. It turned out
                    that somebody had really sold the Army a bill of goods. They were in the process
                    of training enough weather officers for the next century, if they lived long
                    enough! By the time I got into and out of basic training, the program had shut
                    down and, instead, there was something called the Army Specialized Training
                    Program, which was made available to us as a sort of substitute for the weather
                    school that I expected to go to. I just moved almost naturally into the ASTP,
                    Army Specialized Training Program, and was sent to Ohio State University to
                    continue chemical engineering, which I had left only a few months before. I
                    continued that from the fall of 1943. I went into the Army in March of 1943 and
                    went into the basic training and a month of doing nothing and just a holding
                    pattern at Stanford, which was very pleasant. I was then sent to chemical
                    engineering at Ohio State; that would have been in the fall of 1943. In the
                    spring, probably April or May - Ohio State had the quarter system, so it didn't
                    fit in with most - this course was not quite completed. There was still one
                    quarter left to go, and we were all subjected to a series of interviews, which
                    we didn't know the purpose of. At the end of it, we were told - we were a group
                    of about 30 - with one or two exceptions, which are easily explained at a later
                    date - that we had been selected for the Manhattan Project, which we had never
                    heard of. We were sent by train one night to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which wasn't
                    on the map, and interviewed further. The group was split into about half, and
                    half of it was sent by train with one GI who had the orders to Los Alamos near
                    Santa Fe. The other half stayed at Oak Ridge. That's how I got started. At that
                    point, I guess it's fair to say that I had probably two-thirds to three-quarters
                    of my chemical engineering education behind me. I hadn't completed it, so I
                    wasn't a college graduate but I had most of the basic math and physics. It took
                    me a year to complete my bachelor's when I returned to college later.</p>

                <p>KRATZER: From the early summer, probably June, of 1944, as a GI, as were most of
                    the technical staff at Los Alamos. Obviously, with one or two exceptions, the
                    GIs were at the bottom of the totem pole. Numerically, most of the technical
                    staff at Los Alamos were GIs like myself, not officers. They were chosen largely
                    from various schools, not all from Ohio State. I was there as a GI until being
                    discharged in March of 1946. At that point there was never any doubt what my
                    next move would be. It was to return to school to complete my work and get my
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere at Los Alamos when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It was amazing. It was full of enthusiasm, expectation, and hard work,
                    and quite a lot of fun in the sense of people getting together for
                    entertainment. It was closed but not as closed as some of the accounts have it.
                    We could leave it but we couldn't go home. We could go down to Santa Fe. We were
                    a common sight on the streets of Santa Fe, about 25 miles away. The logical
                    question, is did we know what we were doing? The answer is that we did. We
                    couldn't have done the jobs that we had if we hadn't known what they were about.
                    There was perhaps a battle that you read of from some of the accounts between
                    Oppenheimer and the military authorities as to whether the junior staff should
                    have access. He (Oppenheimer) clearly won, so that certainly I knew what I was
                    doing and what the project was for. We were all informed from within a week of
                    getting up there and getting assigned to a job. This was kind of funny itself
                    because I kept saying I wanted to do chemical engineering. It wasn't the place,
                    in senior staff's view, where any chemical engineering was being done, but they
                    scratched their heads and came up with a job that really was in the category of
                    chemical engineering. It was part of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Division. It
                    was directly connected with - if you want me to take the time, I'll tell you
                    what it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: If the test, called Trinity, had not worked, then the plutonium that was
                    to be used in it would have been essentially all the plutonium in the world at
                    that date, at least in the United States, and of incalculable value. Our job was
                    to come up with a system to recover it. This involved initially a great big
                    pressure vessel. The test was to be conducted in a pressure vessel, which if
                    there had been no nuclear explosion, would have contained the explosion of the
                    high explosive. We would then go in and dissolve out the stuff plastered on the
                    walls and recover all the plutonium. At a later date, they decided not to do it
                    in a pressure vessel for a lot of scientific and other reasons but on a tower
                    instead. That would have involved us going in and sweeping up the desert floor
                    and recovering what plutonium we could, which would have been far less but still
                    worthwhile. That was the job that our small group of chemical people, headed by
                    civilian scientists from the University of California, had. It wasn't weapons
                    design per se but it depended on knowing what the project was all about. There
                    was to be a nuclear explosion, and it wasn't known what the consequences of that
                    would be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Oppenheimer or General
                        Groves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, yes. It was a small enough operation so that obviously I - well,
                    you could hardly say that we were personal friends - saw them. Groves wasn't
                    there full time but he was back and forth, and he was normally quite visible. He
                    was a big man and made a point of being visible, even to the extent of visiting
                    the barracks where all the GIs lived. Oppenheimer was around all the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: The thing that sticks in my mind is - I don't think my memory is playing
                    tricks on m- I guess it took about a week after I got assigned to a group to
                    have it explained to me what the project was about. I had a GI buddy who was in
                    a different group who was going through a similar experience. He explained what
                    his job was, and I said when this is over, when we do it and have it - and I
                    don't think anyone ever doubted its success - the war will be over in a week. I
                    think I was off by three or four days. I also really felt that, naively, - as my
                    training in history and that sort of thing was hardly extensive - it would end
                    war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It has ended a certain type of war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to going there, had you been aware of the literature
                        abouheavy water? This was not a big secret.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It was Sunday Supplement material. I recalled, after the project was
                    explained to me, that I had read the Sunday Supplements about atom splitting,
                    which was a common term in those days. I certainly must have read about atom
                    splitting, and probably about nuclear fission. Fission was not a word that was
                    on the tip of my tongue, so I can't be sure about how much I already knew. I
                    remember being asked by my boss, who was a fine guy, “What do you know about
                    uranium?” I said, “Well, it's radioactive.” He said, “That's true but that's not
                    what we're interested in.” My first reaction was not the right one. I didn't
                    say, “Well, it's capable of releasing large amounts of energy.” No, I didn't say
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: I had four years as a GI myself in the Korean War. Here, obviously, are a
                    bunch of bright enlisted men brought together. What kind of atmosphere was
                    there? What were you all doing?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KRATZER: There was lots of excitement and lots of enthusiasm but it wasn't at the
                    military level. We didn't consciously reject anything military. It just wasn't
                    part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was a language specialist as a GI. The military was
                        there buit really didn't play much of a role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: In my group of six or eight people - and to some extent, but not
                    exclusively, your friends tended to be those you work with - the group leader
                    was a Ph.D. chemist. We were certainly all under 30. Two or three other
                    civilians and, at various times, probably two or three GIs - one of whom was a
                    classmate from Ohio State - went through the same process that I did. We were
                    good friends but not to the exclusion of other people. My closest friend was in
                    a completely different group but he had also come through the same process. He
                    was also one of the chemical engineering students at Ohio State and got assigned
                    to a different group, but we continued to be close friends. When we had time
                    off, we would get together and go into Santa Fe. The excitement of seeing the
                    top people was great. Fermi was there frequently, along with many other top
                    scientists, and we rapidly knew who was who. Looking back on it, the job I had
                    was where I wanted to be but it was not really in the main stream of bomb
                    design. My contact with people in that category was really just seeing them on
                    the streets and, occasionally, in lectures, when they gave some that were open
                    to the technical staff as a whole. I remember hearinNils Bohr lecture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teller?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Oh, yes, Teller as well. These were exciting times.</p>
                <p>Q: Did politics intrude? I am thinking of, obviously, the Soviet Union. Was this
                    something that was bandied about, I mean were we all pals of the Soviet
                    Union?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, this is very interesting and a good question. I'll tell you
                    something that has frequently come to my mind over the years. To put it in
                    context - because at the time it had no meaning whatsoever - one of the people
                    in my barracks, probably no further than 15 feet from me, was David Greenglass.
                    Well, you know who he was.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. Would you explain who he was? KRATZER: Greenglass was one of the
                    people tried and convicted for espionage for transferring secrets to the
                    Soviets. He was the brother of Ethel Rosenberg, who in turn was the wife of
                    Julius Rosenberg. They were both executed for espionage after the war. I didn't
                    know him personally, but I knew him by sight. I probably said hello to him. I am
                    sure that he was sort of a loner. I would say he was an odd duck. Unlike most of
                    the people in that particular barracks, I don't think he had any college
                    education at all. He was a machinist. In addition to the technical staff, there
                    was obviously a need for people who ran machinery and performed tap and dye
                    work. They didn't have any intellectual input. They were given drawings, and
                    they made the parts that they were told to make. He was in that group, and that
                    was a little unusual because most of that group came later and were in other
                    barracks. The barracks held about 100 people each. At the end of the project, I
                    imagine there were probably close to a thousand GIs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about the typical two-story barracks with the
                        big bay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Even one-story ones. There were maybe 100 people per barracks, and there
                    were maybe five or six or possibly more of these barracks. Most were the purely
                    technician types that came later. I was in either the first or second barracks.
                    We were among the earliest GI arrivals. But, yes, we had occasional security
                    lectures. Of course, we also probably had VD [venereal disease] lectures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sure of that. Ha. Ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It wasn't heavy handed but certainly more than once - I can't remember
                    the number of times - we would have a security lecture by an officer. The
                    officers, by and large, were not among the technical staff, although there were
                    a few because of the training that they had had. Because of the education that
                    they had, they were pulled out of other things and brought in. They tended to
                    be, by reason of age and education, in more senior jobs than the GIs and
                    enlisted personnel. However, most of the officers were there either running the
                    post, in other words, taking care of the streets and the buildings and so on, or
                    in intelligence and security. They were responsible for security and that sort
                    of thing. There were security officers who gave us security lectures. Obviously,
                    at this date, I can't begin to reproduce them but one of the things that has
                    come to my mind over the years is that the emphasis was on the enemy, Germany.
                    Japan was probably mentioned, but certainly Germany must have been. I really
                    don't think that there was any reference to the Russians, or to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Do you recall anyone asking you if you were in
                        thCommunist Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Oh, absolutely. Even in those days we had to fill out security forms or
                    questionnaires. They were probably what we now call PSQs, that is personnel
                    security questionnaires, but that's a term that came along later. I filled them
                    out. I said to you earlier that with a couple of exceptions, this whole group of
                    30 chemical engineering students from Ohio State went to the project. The
                    exceptions, that we rapidly surmised later, were people - not because of
                    anything they had done, but probably because of foreign birth or foreign parents
                    - who weren't cleared. I can remember one or two - I can almost picture them -
                    that had foreign parents and weren't cleared and didn't get into the project.
                    There was no reference in these security lectures, as I now reconstruct them, to
                    the Russians. We were just worried about the Germans. There were foreigners
                    there, British...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nils Bohr was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Of course, he was, and Fermi and so on. There were people there under
                    the auspices of other governments; namely, the British and a few Canadians. In
                    fact, there were two deaths from experimental work at Los Alamos, and one of
                    them was a Canadian, which is not widely known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family being Jewish, was it of Russian stock or did

                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, of course, most Jewish names have German-sounding roots. No, that
                    was the furthest thing from my mind. As a matter of fact, I didn't think I had
                    any connections with Russian stock, and I don't think I do. My
                    great-grandfather, rather atypically, came to this country during the Civil War
                    as a young kid - I guess you would say a mercenary - to take the place of
                    somebody who was drafted. They were called substitutes. I have his discharge
                    paper - I've been doing a little genealogy - and service records, including the
                    name of the person he substituted for. On my mother's side of the family, they
                    were German.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any particular connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No. We had very little exchange of information on this in our family,
                    and I'm not even sure my parents knew much about their origins. They were both
                    born in New York, and my father's parents came from what he thought was Austria.
                    I now know that it wasn't Austria as we know it today but the Austrian-Hungarian
                    Empire, specifically from the area of Poland called Galicia, right north of
                    Czechoslovakia.</p>

                    town where my grandfather, whom I barely knew, came from. He died when I was
                    five or six after we moved from New York. It's in Poland in Galicia. Again, my
                    father thought his father came from Austria.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to time in the barracks, was there any - following the war - were you
                    only looking and saying, “Boy, if we only get it ready, we'll be able to do
                    this, that and...?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume Berlin was one of the main places to use it at
                        one poinin your thoughts, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I don't know. I don't think my thoughts became that specific and
                    the bomb was not available until well after D-Day. We knew where the project
                    stood in terms of its success. And when was D-Day, around May 25? I don't think
                    any of us consciously said, “Well, let's see where the target's going to be.”
                    I'm sure somebody was saying this, but not among the group that I talked with. I
                    don't think we thought in terms that were that specific. We were just intent on
                    getting it done as soon as we could. It became pretty obvious, before we had a
                    bomb to talk about, that the war in Europe would be over. At some point it was
                    obvious that the only place left was Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you close enough to people who were fighting in the
                        Pacifito see that Japan was going to be an extremely tough nut to
                        crack?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Absolutely. Not from contact with GIs who had been there,but from the
                    news reports of the fighting.</p>
                <p>Q: Particularly Okinawa, this was going to be fighting every little cave and
                    every little town. Did you feel you had the hammer that was going to crack
                    open...?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>KRATZER: We absolutely did. That was the basis for my statement. At the time I
                    made it to my buddy, it was not target-specific, but I said the war would be
                    over in a week. We were just convinced that it was the right thing to do. I know
                    now that, at higher levels, there was a debate going on about whether to use it,
                    how to use it, and whether to do it as a demonstration. I will tell you this -
                    it's one of the things that's stuck in my mind - the test was on July 16, 1945.
                    From that time until the actual drop in Japan on Hiroshima, it was not quite a
                    month. Incidentally, the Hiroshima bomb was not the type that was tested. It was
                    an untested design because it was a design they felt sure would work even
                    without testing. From the time of the test at Trinity until the bomb was dropped
                    in Japan in early August, it was not quite a month. That was a time of almost
                    continuous celebration. The reports about people worrying and having qualms was
                    non-existent. It didn't exist. I'm not saying there weren't serious concerns
                    later; there were. But from that time until the drop, it was continuous
                    celebration.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your reaction and those around you prior to the test? I assume you
                    were all aware of the test and were you able to go out and look at it and all
                    that?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: I didn't. My boss went, and I knew of it the next day. The exact date
                    was not disclosed to us until it was done, but the success of the test was
                    widely known in the technical staff. I think by that time there was almost total
                    confidence that it would work. There was another design, the Hiroshima type, for
                    which the confidence was even higher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern that this might start something that
                        mighnot stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No. There were undoubtedly people who had begun to thinof these things
                    but they were not...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about the idea of starting a reaction that
                        destroythe world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Oh, that! The scientific side. That was talked about. I remember that
                    was talked about a bit and discounted. Calculations were made that led to the
                    conclusion that it was incapable of igniting the atmosphere, and it didn't.
                    Otherwise, we wouldn't be talking here.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you chatting about the bomb when you were sitting around the
                    barracks?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, you put your finger on something interesting. I don't remember
                    sitting around the barracks ever. It wasn't the center of activity. It was just
                    the place where we slept. Our friends who were civilians had slightly better
                    quarters and we tended to spend time there, but that wasn't the main thing. I
                    don't remember shooting the bull with people in the barracks. The discussions
                    were elsewhere. We weren't preoccupied with the consequences. We just knew we
                    were doing the right thing. But it is interesting that we rarely if ever
                    discussed the purpose of the project - the bomb - outside of the laboratory. In
                    that sense, the security rules and lectures were followed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened on July 16? How did you hear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, the test was in the early morning hours. In fact it was still dark
                    so that there was a flash of light. I think it was visible from some portions of
                    Los Alamos but I didn't know it. I sort of regret that I didn't know it but I
                    don't think I would have done anything differently. That day as people came back
                    up from the test site of Trinity, White Sands, we just heard about how well it
                    worked. If not that day, certainly within 24 hours, there were fairly reliable
                    calculations about its force - 20,000 kilotons. From that point on, we knew we
                    had a winner. Now what I didn't know was that the first drop would not be that
                    design but a different one. The Hiroshima bomb was a completely different
                    design. We used U-235 and, because of the nature of it, there was confidence
                    that it would work. It was never tested at Trinity, as a plutonium bomb was. The
                    two together ended the war as far as I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the aftermath of this? I remember seeing movies after the Bikini
                    tests and about sailors going into the test area rather blithely. Obviously, we
                    knew there was a problem but, looking back on it, were we as concerned as we
                    should have been?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, first of all, there was certainly no secret about the hazards of
                    radioactivity. I remember attending lectures about safety. The basic facts about
                    the dangers of radioactivity were known in the early part of the century. I
                    don't knew if you have ever heard of the radium dial cases when they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a fairly well-known play called Hazel
                        Flags.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Is that right? I wasn't aware of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Supposedly she had it when she didn't. It was a comedy,
                        but iwas along that line.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>KRATZER: The hazards were all explained to us. Plutonium is not like radium
                    chemically, but the biological and radiation effects are not unlike that of
                    radium, bone-seeker and so on. This was all explained to us. I worked with
                    plutonium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your potential job of cleaning up if it didn't work would
                        havput you right in the middle of this problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: That's right. What I should have explained and didn't is that, well
                    before Trinity when the plutonium bomb was tested, the decision was made to go
                    ahead because of confidence that it would work. We had pretty much completed our
                    preparations for recovery well before the test. We would have had to, or the
                    recovery system wouldn't have been ready.</p>
                <p>I had begun a different job. The decision was made to build what amounted to a
                    small production plant for bombs at Los Alamos. In other words, moving it out of
                    a strictly laboratory setting, where the first one or two of them were built,
                    into a small production plant. It was called DP-site, but that's not important.
                    This little plant had a series of bays in it. One of the bays was the plutonium
                    recovery plant where, after the bomb was fabricated and a certain amount of
                    scrap was generated, it had to be recovered. I was given the job, without a
                    degree or anything, of designing and running it - with a lot of supervision -
                    but designing and running that little plant. I had a staff of about four or
                    five, and most of them were civilians. I think I may have been the only one
                    there without a degree. That plant was nearing completion at the time of the
                    Trinity test. No, I'm sorry. It was not at the time of the Trinity test, but a
                    month later at the time of the actual drop. An announcement came over the PA
                    system, which was always squawking, that there had been a bomb dropped on
                    Hiroshima.</p>
                <p>There were people up there in rather large numbers, mechanics and so on,
                    particularly where I was working because we were still finishing up the
                    installation of this little plant. Those people didn't know why they were there.
                    Because it was a little chemical plant, most of them were pipe fitters. That's
                    who are used to build chemical plants. I was at that time a very thin guy. I was
                    about 135 pounds and 6'2,” so I was thin, and they called me Slim. These were
                    pipe fitters, and a lot of them were from Oklahoma. We used to talk about
                    Oklahoma. One of them turned to me and said, “Slim, are there any of them there
                    atoms in those tanks?” That's always stuck in my mind. That was my job at the
                    time of Trinity. It was a continuing job. In other words, it had nothing to do
                    with whether the test worked or not.</p>
                <p>I got out of the Army in March 1946, so I was working there at the time of
                    Trinity in 1945 and continued to work there as a GI until March of 1946 when I
                    was discharged. I then came back as a civilian until the fall term began at Ohio
                    State, where I had decided to go back to school.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been sort of anti-climatic to go back to

                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I guess I didn't feel that way at that time. I guess I felt that
                    it was so successful that it had sort of done it's job. Because I wasn't close
                    to the bomb design side of it, I didn't visualize, first of all, the enormous
                    potential for improvement. Although I do remember that there were talks even
                    while I was there, largely on the part of Teller. He was always interested in
                    the “super,” the big bomb; however, that didn't stick in my mind. I kind of
                    thought that it was over as far as the fun was concerned, which was very naive,
                    but that's a function of my not being close to the bomb side of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left, were there severe injunctions or
                        restrictions owhat you could say or not say, sort of euphoria with the war

                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I think we understood. I can't say today that I remember an exit
                    interview or anything of that nature, although it would have been logical for
                    there to have been one. We understood that what we had been doing was secret and
                    would remain secret. I think we understood why, but I don't remember any exit
                    interview or even any paper signing, although maybe I'm wrong about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you worked for a while as a civilian and then you
                        went bacto Ohio State in the fall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I did, back in the fall of 1946, and the winter term ended in December
                    1947 before the Christmas holidays. Ohio State was on the quarter system. I
                    graduated in December of '47 with a degree in chemical engineering. The degree
                    was bachelor of chemical engineering in those days. I suspect that they now call
                    it a B.S. in chemical engineering. By that time, I guess it was one of the major
                    decisions in one's life, I decided to go to work rather than going on to school,
                    which was kind of strange, given my interest in school.</p>
                <p>Q: For that era, you kind of went to work. Master's degrees and Ph.D.s and
                    hanging around the university a long time was not done. That was for
                    professors.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KRATZER: I suppose so. I now know from the people I've worked with over the years
                    that there were a lot of other people who had a better idea than I did of what
                    the pros and cons of going on to graduate school were. The professor that I
                    worked under at Ohio State as an undergraduate was really a remarkable
                    character. He was certainly not a great scientist and probably not even a great
                    engineer, but he was a great teacher and head of the chemical engineering
                    department. He said, “You really ought to go on. Maybe you should go to M.I.T.,”
                    but I didn't. He didn't twist my arm. In hindsight, it is a little strange that
                    I didn't because I continued to be pretty much at the top of the class in
                    chemical engineering. Part of my problem was that I thought I could just read a
                    book and pick up what I needed to know. I had met the girl that I subsequently
                    married, so I decided to go back to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1947?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I graduated in December 1947, and I've never been sure whether. I was in
                    the class of 1947 or the class of 1948 because it was in December, but I think I
                    am listed in the class of 1947. In those days, they had mid-term graduations. I
                    got out of school at a time when engineers had any number of job offers. I
                    pursued a couple that sounded interesting. One was in Cincinnati for Proctor
                    &amp; Gamble and the other was in Tulsa. I decided on going to Tulsa because of
                    my background and the girlfriend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went back to Tulsa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I went back to Tulsa for three years, working in the research department
                    of Standard Oil of Indiana, not their central research department, but the one
                    in that part of the country, on synthetic liquid fuels, which was kind of funny
                    because we still hadn't run out of oil. The thinking then was that we might be
                    close to oil shortages. It was a process that looked interesting, for production
                    of liquid fuels from natural gas, which I worked on. Then, after three years,
                    that folded. That particular job was gone, although my employment at the
                    laboratory was not affected. It turned out not to be a viable project, although
                    millions were spent on it. The Korean War had started and the Atomic Energy
                    Commission was planning to build a new bomb plant in South Carolina, but I'm not
                    sure how much that had to do with my decision to change jobs.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I missed the nuclear business, and I didn't find what I was doing that exciting
                    and as much fun, so in that respect your comment about anti-climatic turned out
                    to be the case. I didn't realize that at first. I contacted the fellow who I had
                    worked for last at Los Alamos. He was not the fellow that I had started working
                    for, because I had switched to a slightly different job. He was a chemist from
                    Vanderbilt and, somewhat to my surprise, the answer didn't come from Los Alamos,
                    but from Washington. It said in effect that he was in charge of a big new
                    project in South Carolina and would be glad to bring me on board, so he did. I
                    first went to Wilmington, Delaware, in a little satellite office. My former boss
                    had gone to work for the Atomic Energy Commission. I knew to some extent the
                    relationship, but I certainly didn't know the subtleties and the distinctions
                    between the AEC, as a body, and the contractors that worked for it and actually
                    did the job. I probably thought, although I'm not sure now what I thought, that
                    I would be working on plant design, but that's not the way it worked. The AEC
                    was a policy making body and, while the jobs were technical, they weren't
                    technical in the same sense as somebody sitting over a lab bench in the actual
                    scientific and technical work. I was sent to the AEC office in Wilmington,
                    Delaware, which was a satellite office of the one in South Carolina. Dupont was
                    the contractor for the project, and the job of AEC was, in effect, to review the
                    work at Dupont, which Dupont thought, I'm sure, totally unnecessary and
                    superfluous. The consequences of this was that I got involved in science
                    administration or technical administration rather than outright technical
                    research and development at the lab level.</p>
                <p>I should have said earlier that, while I was in Tulsa working for the oil
                    company, I went to night law school. I'm still not sure what triggered it. I
                    say, but it's mostly in jest, that it was because we had a septic tank that
                    wasn't working, and I decided that I was going to have to sue the builder. The
                    first part was true, I did have a septic tank that didn't work, but I don't
                    think that's why I went to law school. I just liked school, so I went to night
                    law school for a couple of years but I didn't quite finish the second year
                    before I transferred out to the AEC and went to Wilmington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go out to Wilmington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: That would have been in the spring of 1951. In those three years that I
                    worked for the oil company, I married after about a year. I don't know what
                    triggered my decision to go to law school but I really liked it. I think that's
                    had something to do with my career even though I never finished it.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was in Wilmington for a year, then that office was essentially transferred to
                    the main office in South Carolina, which was directly responsible for AEC
                    oversight of the Savannah River plant and was there for about a year. Of course,
                    that office is still there. After about a year there, I was told that there was
                    a job opening in Washington in the research and development branch of the
                    production division. All of this was in a major unit of the AEC called the
                    production division. It was pretty much the mainstream of the AEC in those days.
                    It was the unit responsible for all these plants that everybody complains about
                    now, creating messes and what have you. It had a research and development branch
                    whose responsibility was, again, to oversee the work of contractors who were
                    working on improvements to all the processes of producing nuclear materials for
                    the weapons program. That sounded like great fun to me. By that time I guess I
                    was becoming a little more aware of the world around me, and I think I realized
                    that if you wanted to get somewhere in an organization like the AEC, you went to
                    Washington. I went to Washington in grade - I'm sure you know what that means -
                    that is, without a salary change, knowing that it would cost me more to live.
                    But I thought that was the right thing to do, and I did. That was in 1953. I
                    moved to Northern Virginia, where I can't find my way from Point A to Point B
                    any longer.</p>
                <p>Q: About this time, having been at Los Alamos and all and the
                    Rosenberg-Greenglass case hit the headlines, did that affect you at all? Did the
                    people start looking at you? Did you become part of just a normal background
                    inquiry or anything like that?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: No. We all were cleared. When I went back to work for the AEC in 1951,
                    my clearance of the war days had lapsed. By that time, I'm sure everything was
                    much more systematized. There was an Atomic Energy Commission. I was aware that
                    I had to fill out a new personnel security questionnaire, but I don't know how
                    long getting my clearance reinstated might have taken. I don't recall having to
                    wait very long. I believe I got my clearance within the normal several months,
                    and I've had a clearance ever since and still do. Every several years, it's
                    renewed. I think I know what you're saying, were people of Jewish extraction
                    looked at differently?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I'm really thinking about people who were there as
                        beinasked, “Did you notice this or that or anything like that?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I was never asked if I knew Greenglass or if I saw anythinsuspicious
                    going on in the lab or anything of that sort.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm trying to capture the spirit of the times. Your having been involved in
                    this process, really from the beginning, what was your initial feeling when you
                    heard that the Rosenbergs had passed on information to the Soviet Union? Now
                    they are portrayed as sort of martyrs for some sort of cause on some side. I
                    never quite felt that way but I was wondering what your reaction was to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Of course, I was horrified. Whenever something like this happens, if you
                    are Jewish and it involves Jewish people, you feel mortified.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you think there was a Jewish feeling about this?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes, in the sense that it makes you feel very sad and badly that it was.
                    I know now, and I guess I probably knew by then, that there was a tendency in
                    the Jewish population, particularly in a place like New York, during the
                    Depression years to embrace liberal and Communist causes. This was a beginning
                    point for things like that. It doesn't excuse it.</p>
                <p>Q: It was a very strong movement. You still see reflections of this in leftist
                    arguments that I pick up on the Internet even today. That's sort of letting go
                    of Marxism.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: I'm sure that's true. First of all, I would have been horrified under
                    any circumstances. In knowing a little bit more about it now than was apparent
                    then, I suspect that the major damage was done, not by the Rosenbergs, but by
                    Fuchs, whom I also knew by sight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, Klaus Fuchs, the German who went back to East
                        Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes. He was part of the British mission. He was not there as an
                    American. He was seconded by the British on the basis of what they believed to
                    be adequate security checks but, of course, weren't. Of course, even if they
                    (Rosenbergs) didn't do the major damage, it doesn't excuse what they did. I
                    don't know that I had any particular feelings about their execution. I'm
                    generally not a fan of the death penalty but I didn't think that that was
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to capture the time. I think this was generally
                        thfeeling. Later one is concerned about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No, I didn't feel that that was improper. Of course, there are people
                    now doing things that I guess are injurious to the national security in terms of
                    espionage and who don't get executed. None of that was apparent then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since we're going to be concentrating on the foreign
                        affairs part of the interview, I still want to obviously pick up some of
                        these historical factors. You were really with the Atomic Energy Commission
                        more or less from then on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>KRATZER: From 1951 until 1971, I was employed by the Atomic Energy Commission.
                    From 1953 onward I was in this little - little is an understatement - it
                    consisted of the branch chief and myself - research and development branch of
                    the production division. As the civilian program got going in 1954, a short time
                    after I got up there, there was a need for people to begin to gear up in the
                    Atomic Energy Commission for the civilian program in various ways. In the
                    production division, the thing that had to be done was to prepare to make
                    available materials that previously were exclusively used for the nuclear
                    weapons program, for civilian research and development and, ultimately, the
                    civilian nuclear power program. My then boss, the one who brought me in and who
                    was probably at that time an assistant director of the production division, was
                    given the responsibility for doing this, for getting things ready for the
                    civilian program. He pulled me into that.</p>
                <p>By this time, without really being conscious of it but, I think to some extent,
                    almost inevitably, I had begun to interest myself in administration. It was not
                    administration in terms of what to do with people, that's not my forte
                    [strongpoint]. I guess maybe a better word is policy, policy related to nuclear
                    energy. While I was at Savannah River my then immediate boss, not the one who
                    brought me in, but the one in charge of the Savannah River program at the
                    technical level - a very interesting guy, John Gray who died a year ago - got
                    pretty much involved in the issue of what is the role of the contractor, what is
                    the role of the Atomic Energy Commission in relation to that of the contractor,
                    and who does what and so on. This got me interested in policy issues. I did most
                    of the work for him on things of that nature. First of all, trying to educate
                    ourselves and through that, the Commission, because there was constant tension
                    between those who thought the contractor didn't need any oversight and the
                    Atomic Energy Commission, who thought they needed a lot of oversight. The
                    question was where to draw the line. We did a lot of policy level work on this.
                    This got me more and more interested in issues like that.</p>
                <p>When the civilian thing came along in Washington, there was need to come up with
                    the terms and conditions on which the nuclear materials that the production
                    division made would be made available to civilian users. My boss at Washington,
                    Frank Pittman, was given that responsibility and brought me into it. Then
                    shortly after, he became the deputy director of a brand new division called the
                    division of civilian application, which was responsible for everything related
                    to civil uses of atomic energy. Let me explain what I mean by that. It had both
                    the responsibility for encouraging civilian uses and the responsibility for
                    regulating them which, of course, is now considered to be a no-no. You don't mix
                    these two things. The director of it was a lawyer named Harold Price, who became
                    the regulatory guru, and my boss, Frank Pittman, the deputy director. He
                    interacted on both sides, but he took responsibility primarily for the
                    promotional side. He brought me into that division as his assistant and, within
                    a short time, we saw the need to create an organizational unit to make these
                    nuclear materials and services available. I became the first head of the branch
                    called the materials and services branch, which was responsible for getting out
                    the materials. We're talking about the mid-1950s now. That was probably
                    1955.</p>

                        atomienergy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: That was December of 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that period of time, what type of things were we
                        looking afor using nuclear materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: From the very beginning, power was the main thrust. That's an
                    understatement. Everybody understood that it had other, we thought, very
                    beneficial uses: medicine, research, and agriculture, for example. We knew that
                    the big-ticket item was nuclear power but we were concerned with both. We wanted
                    to promote both. It was very promotional. From the time of the Eisenhower speech
                    onward, it was considered to be a very good thing for the country. I never
                    thought it was wrong, but there are people that thought that it was over
                    promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember one of the proposals was to use it essentially
                        as aearth mover, such as for digging canals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes. That came a little bit later. That was the so-called Plowshare
                    program, in which you use nuclear weapons to dig big holes or canals. In fact,
                    they tried to use it to stimulate gas production. As an old Oklahoman, I knew
                    that one of the things you can do to stimulate production when you drill a well
                    into a productive formation but the stuff doesn't come out, is to set off a
                    little explosion of nitroglycerine to shatter the rock so that oil can get out
                    more easily. They thought, if you really want to get it out, do it with a
                    nuclear explosion. It was actually tried twice in Colorado. Of course, there are
                    consequences to it. You get more gas but it's got some radiation in it, so that
                    application didn't last very long. In general, the use of nuclear explosives for
                    civilian purposes turned out to be highly controversial and a non-starter. For a
                    lot of reasons - including, non-proliferation and concern about fall-out - it
                    never really materialized, although a number of experiments were performed and
                    considerable money was spent. Many people today don't realize how close we came
                    to this being a viable use.</p>
                <p>Power was always the main thrust. We thought in fact, Louis Strauss is alleged to
                    have said - I suppose it is correct that he said it - that nuclear power would
                    be so cheap that we wouldn't have to meter it any longer. It was like a
                    pendulum: there were periods of intense optimism that we were going to plaster
                    the world with nuclear power but, then, there were other periods of great
                    pessimism when things went slowly and we thought we weren't getting
                    anywhere.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Civil Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes, I was a GS-13. I became a GS-15 fairly quickly, certainly when I
                    had this branch chief job. I continued to do work in that capacity that went
                    beyond the branch chief level, as assistant to the deputy director and, to some
                    extent, to the director as well, on the policy aspects, which I loved. I began
                    at that stage to go to Commission meetings, and I got involved with things -
                    looking back on it - I probably shouldn't have been involved in at my age, in
                    terms of policy. Things like what are you going to charge for nuclear fuel; not
                    what is the right number. But what is the philosophy? Do you make it cheap so
                    that everybody can get it, or do you make it expensive so that nobody can get
                    it? Do you introduce a difference between foreign price and domestic price and
                    things of this nature? I went to Commission meetings. I thought that Strauss was
                    maligned by his detractors. He was given a very bum rap. He was an arrogant,
                    egotistical guy, and that hurt him. In terms of his policies and the like,
                    however, I think he was given a bum rap. I don't know if you remember the
                    details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I really don't. I just remember that he was
                        controversial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: He finished out his term. What happened was that a real grudge battle
                    developed between him and the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. When the Atomic
                    Energy Commission was created, they did something that was historically unusual.
                    They created a joint committee of Congress, the Senate and the House, with very
                    strong oversight powers over what the Commission did. This caused a tremendous
                    amount of tension, particularly under Strauss. The Joint Committee on Atomic
                    Energy had enormous influence and tried to micromanage the AEC, as the
                    Commission saw it. As an AECer I shared that view. Strauss was the whipping boy
                    because he was the one who said, “This is my job and not your job,” and there
                    were two or three members of the joint committee, Senator Anderson, in
                    particular, who were out to get him. He completed his term but was then
                    appointed by Eisenhower as Secretary of Commerce, which I don't really think was
                    a step up except that it was a cabinet level job, a kind of a consolation prize.
                    My recollection is that there was a dramatic Senate vote which he lost by a vote
                    or two, and he wasn't confirmed. I'm pretty sure he was not confirmed. Senator
                    Anderson just pulled in all of his IOUs to defeat him. The funny part about it
                    is that they didn't disagree greatly on substance. They both wanted to promote
                    nuclear energy, they both had very strong feelings about national security, and
                    the differences were really personality, arrogance, and egotism as well as a
                    question of who's in charge here. I thought he was maligned.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The Oppenheimer case was another thing that happened in those days with which I
                    had no direct connection whatsoever other than to see the people. I used see him
                    quite frequently walking the halls. I'm sure you have some familiarity with it.
                    This was kind of further proof that Strauss and the Joint Committee weren't this
                    far apart on substance. Strauss and others decided that Oppenheimer was a
                    security risk, so they pulled his clearance. They gave him the opportunity to
                    resign, according to all accounts, and he refused. He demanded a hearing and, at
                    the completion of those hearings, the board that heard it decided, with the
                    approval of the Commission, to pull his clearance. Again, I had no direct
                    connection, but by that time I had gone far enough up the ladder to interact
                    with several of the people who had direct responsibility for it. I knew the
                    lawyers who were working on it and one of the commissioners, whom I knew well.
                    I'm really not sure how I felt about that. The scientific community, in general,
                    was very much opposed - with one exception - to pulling Oppenheimer's clearance,
                    although they didn't like him. They felt it was unjust. I remember reading the
                    transcript, which was published as a government publication. It was fascinating
                    reading, but it wasn't something that I felt strongly about. I guess I was
                    opposed to it being done, but my concern didn't go beyond that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Strauss left, who took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I think that the next chairman was - his name is on the tip of my
                    tongue... I don't recall that he lasted very long. Gordon Dean, but perhaps he
                    preceded Strauss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't worry. You can fill these things in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: The next chairman that I knew was John McCone. He was appointed by
                    Eisenhower toward the end of the Eisenhower term. I knew him - again, we weren't
                    friends - and I was senior enough by then to have quite a bit of contact with
                    him. A change came about that I didn't mention. I went to the Division of
                    Civilian Application and, if I got there in 1955, the change probably occurred
                    in 1957. A decision was made that there had to be a separation between
                    regulation and promotion. I was given the choice of whether I wanted to go to
                    the regulatory side or the promotional side. I didn't want to go to the
                    regulatory side. I could have stayed with the promotional side, but it became
                    kind of a shell. Just about that time the person who had been my boss in the
                    research and development branch moved to the newly formed division of
                    international affairs. They were looking for people, and we had a good
                    relationship so he brought me in as a branch chief doing basically the same
                    work, materials and services, only this time focused on making materials and
                    services available to other countries, as part of the in international
                    cooperation program.</p>
                <p>Q: On the promotion side, were there concerns initially or restrictions on making
                    atomic energy techniques and equipment available abroad and then how did this
                    play out?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes. There was a major change. It was against the law from the time the
                    Atomic Energy Commission was formed in 1946 until the Eisenhower speech in 1953.
                    That speech didn't change the law but it triggered the change in the law. The
                    law was completely re-written in 1954 to allow and encourage international
                    cooperation as well as a domestic civilian program, but with both under tight
                    security controls. Nuclear technology wasn't to be an open book. The idea was
                    that when information was made available, it would still be, in many cases
                    classified, although there was a new, very large effort started to de-classify
                    as much as possible. On the material side it was under tight control. In fact,
                    the U.S. government continued to own nuclear fuel as they did from the
                    beginning. The change tp private ownership didn't come about for 10 more years.
                    The ownership is sort of a red herring because that's just a piece of paper.
                    Nuclear materials were and are under tight government control. If you have
                    nuclear material, you have to report where it is and account for it to the
                    government, and the government comes in and inspects it if it's domestic. If
                    it's sent overseas that becomes much more complicated. That's really what most
                    of my career has been about.</p>
                <p>I moved over to the division of international affairs and became head of the
                    materials and services branch, as I recall it. Then fairly quickly I became an
                    assistant director for technical matters within the division of international
                    affairs, and then I became deputy director, then director and, finally,
                    assistant general manager, but not overnight.</p>
                <p>Q: In the first place, when you are talking about international affairs, was
                    Great Britain always an exception because they had been in from the
                    beginning?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: They were a partial exception. There's a story, which I'm almost sure is
                    true, although I don't have chapter and verse to prove it. After the separation,
                    which occurred at the end of World War II and the creation of the Atomic Energy
                    Commission by law in 1946, there were reports written by British scientists
                    working in the United States during the war, primarily at Los Alamos, that they
                    could no longer have access to. The restrictions imposed by the Atomic Energy
                    law of 1946 were very, very tight. They weren't just on weapons themselves where
                    the door really was completely closed but even on things that everyone
                    understood, even in those early days, were pretty much benign: civilian uses,
                    radioisotopes, and so on. Everything was classified. In fact, the expression was
                    that atomic energy information is “born classified.” It stayed that way until
                    somebody de-classified it as a result of a tedious process.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We were talking about Britain and Canada being exceptions, and this preceded the
                    change in the law of 1954. There was a little exception carved out on grounds
                    that were highly stylized. It was kind of silly in a way. I remember these
                    papers that were written by a fellow working for me in the Division of
                    International Affairs. It was just a formula. You just changed a few blanks. It
                    was called the Technical Cooperation something or other. It grew out of the fact
                    that we worked together during the war, particularly in the area of procurement
                    of uranium. We jointly bought up essentially all the uranium that we could lay
                    our hands on in the early days of the nuclear program. It was not only to make
                    sure that we had enough for our own purposes, but to make sure nobody else would
                    have it. The arrangement grew out of that, and there was limited cooperation
                    with the British and the Canadians on minor technical things.</p>
                <p>There was also a sort of special cooperation program with Canada that actually
                    preceded or was different from any of these and really did get into areas that
                    were considered of national security significance. When Savannah River was
                    built, the decision was made, for good reasons, to use heavy water reactors
                    there. The Canadians had worked on heavy water reactors from the beginning, even
                    during the war. It was their assigned responsibility to cover that particular
                    approach to the production of plutonium. They were ahead of us in many ways in
                    the use of heavy water. Even at Savannah River, it was a one-way cooperation.
                    They were giving us help, and we weren't giving them any to speak of. They were
                    giving us help on heavy water reactors, so there was cooperation in that
                    respect. But the door was pretty much closed even to the British and Canadians
                    on anything seriously concerned with nuclear power. Radioisotopes for medicine
                    began to be seen fairly early as completely benign and not a problem, but
                    nuclear power has a lot of interfaces with the production of materials for
                    nuclear weapons. That was a door that had to be opened if you were going to have
                    a meaningful cooperation with other countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The first thing of consequence that happened after the 1954 Act was passed in the
                    international field was the Geneva Conferences. These were special. The one of
                    1955, in particular, was very special. It was a direct outgrowth of the
                    Eisenhower speech and his proposal to create a new international organization on
                    atomic energy. There was not yet an international atomic energy agency, so the
                    conference was held under United Nations auspices. A really massive conference -
                    I didn't go to it because I had not yet switched over to the international side
                    - was held in Geneva in 1955. I believe it was called the International
                    Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and everyone was there, even the
                    Russians or Soviets as they were called then. The Third World countries who had
                    any basis for being there, India in particular, were there. The scientist who
                    was elected to be head of the conference was an Indian, Hobi Baba. It was highly
                    promotional. Every country that had something to offer attended. We were
                    obviously in the lead, but the British and the French, in particular, were very
                    aggressive. The research reactors were the big thing, and we actually sent to
                    Geneva a little operating research reactor and set it up and operated it as an
                    exhibit. This happened before I joined the International Division, but I was
                    very much aware of it since; by that time, I had begun to get into the peaceful
                    uses area. In preparation for the conference, there was a massive program of
                    de-classification so that you could talk about things that previously could not
                    have been talked about. It then became a competitive undertaking about who was
                    going to de-classify the most and the fastest. The French - who in our view were
                    inclined to be excessively aggressive in making their progress known -
                    declassified information that we had doubts about. That was 1955.</p>
                <p>The second conference was held in 1958, a third one in 1964, and the last one in
                    1971. They sort of ran downhill. The key ones were 1955 and 1958. From then on,
                    it was largely an afterthought. The two conferences in 1955 and 1958 were big
                    and promotional, and they were the triggers for de-classifying lots of
                    information. By 1958, essentially all peaceful uses, with one or two exceptions,
                    had become de-classified. The big exception was enrichment, producing enriched
                    uranium from natural uranium, and that's still classified. That's an area I've
                    had a lot of interaction with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the concern there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, the concern has been really a mixture of factors. As time has
                    passed, the reasons for this are obvious. Our concerns have migrated from
                    concerns that the Russians would get our enrichment technology, which we
                    considered superior, to concerns that the Third World countries would get it or,
                    for that matter, any country that later is not a nuclear weapons state,
                    especially a Third World country. That concern extended even to the possibility
                    that the Russians might get it indirectly. We didn't even want countries like
                    Britain, or especially France, to have it because of concern that they might be
                    a source of leakage to the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>There was a secondary reason, and this is what I began to say. It was always
                    there but probably rarely if ever stated. Enrichment had begun to appear to be
                    both good business - we were selling enriched uranium abroad - but also became
                    very important in national security terms because we wanted countries to use
                    enriched uranium, of which we were the sole source of supply, for their reactors
                    as a national security measure. Because we were the sole source of supply, we
                    could impose terms and conditions on its use and assure non-diversion to
                    military uses. We couldn't do this if they chose competing fuel nuclear
                    enrichment, which was natural uranium, which was available from many countries.
                    We acknowledged this openly. That was always open. The fact that nuclear
                    enrichment was also good business was the part that people would be inclined not
                    to say. Those were the reasons why, in those days, we had never de-classified
                    the technology for producing enriched uranium. It is still classified but now
                    the target is different. The French enrich uranium commercially. The British,
                    Dutch, and Germans have a joint enterprise that enriches it commercially. The
                    Japanese are working on it. But we still want to keep enrichment technology out
                    of the hands of the potential proliferators. Maybe the targets will change at
                    some point in time. At the moment the concern is about Third World countries
                    that are potential proliferators.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period up to 1970 or so, were we pretty secure in feeling that
                    nuclear power plants were a pretty safe technology? Was this a concern to
                    you?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: You mean safe in hazard terms or national security terms?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hazard terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KRATZER: I think so. It was always a concern. We used to feel that we were the
                    pioneers of self-regulation; that is, without anyone putting the heat on us, the
                    public, or what have you. The Atomic Energy Commission and the people who worked
                    in nuclear energy, I think, really felt we were doing the right thing in terms
                    of safety and a good job. Nuclear energy is potentially very hazardous. Everyone
                    knew that and sometime, probably in the mid-to-latter 1950s, a very significant
                    report with a lot of impact was written by Brookhaven National Laboratory that
                    estimated the hazard in numerical terms. While the risk of a reactor accident is
                    very, very small, the consequences can be very, very large. We're talking in
                    terms of hundreds of millions of dollars of potential damage that could result
                    from one reactor accident, if it took place in the wrong place and on a very
                    large scale. People always understood that that was true but it was the first
                    time that anybody had put numbers for it. That put enormous incentives on
                    developing nuclear power safely, and nobody disagreed with that approach. The
                    Commission always thought that it was running a strong safety program. Without
                    outside pressures, it created various mechanisms for reviewing the safety of
                    reactors, for example, an advisory committee on reactor safeguards, designed to
                    make sure that no reactor got built that could present undue safety hazards. I
                    was in the Division of Civilian Application for a while that had the safety
                    responsibility, although I am not a safety expert in any sense of the word. I
                    did have some involvement in it. The 1954 Act had elaborate provisions, which
                    are still in effect, for licensing private activities to ensure that safety
                    requirements are followed. Of course, none of these regulations are perfect.</p>
                <p>Q: You were talking about self-regulation. What seems to happen over the years is
                    that, particularly for commercial firms, decisions begin to be made that are
                    designed more for profit and corners begin to be cut.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: There is a feeling, I know, that that happens. Certainly you can find
                    examples of that. I don't think anybody knowingly, at least not at a responsible
                    level, will deliberately cut corners, knowing that it's taking a significant
                    risk but wanting to reap short-term profits from it, I don't think that
                    happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just thinking of the operations. You have an
                        electrigenerating nuclear plant. Over a period of time confidence
                        builds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Absolutely. At the level of individuals, it's not exciting work. I'm not
                    a reactor operator, though I've had a little exposure to reactor operators. It's
                    not a fun job. You sit there with a bunch of dials and buttons. Most of these
                    folks are not highly technically trained. In fact, after Three Mile Island
                    (TMI), which I'm sure you are familiar with, it emerged that the technical
                    reactor advisor was off duty and everyone under him was, in effect, a
                    technician, i.e., non-professional, non-college educated people. I don't mean to
                    denigrate them but they didn't have the technical background in some cases to
                    understand the science of what was happening inside a reactor.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>By the time of Three Mile Island, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had been
                    completely separated from the former Atomic Energy Commission. The first step,
                    which took place in the 1960s, was separation within the Atomic Energy
                    Commission of the regulatory function from the promotional one. That separation
                    was actually a physical one. The Regulatory people were moved to a different
                    building with a different head and the only connection was at the level of the
                    five appointed commissioners themselves. There was a total statutory separation
                    later that created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and did away with the
                    Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>In any event, the point I'm making is that when people sit there doing this kind
                    of relatively uninteresting work, especially without deep technical
                    understanding of what's happening, there is a potential for them to become
                    somewhat careless. One of the remedial steps that this new commission, the
                    Nuclear Regulatory Commission, decided on in the case of licensed power reactors
                    is that there should be a technical person present on every shift. That was
                    resisted for a while by the nuclear power industry, if my memory is correct. It
                    seems to me to be self-evident that that's a good thing to do. Sure, it is
                    possible for people to get careless, and the basic concept was that the reactor
                    design was supposed to be fool-proof, not in the sense of keeping accidents from
                    happening but in the sense of containing the consequences if an accident did
                    happen. In fact, that was largely successful at Three Mile Island, which is one
                    of the constant sources of debate between the industry and the anti-nuclear
                    organizations and, to some extent, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. TMI was,
                    of course, a disaster in many respects but nobody got hurt because the safety
                    system, specifically the containment, essentially worked. The amount of
                    radiation that was released was minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to this, you were dealing with international
                        affairall along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I believe that I started that in 1957. By 1960, I believe I had become
                    deputy director or perhaps the deputy director and maybe the director of the
                    Division of international Affairs. Then a year or two later, they consolidated
                    two jobs, one called the assistant general manager of the AEC for international
                    activities and the other, the director of the division of international affairs.
                    That came about because the people who had occupied those jobs were posted to
                    the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. You know how it works in
                    international organizations. There were certain jobs that were U.S. jobs. The
                    senior U.S. job in that organization was the deputy director general for
                    administration. The first director general was, in fact, anAmerican. That was
                    widely viewed as a mistake. He was Sterling Cole, who had been the chairman of
                    the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and it was a political appointment, since
                    the Agency resulted from Eisenhower's proposal. Cole was a good director
                    general, but the position should never be occupied by a U.S. or a Soviet or a
                    Brit or any nuclear weapon state.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>When Cole completed his term around 1961 or so, the senior job that was sort of
                    reserved for the U.S. became deputy director general for administration. My boss
                    in the division of international affairs at the agency took that job, and I
                    moved up a notch. He had still another boss who was the assistant general
                    manager for international activities. When my original boss came back and went
                    into other work, I became both the director and the assistant general manager.
                    That was essentially a policy assignment, although I feel that it still had a
                    lot of technical components in it. The first director of the division was a
                    lawyer. The second one was a political scientist. I was the first technically
                    trained director. You do the job a little differently. Among the things that I
                    got involved in, because it has a lot of technical content but I also saw it as
                    the principal thrust of the job, was the non-proliferation area and the
                    so-called safeguards, or verification to use a more general term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, how long would you continue in various
                        jobbut in this international field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, if my recollection is correct, I started in 1957 as branch chief.
                    I think that certainly within a year, I became an assistant director for
                    technical programs, I forget the exact title. Probably within a year after that,
                    I became the deputy director. I'm guessing at this to some extent but it is
                    fairly accurate. Then within a year after that I became the director. I guess
                    after 1963 or so, I became the director plus assistant general manager for
                    international activities.</p>
                <p>Q: What I am trying to get, because we are concerned in this type of interview
                    with international affairs, is how long did you continue, in one capacity or
                    another, in international affairs?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: I continued in that until the time I left the Commission in 1971 and
                    transferred to the Department of State, which I think may be a focus of what you
                    want to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to 1971, what were our major concerns in the
                        internationafield country-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I am sure this isn't unique in the government but every government
                    department tends to have its own international affairs functions and
                    organizations. The Atomic Energy Commission wasn't a cabinet department but, in
                    those days, it was an important organization. It began as one of the “sexy”
                    spots to be in the government, a position that to some extent was later taken
                    over by NASA. As a result, it was definitely in the middle of things. It was
                    given by law a statutory and a very significant role in international relations.
                    It had it's own little state department, if you want to put it in those terms.
                    That was the division of international affairs, which included, at times, as
                    many as six or seven overseas positions. It had two general areas of
                    responsibility, which it carried out through its staff in Washington and
                    overseas offices. There was also close cooperation, which I think is the focus
                    point of what you want to talk about, with the State Department. It was a very
                    good cooperative relationship, although I suppose that at times, there was a
                    certain desire to be first, but overall it was a good cooperation.</p>
                <p>I can tell you some of the reasons for that, but one area of AEC responsibility
                    was the promotional one. From the time of Eisenhower onward with the Atoms for
                    Peace Program, we were promoting nuclear energy. There are those who say, not so
                    much at the time, but later, that this was overdone. It was promotional, and we
                    promoted it because we thought it was good for the country, first to be the
                    leader in this field of high technology, and second, to channel the nuclear
                    activity overseas, which was taking place anyway, into peaceful rather than
                    military uses. You couldn't stop it. That was the thrust of the Eisenhower
                    speech: to channel nuclear activity into peaceful programs, and to develop
                    control and verification to keep it from turning each to military uses. That was
                    the rationale of the promotion aspect of international nuclear cooperation. The
                    other part of it was sort of a mirror image of the domestic situation, which was
                    what could be called a regulatory side. In other words, making sure that what we
                    did overseas was done safely in both the hazard sense and the sense of
                    non-proliferation. Making sure our assistance was not being turned to military
                    uses and, beyond that, actually encouraging peaceful uses. The balance that had
                    to be struck was, how much can you safely promote nuclear energy without doing
                    the very thing you don't want to do, i.e., encourage or facilitate military
                    programs? That was, and to some extent still is, a legitimate issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to 1971, were there any countries that gave us concern,
                        likFrance and Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, we have to distinguish sharply between France and Germany. France
                    was a wartime ally as well as a pioneer of nuclear energy in its own right, and
                    it became a nuclear weapon state through its own efforts in the early 1960s. Let
                    me say as a partial answer that there was a sub-program going on after the 1954
                    change to the Atomic Energy Act that opened the door to peaceful nuclear
                    cooperation. It opened the door to peaceful nuclear cooperation only; there was
                    little or no military cooperation. When Sputnik came along in 1957, the
                    philosophy took hold in Congress of why should we deprive our friends and allies
                    of information that our enemies already have? While Sputnik, per se, wasn't a
                    military thing, it convinced people that the Soviets were very advanced in a lot
                    of things. This led to changes in the Atomic Energy Act that opened the door to
                    military cooperation. The changes were complicated, but it was almost
                    exclusively with the British at the level of actual weapons design. We actually
                    had, and I am reasonably sure we still have, an active weapons cooperation. I
                    got involved with the negotiation of the agreements with the British in the
                    areas of nuclear submarine propulsion, nuclear weapons design, and the exchange
                    of nuclear weapons material. They provided us with plutonium, for which we had a
                    need, in exchange for weapons grade U-235, of which we had a surplus.</p>
                <p>Now, the French wanted in the worst way to be the beneficiaries of this same kind
                    of cooperation with us, and we closed the door on that. DeGaulle was in power
                    then, and he saw that as the ultimate insult. The primary reason for it, and I
                    was fairly involved in this, was a concern that the French atomic energy program
                    still included communists or former communists in some senior positions. We had
                    cooperation between our respective security staffs with the British and to a
                    lesser degree with the French. We would examine their clearance process, not
                    their individual decisions, but their process for clearing people, and they
                    supposedly would examine ours although it was mostly the opposite direction. The
                    feeling was, I can't say to what extent it was correct, that the French atomic
                    energy program was not secure in terms of being an appropriate recipient of our
                    classified military nuclear information. So, they were never allowed to have the
                    same kind of cooperation as the British. As a sort of consolation prize, we did
                    supply the material for their prototype land-based nuclear submarine, which
                    allowed them to get maybe a couple of years head start on their own nuclear
                    submarine program. They weren't yet producing enough of this material to do it
                    themselves. That didn't include any information, just the material.</p>
                <p>A lot of countries - the Dutch, the Italians, later the Canadians - all wanted,
                    not so much our weapons because that was totally ruled out, but cooperation in
                    nuclear submarine design, including propulsion. Rickover was tremendously
                    powerful. His word was law in his field and sometimes out of his field. He just
                    said, “No.” I was the guy who normally had to tell our NATO partners, although
                    the policy came from him. The nuclear submarine cooperation was somewhat a side
                    issue. There also was, and is, cooperation with NATO as an organization that
                    allows us to transfer classified nuclear military information on the use of
                    nuclear weapons, what they do and protection against them but not their design.
                    That cooperation is ongoing. That all took place after this change in the Atomic
                    Energy Act in 1958.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The main area of cooperation in civil atomic energy was nuclear power; the other
                    aspect was pretty much radioisotopes for medical and other research. We can lay
                    that aside because all that was and is essentially in the public domain. In the
                    areas of nuclear power, we made a very sharp distinction between the Soviet bloc
                    countries as they existed from 1954 onward, and essentially the rest of the
                    world. There were regulations that name these countries that the Commerce
                    Department promulgated, I'm sure on the advice of the State Department. It
                    included all the Sino-Soviet bloc countries, the Chinese, and so on. We could
                    not have with those countries cooperation that involved the transfer of material
                    or the transfer of hardware, such as reactors. It could not be done. There
                    could, however, be exchanges of information as long as it was unclassified and
                    under fairly tight control by the Atomic Energy Commission. We, in fact, had
                    such exchanges with the Soviet Union from 1958 onward, but particularly probably
                    more intensively from about 1960 onward.</p>
                <p>We exchanged visits, but no materials, no hardware, just unclassified
                    information, including some that was not published. I think it is fair to say,
                    and there are some interesting anecdotes I can give you on this, that it was a
                    status symbol in Washington to have Soviet contacts and cooperation. The
                    Commissioners, in particular, were very much taken by this, and we had exchanges
                    of visits at that level. The exchanges were always tit for tat. They wanted to
                    come here to places A, B, and C; in exchange, we had to be able to go there to
                    comparable places.One that sticks in my mind vividly is that there was a Soviet
                    mission here by invitation at the time of Kennedy's assassination. At first, no
                    one knew what had happened and there was at least a suspicion that it might have
                    been a Soviet-inspired action. The Soviet visitors were not in Washington at the
                    time of the assassination; they were at one of our laboratories. Their schedule
                    was changed to keep them out of town until things quieted down somewhat and
                    there was some understanding as to what had happened. They came back perhaps a
                    week later, by which time Kennedy had been buried. They wanted very much to go
                    to his grave, and we got special permission to allow them to do it. I guess I
                    went with them. I am convinced they were genuinely affected by it.</p>
                <p>I don't know if you're interest in an anecdote, but this is something that really
                    did happen. The head of the commission in 1960 was John McCone. I don't know
                    whether you know much about him but he'd headed a very major industrial activity
                    in San Francisco during World War II, building ships. He was a very successful,
                    very wealthy man. He was supposed to be a highly competent administrator of
                    large technical enterprises but never had a government job before. He took over
                    from Strauss. The head of the delegation to the International Atomic Energy
                    Agencies general conferences was always the head of the Atomic Energy
                    Commission, so John McCone took that job over after Louis Strauss retired and
                    had completed his term.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>McCone was a very prominent Catholic layman. I believe he was a major contributor
                    to the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. He didn't want to have
                    anything to do with the Russians. He was strongly anti-communist. Now, one of
                    the members of the Atomic Energy Commission, as a member state, is the Vatican.
                    The head of their delegation was always a man named Frank Folsom, who I believe
                    was the head of CBS. He, too, was a prominent Catholic layman but, more
                    importantly, the number two guy in the delegation was Father Theodore Hesburgh
                    who was the head of Notre Dame University at the time. Hesburgh convinced McCone
                    that he was being too sticky about this and that that was not the right way to
                    deal with the Russians. Hesburgh got them together in Vienna. From that time
                    onward, McCone developed a close relationship with his counterpart who was the
                    chairman of the Soviet atomic energy program. So, there was always this
                    U.S.-Soviet cooperation. It was fairly intensive at times because the Russians
                    were advanced in certain areas where we could profit from their knowledge.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the very interesting things was that both the Soviets and the United
                    States, at a certain point, were mutually wanting to keep the nuclear club
                    closed for very obvious reasons.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Absolutely. This was vital. We did have a commonality of interest. We
                    were both strong supporters of non-proliferation. At the very beginning when the
                    International Atomic EnergAgency was first created - I think the first
                    conference I went to was in 1958, which was the second one - the Soviet
                    delegation sought to dismiss safeguards. Their pitch was that safeguards were
                    baloney, and “we're the nice guys” and “we're not going to control you.” Within
                    roughly two or three years - and I became a first-hand observer of this change -
                    they got “religion” and decided that they had as much interest in a strong
                    verification or safeguards program on the part of the International Atomic
                    Energy Agency as we did. I remember this especially well because it took place
                    in a series of meetings at IAEA headquarters in Vienna at which I was heading a
                    U.S. delegation for the first time. It was a meeting of the IAEA Safeguards
                    Committee to extend the IAEA safeguards system to larger nuclear reactors. We
                    had received advanced hints from a very competent Yugoslav who was then in
                    charge of Safeguards that the Soviets would probably be more cooperative then in
                    the past, but no one knew how far they would go.</p>
                <p>During the final meeting of the committee, there were a number of opponents of
                    stronger safeguards who were still counting on Soviet support, and I decided to
                    ask for a vote, which was very much out of keeping with the practice then and
                    now of attempting to decide everything by consensus. Our position was adopted -
                    either with Soviet support or possibly abstention - I can no longer remember
                    which. I believe the year was 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>From that time on, there were a lot of ups and downs but I think, in hindsight,
                    that these were side issues compared to our common interest in nonproliferation.
                    For example, we constantly, after the Hungarian uprising in October of 1956,
                    challenged the Hungarian delegation's credentials. It was one of the games
                    that's always played in such international conferences. This is not my area of
                    expertise, but when you're on the delegation you get involved. A few years
                    later, we would be challenging somebody else's credentials. For many years, we
                    successfully voted down the Chinese. You'd lose your job if you didn't support
                    these positions. We had friction with the Soviets on all of these issues.</p>
                <p>On the core issue of non-proliferation and effective safeguards, however, they
                    became our collaborators. We collaborated, also, in the essentially bilateral
                    area of cooperation of advanced reactor technology, in areas where they were
                    doing very interesting work. At the engineering level, they were always wanting.
                    They just don't do things very well. They didn't then; they don't now, but their
                    concepts are interesting in many cases. There was close cooperation at the level
                    of nuclear science and reactor concepts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Communist China? Again, we're tracking this
                        period uto 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, that was totally out of bounds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the tests in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It was in the early 1960s, I think, when they had their first tests. I
                    should explain that the intelligence function in the AEC, in other words keeping
                    track of what other countries were doing, was not part of my responsibility. I
                    got reports but not all that many. There were people who were following China
                    and knew it was going to happen, so it wasn't a big surprise. We didn't really
                    challenge it because there wasn't anything we could do about it.</p>
                <p>The same was true oFrance. We weren't happy about the French explosion, which was
                    a year or two earlier. We knew a lot more about that, and we knew they were
                    working on these things but there was no real basis for us to take them on. An
                    interesting issue, that we could control, was whether we should continue to
                    cooperate with the French on peaceful things after their test. We did. We didn't
                    try to stop that in any way. In the case of China, there wasn't any cooperation,
                    so there was nothing we to stop.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I was thinking of Israel as I was talking about these other cases. That
                    issue never goes away. I have had some involvement with it over the years. There
                    is a very, very strongly held belief on the part of people outside the
                    government and probably some inside the government that we deliberately turned
                    our eyes away from the Israeli development. I don't really think this is true. I
                    think we were concerned about it, unhappy about it. Let me give you some
                    specifics. McCone was the chairman when the Israeli program surfaced and, to the
                    best of my knowledge, he did not have prior knowledge of it, although there are
                    those who dispute that. He was close to the end of his term, and it was already
                    announced that he would retire. You have heard all the stories about Dimona, the
                    Israeli nuclear plant, Originally, the Israelis said it was a garment factory.
                    It quickly became obvious that it was a nuclear reactor, which they acknowledged
                    fairly quickly. McCone was invited to be on “Meet the Press” or some similar
                    program. In those days, there weren't as many, and they were radio, or perhaps
                    television. I can't remember for sure. In any event, he was invited to be on it
                    one Sunday. We didn't know what he was going to say because he was his own boss.
                    I got a call from colleagues at the State Department, saying, “Tell McCone to go
                    easy, to not be too alarmist,” and so on. So, I called McCone. He had a temper,
                    and I don't think he was mad at me, but he said, “Listen, I am not closing out
                    my government career by shutting my mouth,” because at the time he thought he
                    was quitting. As a matter of fact, he was subsequently appointed director of the
                    CIA, but he didn't know that then, or if he did, he wasn't saying so. He went on
                    the program, and he was quite critical of Israel and said Dimona should be
                    placed under international safeguards, which was our position.</p>
                <p>Later on, as is now widely known, although they were supposedly highly
                    confidential or secret at the time, there were inspection visits to Dimona,
                    which were conducted by people from an AEC lab. The specific guy with
                    responsibility for it was the then-head of the AEC division of intelligence, a
                    fellow named Reichardt. I was aware of the visits, and I saw the reports and I
                    talked to some of the people who made the visits. I can't remember whether I
                    talked to them before they went or after they came back. A very close friend of
                    mine from one of the labs headed several of those missions. To make a long story
                    short, I did not see evidence that we were complacently winking our eye. I'm not
                    sure what we could have done. The example I use to test critics outon this is
                    the fact that the Indians did the same thing without reaction by us. No one goes
                    around saying that we didn't care about the Indians moving in this direction. We
                    did care about the Indians and I believe we did care about Israel.</p>

                <p>KRATZER: Maybe we would, in some extreme circumstances, go to war to prevent
                    proliferation by a hostile country. The policy has always been
                    non-proliferation; it's not good for additional countries to get nuclear
                    weapons. But the intensity of our opposition has really not been that consistent
                    over the years; it didn't start that strongly. Initially, the feeling tended to
                    be that we don't want it to be accomplished with our material, but we were less
                    concerned if a country did it on its own. I've said this publicly, sometimes
                    with some annoyance on the part of those listening. We didn't want it to be on
                    our watch. We didn't want to help anybody but, if they managed to get it on
                    their own, well, we tended to accept it. Quite a few things support that point
                    of view. Now, people on the Hill, when I've said that to some of them in the
                    past, weren't very happy with hearing it. But if you look at the legislation,
                    the Atomic Energy Act, the initial point of view was that they - other countries
                    - would not be allowed to do it with our stuff. While we didn't encourage them
                    to do it with other resources, the policy to some extent was more permissive
                    than we like to think it was then and than we think it is now. When the chips
                    are down, the options are pretty limited. Look at Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Q: Sure. The only other way of doing it is to look at what happened when Iraq
                    started developing it and you bomb the facilities. That's not really an option
                    that's open to us too often.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: The whole business of lowering the boom on Iraq, which I strongly
                    support, was not initially about concern of weapons of mass destruction. We
                    didn't go in there because of concern about weapons of mass destruction. We went
                    in there because they invaded their neighbor, and we should have gone. The
                    evidence of nuclear weapons development that we had in bits and pieces at the
                    time got much more detailed later. They were heavily engaged in weapons of mass
                    destruction development. That's almost, you might say, fortunate. It's not
                    fortunate that they were doing it, but the knowledge that they were doing it was
                    a fortunate byproduct of the War. It wasn't the cause of the Gulf War; it was a
                    byproduct.</p>

                        come about?</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>KRATZER: I had been the assistant general manager for international activities at
                    the AEC, and I figured that that was pretty much the end of the line. In terms
                    of personal advancement, in other words, the general manager, even if I had
                    otherwise been qualified, was traditionally chosen from the main line of the
                    Commission, which was the nuclear materials production and weapons program. I
                    was interested in overseas assignments, and the main line of the Commission was
                    domestic activities. I think the trigger was really Herman Pollack, who was then
                    the head of the science bureau in the Department of State and who had become a
                    friend and collaborator, my opposite number in the State Department. He had, on
                    a number of occasions, said that anytime I feel like being one of his overseas
                    people, a science counselor or a science attach�, to let him know. He made that
                    statement one day when I felt it was about time to leave. No doubt a
                    contributing factor was that the tenure of the then chairman, Glen Seaborg, was
                    ending. I didn't know who the next chairman would be but I didn't particularly
                    want to start with a new one. These things came together. Herman, in effect -
                    within reasonable limits - gave me the choice of any post where he had an
                    opening. One of those posts was Argentina. I had some Spanish language
                    capability and my wife had some, and we liked the idea of a Spanish-language
                    post. It was a new beginning and a new career, and I did it.</p>

                <p>KRATZER: I was there from 1971 to 1973. Bureaucratically, it was, in the eyes of
                    my friends and colleagues, a step backward from being an assistant general
                    manager at the AEC, which was a statutory job but there was no pay change. More
                    importantly, I was interested in going overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I'm glad you mentioned that. Buenos Aires was one of the posts where the
                    Atomic Energy Commission had one of its overseas offices. At that stage, the AEC
                    had perhaps six or so offices in embassies. The officers had the title of AEC
                    scientific representative. The offices were funded by the AEC but, like all
                    overseas positions, the officers reported to the ambassador in principle, but in
                    reality we were there to do the AEC's work. In fact, the offices reported
                    programmatically to me as AEC assistant general manager. One the conditions of
                    my going - and it turned out that it was compatible with who was then scheduled
                    to leave the respective posts - was that I would take both the State Department
                    science attach� and AEC jobs. I would become a State Department Foreign Service
                    officer and be a science counselor, but I would consolidate that position with
                    what had previously been a separate job as the AEC scientific
                    representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would make sense. Otherwise, you would be right up
                        againseach other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>KRATZER: It had been separate before, but given my AEC background, it did not
                    make any sense with my going out there. The reality, which I guess I always
                    knew, was that there weren't two jobs to be done. It was an interesting post but
                    not that active, so I performed both jobs without much strain. In fact, from
                    that point onward, I became a State Department employee, although I would say
                    that most of my time in Argentina was spent on nuclear matters. That's not
                    inconsistent with being a science counselor because one of the major issues
                    coming to the fore at that time was non-proliferation. It had always been there
                    but was growing in recognition and importance. Herman, I think quite rightly,
                    felt that people who could do the best job in this area were those with a
                    nuclear background. Herman filled a number of science attach� posts with people
                    from the Atomic Energy Commission who had a nuclear background. That was almost
                    a requirement for the job of science counselor in those days.</p>
                <p>Q: What was our concern in Argentina in 1971 and 1972.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: There was concern that the Argentines had a military nuclear program in
                    the back of their mind. There was no evidence while I was there that they were
                    actively pursuing it, though the whole nature of their program indicated they
                    were keeping this option open. They desired to be independent in each of the
                    steps of the nuclear fuel cycle, and they had a preference for natural uranium
                    reactors to avoid U.S. control of fuel supply.</p>
                <p>Q: We were concerned both about Argentina and Brazil. We essentially didn't have
                    any great quarrel but we didn't like the thought of both of them running around
                    with nuclear weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes. That's right. They weren't adversaries but they were certainly
                    rivals. They were rivals in terms of who was making the most progress in a
                    number of fields, whose economy was the strongest, and who was technically the
                    most advanced. The Argentines, although smaller, laid claim to that,
                    particularly in the area of science and technology. The area of atomic energy
                    was one of the competitive areas. It's funny the way minds work in that part of
                    the world. When the Atomic Energy Commission first set up its overseas program,
                    and I don't mean just international cooperation but actually setting up overseas
                    offices, the decision was made initially to have a representative in Buenos
                    Aires dealing with Latin America as a whole. The Brazilians were so upset by
                    this that we had to set up a parallel office in Rio de Janeiro so that there was
                    one in both places. It didn't turn out to be a matter of great importance, but
                    the Argentine office both for the AEC and the State Department was a regional
                    job. It was understood that Argentina was to be the main focus of activity but,
                    in point of fact, it was a regional job that covered the southern cone. It
                    covered Uruguay, Paraguay (where essentially nothing nuclear goes on), Chile,
                    and Peru, which is an interesting country, but not Brazil. Of course, those were
                    the days of Allende in Chile, but I did get over there. The same controversy
                    between Argentina and Brazil arose at the IAEA in Vienna. The IAEA statute
                    provided that the most advanced country in nuclear energy in Latin America would
                    be a permanent member of the IAEA Board of Governors, and Argentina and Brazil
                    argued over who would fill that position. The final solution was to split it,
                    with the two countries alternating.</p>
                <p>Now one of the things that I think is worth saying is that, which I assume is one
                    of the areas of interest to you, Herman really re-created, in my judgment, the
                    science counselor and science attach� program. He put it on the track that I
                    assume it's still on today although my contact with it is not very extensive
                    right now. At one time there was an earlier science attach� program in the
                    Department. The science counselors in the early days - I knew very few of them
                    personally - tended to be people who had retired from academia, very prominent
                    in their fields. I think there was a State Department science advisor to whom
                    these people nominally reported. They built up relationships with their
                    counterparts in the scientific communities in the countries where they went. I
                    am sure they did this very well. As a completely separate organizational unit at
                    State, there was a position known as SAE, special assistant to the Secretary for
                    Atomic Energy. The first occupant of this position that I knew was Gerard Smith,
                    who later went on to be head of ACDA, the Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Administration; he was a very prominent individual. He happened to be a wealthy
                    man, which is perhaps not relevant, but he was also a man of considerable
                    reputation. He had been a colleague and, I guess, a friend of Louis Strauss at
                    the Atomic Energy Commission and moved over, probably at the request of Dulles,
                    to the position of SAE. His deputy also came from the Atomic Energy Commission,
                    a gentleman named Philip Farley who was absolutely first rate. He replaced Smith
                    when Smith retired. This organizational unit originally had nothing to do with
                    the science counselor program, but the two were ultimately merged.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: I may have the facts a little mistaken but I think that Herman Pollack was the
                    first individual and probably the only one who proposed it, although I don't
                    have any direct knowledge of this.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Herman came out of Administration in State. He was not an FSO. I don't
                    think he was particularly trained in political science and certainly not in any
                    of the physical or natural sciences but he was an excellent administrator and a
                    very thoughtful guy. He put together these programs: the program of science
                    attaches and science counselors and the SAE activity into what became SCI, the
                    Science Bureau. His title was Director. It was a bureau, but not a bureau headed
                    by an assistant secretary at that time. Herman saw that the real job of the
                    science counselor abroad was that of interacting, not so much on science in the
                    narrow sense, but on science policy with the host country. The job included
                    non-proliferation very prominently because of its importance in those days and
                    still in the nuclear field in general. The emphasis, as Herman saw it, should be
                    on the political side of science. Herman also saw that the people who could do
                    this the best were people knowing how science worked at the policy level of the
                    U.S. government. A lot of these people, like myself, came from the Atomic Energy
                    Commission where science and government policy first interacted most
                    intensively. A number of us were people with backgrounds from various government
                    agencies, including the Atomic Energy Commission with government science
                    backgrounds. Herman built the science bureau and particularly the science
                    attach� program around the concept of science policy.</p>
                <p>I went to Argentina knowing that it wasn't the hottest spot in the world in
                    professional terms but still an interesting place, a place that I thought,
                    mistakenly at the time, was ready to emerge from the days of Peron and not very
                    much progress. I also felt that it was time for a change of pace and a little
                    less intense work. Relaxation was not the word because the hours were long but
                    the work was certainly not of the intensity that I had been accustomed to. That
                    was to be a four-year assignment but it ended prematurely after about two years.
                    Herman initially asked me and then told me that there was an opening in Japan
                    that I was to take. I transferred directly from Argentina to Japan, which, of
                    course, was much more active.</p>

                        then? KRATZER: The ambassador was John Lodge.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he very much interested in science?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: He was very interested. He was a very colorful character. I think that's
                    widely known in the State Department. I'm not talking out of school but he had
                    come from a very interesting background. In addition to being a member of the
                    prominent Lodge family, he was a movie actor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw him in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: The Little Colonel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also in Catherine the Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Quite probably. He spoke very commendable Spanish and had a very, very
                    active social life. He had many friends in Argentina. I think he was the right
                    person at the right time in Buenos Aires. He would certainly not have been the
                    right person at many other times in Buenos Aires. He interacted extremely well
                    with the then government of that country. He was interested in everything. He
                    liked science - I don't know that he was knowledgeable - and he particularly
                    liked the natural sciences. He was a conservationist of the old school. He liked
                    the fact that Argentina was the home to a lot of rare species - whales and the
                    like - which he kept track of. He loved to travel around the country and visit
                    some of these places. I don't know that he ever made it to Antarctica but
                    Argentina takes the position that it owns a good slice of Antarctica and that
                    was a matter of interest to him. He was interested in science. He didn't delve
                    into it deeply, but he was on top of many things.</p>
                <p>Q: Are science attaches, in general, there sort of like military attaches, not
                    spying but collecting intelligence? Were you dishing out stuff or were you
                    commercially trying to promote American things?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes. All of the above, but I think that is a central question. I have
                    thought a fair amount about it and reported on some of these things to the
                    Department. Every Foreign Service officer or attach� is there to get information
                    on an open basis. I always wanted to avoid doing anything that the host country
                    would consider to be off base. Everything we wrote was, of course, available to
                    the station and to headquarters in Washington. In other words, it was available
                    to the intelligence community, but it wasn't collected for them on request. No
                    one ever asked me to break that rule but that was my own thinking about what the
                    proper course was. We also kept the host country informed of major science
                    policy developments in the U.S. in areas that were of interest to them, which in
                    Argentina were fairly limited. Again, my feeling was and still is that the main
                    job of the science attach� overseas is to interact in science and technology at
                    the policy level. Things like what is their policy on protection of scientific
                    information, what is their policy on environmental issues? Doing what every
                    Foreign Service officer does in his area; namely, trying to make the climate for
                    U.S. policy as positive as possible and trying to bring the host government
                    along as far as possible to compatible policy positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Now the area of commercial things was very important in my own mind because it's
                    something we were very attuned to in the AEC. It happened, maybe it was in my
                    mind even when I went, that Argentina was at a critical stage in its nuclear
                    program from the commercial point of view. At that point in time, Argentina was
                    in the process of getting international tenders for their second nuclear power
                    plant. They had ordered their first plant and were well along in building it
                    when I got there. They bought their first plant from Germany, and the AEC was
                    very much involved in that in that in a number of ways. The AEC had to supply
                    heavy water to them because the Germans had no heavy water. It was always a
                    source of annoyance to a number of us that the Germans sold them a heavy water
                    reactor, knowing that Argentina had no heavy water to put in it. The Germans
                    assumed, without ever coordinating or talking with us, that we would supply it.
                    The position that I took as AEC Assistant General Manager for International
                    Activities was that, despite the unfair aspects of the German sale, it was in
                    the U.S. interest to provide the heavy water; the AEC commissioners agreed and
                    we did so. I still believe this was the correct decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Canada would be the supplier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: No. At that time, the Canadians, too, were depending on us for heavy
                    water. Later the Canadians produced their own, and that's relevant to what
                    happened in Argentina. We were, for many years, the only source of supply of
                    heavy water. We were widely suspected of wanting to monopolize the enriched
                    uranium business, which was not necessarily incorrect, but the reality was that
                    without even really trying to do so, we were the only source of supply of heavy
                    water. The Canadians and Germans and others who were out selling heavy water
                    reactors were relying on us to supply the heavy water. There was a lot of
                    opposition to our doing so for that German reactor. We finally decided, and this
                    was something I was directly involved in while at AEC, that it was better for us
                    to do it. If we withheld it, it in effect destroyed this very expensive project
                    for the Argentines. That would have been the end of the road for us in Argentina
                    and would also have tended to discredit us and the Atoms for Peace program.</p>
                <p>When I got to Argentina, the competition on the second project was just
                    beginning. The Germans, the Canadians, and the U.S. were the competitors. At
                    that time, the Germans were pretty much out of it because their reactor was
                    economically unattractive. The Canadians were in it and, by that time, had begun
                    to produce heavy water so they could supply it. It was very intensive
                    competition, and we did our best to promote the potential U.S. supplier,
                    Westinghouse. The Argentines, true to form, decided to buy another heavy water
                    reactor, which was one of the sources of concern. In our view, it was not the
                    right reactor for the country in economic terms, but the fact is, they wanted a
                    reactor that didn't depend on U.S. enriched uranium. We used to kid them that
                    they were becoming highly dependent on heavy water from one source of supply,
                    namely, Canada but that didn't bother them as much as becoming dependent on us
                    for enriched uranium. They bought the Canadian reactor, which has performed
                    satisfactorily.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Argentine government at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: At the time, the Argentine government was actually the last of the
                    series of military governments that had displaced Peron in the mid-1950s. I've
                    forgotten when he left the first time. Now, toward the end of our two-year stay,
                    that government, which was headed by a general named Lanusse, under tremendous
                    public pressure, decided to hold an election. Shortly before we left, the
                    election was held and a non-entity who was in fact a stand-in for Peron was
                    elected and began to serve. I think the day that we were leaving, or maybe a day
                    or two before, Peron and his then wife returned to Argentina. I have forgotten
                    the exact sequence of events after we left. I guess Peron became the president,
                    and she became the vice president. After a period of time, he died and then she
                    became the president. Then she was displaced by still another military
                    government. During my stay, 1971-1973, they were very severe times for the
                    Argentines and rather unsafe times for foreign diplomats and businesspeople.
                    There were kidnappings, some just for ransom, but others of a political nature.
                    One of the U.S. military attaches' homes was bombed. It was not a good
                    situation, but that's not why we left. We were never threatened or felt any
                    security risk personally but it was not secure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much in the way of scientific exchange there? I
                        woulhave thought things would have been relatively slow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: It was not an intensive post in that sense, other than nuclear science,
                    which was quite active because of the competition that I mentioned. Yes, there
                    was scientific exchange, mostly at the academic level. There were a number of
                    U.S. firms that were active in Argentina, General Electric, and so on. I made a
                    point of keeping in touch with them. There was also a considerable amount of
                    policy level activity in the form of efforts on the part of the Argentines to
                    influence the nature of the technology transfer arrangements between them and
                    the U.S. or any donor country. Their position was that they were a Third World
                    country when it came to something they wanted badly. Of course, they were an
                    advanced European-oriented country when they wanted to play it differently.
                    Their basic position was that technology should be more or less freely available
                    to them without regard to royalties or patent rights because they needed it and
                    because they were behind. It never reached the level of high policy but it was a
                    constant issue, and there was a Latin American meeting in Brazil that I attended
                    which, by the standards of those days in that part of the world, was of some
                    importance on technology transfer and the like. Generally, Argentina was not an
                    area of great activity.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I'll give you an example of the kind of thing that comes up from time to time
                    that you can't predict but certainly creates a considerable amount of
                    interesting work for a science counselor or science attach�. While I was there,
                    we launched Sky Lab. That was the first of the large orbiting laboratories. It
                    wasn't the shuttle but it was the third stage of a large booster rocket. In any
                    event it was a rather long-term U.S. orbiting laboratory, as the name implies,
                    and there had to be a tracking and communications station in the South Atlantic.
                    The logical place for this was Argentina. The tracking station took the form of
                    a ship that belonged to NASA, a fair sized ship with all sorts of antennas on
                    it, which made it look like an intelligence or spy ship. It wasn't, but it
                    looked like one. Of course, for the ship to be home-ported in an Argentine port
                    required Argentine government approval. That became a cooperative project of the
                    naval attach� and myself, primarily me, and it took a little bit of doing to get
                    the Argentines to let it be stationed there, but they finally agreed to it.</p>
                <p>Another project that came up was their desire to, in effect, lease to us an
                    island with a landing strip on the Argentine portion of the Antarctic Peninsula.
                    They invited a number of us to go down there. What they wanted from the U.S., in
                    exchange for U.S. right of use of the strip, was for the U.S. to improve the
                    strip by laying a surface on it. It was not to be concrete but a type of mesh
                    surface that was used during World II and maybe beyond. I don't know whether
                    that was ever done because the project wasn't completed by the time I left. I
                    got involved in that because one of the rationales for it was scientific
                    interest in Antarctica and the like. It could have been useful to the National
                    Science Foundation as a staging point for their activities in the Antarctic. In
                    fact, the Antarctic, in general, was an area of interaction, scientifically,
                    with the Argentines because of the Antarctic Treaty and the extensive U.S.
                    research program there. There was work to be done but I couldn't argue that it
                    was the center point of our overseas science activities. I don't know whether we
                    have a science counselor there at the present time. My instincts are that in an
                    era of budgetary tightness, you could dispense with it. Having occupied the job,
                    however, I couldn't say that we didn't get value received for whatever
                    maintaining the post might cost.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved in 1973 to a place that must have been much
                        moractive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Right.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>KRATZER: I was in Japan from 1973 to 1975. That was to be a somewhat longer
                    assignment but in 1975 I was asked to return to the Department to be deputy to
                    Dixie Lee Ray, who after having been chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission
                    became the first assistant secretary of the new bureau of Oceans and
                    Environmental Science when the AEC was dissolved. I don't know whether I was
                    required to take the job of deputy assistant secretary, but I thought it was a
                    sensible decision to make.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1973 to 1975 who was the ambassador to Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: The ambassador, when I arrived, was Bob Ingersoll, who later became
                    deputy secretary. He was from the private sector, an industrialist, and a very
                    fine gentleman. He left about mid-way through my two years there and was
                    replaced by Jim Hodgson but pronounced “Hodson.” He was a nice gentleman but I
                    think somewhat less active as ambassador than Ingersoll had been. He had been
                    Secretary of Labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, Japan in those days was full of development
                        ielectronics? What were your concerns there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Let me give you an anecdote, one which helps answer that question and
                    which helps illustrate change that Herman brought about in the whole program of
                    embassy science counselors. I was preceded by a gentleman named Bob Hyatt who
                    had been president of the University of Hawaii. I forgot what his field of
                    science was but he was a recognized scientist. Shortly before I got out there,
                    there was about a two-month hiatus. Hyatt had already left to become president
                    of the University of Alaska. That's kind of a switch in climates! I knew Bob
                    quite well, and he was a fine person but I don't think he saw the job in the
                    same way that Herman did. When I got there, I discovered that an agreement was
                    being negotiated which was of some importance in the U.S. view. It was an
                    agreement with the Japanese government on energy research and development. The
                    responsible officer in the embassy was the commercial counselor or commercial
                    attach�, and I was, to put it mildly, upset by this. I thought that this was my
                    responsibility, and I began making phone calls back to SCI and Herman and
                    others. To make a long story short, the responsibility was changed and assigned
                    to me. We did negotiate a useful cooperative program in energy research and
                    development. I should have added that I did not carry with me out there the
                    responsibility of AEC scientific representative, because there was already an
                    AEC scientific representative there that I had worked closely with while I was
                    at the Atomic Energy Commission and in fact had assigned there. While he was, to
                    some extent, autonomous, there was, in effect, a little science office which, as
                    science counselor, I headed. It included this gentleman, the AEC scientific
                    representative, and two National Science Foundation people. Before I came there
                    was also a representative of National Institutes of Health. That position was
                    discontinued but later, largely at the initiative of the Office of Naval
                    Research [ONR], but with my support, we set up an ONR office that included two
                    or three scientists. It did not focus on military matters but on general science
                    matters of interest to the office of naval research that perhaps had a naval
                    aspect but were basically scientific. The science counselor's office was a
                    multiperson office and I, for the first time, had a junior FSO assistant. It all
                    adds up to the proposition that it was a pretty active place. While I was there,
                    one example of what one does was this negotiation of an agreement on energy
                    research and development.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Another area toward the end of my stay that became very important and for which I
                    took responsibility in the embassy was the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. This
                    organization existed from 1945 or 1946 onward. This was a joint U.S.-Japan
                    scientific program to study the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, following
                    them medically to see what was happening, to see what the incidence of various
                    diseases was, and so on. It was very important scientifically but also very
                    sensitive politically. At the beginning, we paid 100 percent of this. As time
                    went on and Japan became more affluent, we became a little less willing to pay
                    the full cost. We began to feel that they ought to fund a good part of it, maybe
                    all of it. To make a long story short, while I was there, the Atomic Energy
                    Commission re-negotiated the terms of reference of that body. Its name was
                    changed to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation and the funding formula was
                    renegotiated. I was the local embassy representative and an active participant
                    in the negotiations by which we were able to reduce very substantially our cost
                    of running the thing. It was an expensive operation in those days. I believe
                    that the successful outcome of this negotiation was a major factor in my being
                    requested by Dr. Ray to return to Washington to serve as her deputy.The
                    environment became an active issue while we were in Japan. The whole proposition
                    of Japanese progress, which we saw very readily, was well along when I got there
                    but it really built up steam. It didn't take a rocket scientist to see that they
                    were outstripping us, particularly in consumer electronics, and I reported on
                    this. I don't know who read my reports, but I reported extensively on this.</p>
                <p>There was a very interesting event that took place while I was there. Boeing had
                    been involved in the development of a supersonic transport. That was in effect
                    terminated by U.S. government action because of environmental concerns about it.
                    It wouldn't have much effect now, but that termination put a considerable dent
                    in Boeing's prospects. As a result, Boeing was looking for partners to develop
                    the next plane, which they then called the 7x7. I'm not sure, but it may have
                    become the 737. In any event, Boeing was in the process of developing a
                    partnership with the Japanese aircraft industry, which was not a very active or
                    advanced industry by world standards because Boeing needed help in the funding.
                    It struck the Japanese as very curious that a private firm, Boeing, would be
                    able to risk U.S. leadership in civil aviation, without any real consideration
                    and approval by the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>I was generally concerned that the Japanese were getting a lot of U.S. technology
                    for very little; that they were getting U.S. technology largely through
                    effective negotiation and playing off one potential supplier against the other,
                    at very little cost. They were scouring the world, and that meant primarily us,
                    for technology. They weren't self-sufficient at that time in the development of
                    technology. They were exceedingly good then and, of course, now at adaptation
                    and improvement but they generally derived their basic technology from other
                    places, primarily the U.S. This was true in space when they started their space
                    program with U.S. help. It was true in many areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I thought then and still do that you can't keep other countries out of these
                    advanced things, and it makes sense to cooperate with them, but on a carefully
                    thought-out basis of mutual benefit. I do have reservations about how well the
                    government can run things like this, but I think there has to be a degree of
                    governmental involvement in terms of which technology is made available and on
                    what terms. That didn't exist. We were not really, in my view, getting what we
                    were entitled to for transferring this large volume of technology. In any event,
                    I felt that things were going on that people didn't understand at home. I guess
                    that everybody in the field tends to have the feeling that headquarters isn't
                    listening and I had that feeling in that position. The point I am trying to make
                    is that there is a lot of science and technology policy regardless of what side
                    you might take and how you report it. There was a lot of that happening between
                    the U.S. and Japan then, and I'm sure it still is.</p>
                <p>Q: You are saying this is pretty much one-sided as far as technology is
                    concerned. Was it that the Japanese had management techniques which, at least in
                    those days, was working well? That's what gave them the edge?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I think, frankly, there was a certain amount of naivety on the
                    part of the U.S. suppliers of technology. I don't think that they fully took
                    into account the extent to which the Japanese could attain scientific
                    predominance - technological, I think, is a better word - by exploiting and
                    often improving on the technology they got. In other words, I don't think we
                    fully understood that we were putting a competitor into business. I don't think
                    we, as a country, or our industry, were being properly compensated for that
                    risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact between you and, say, the
                        commerciaoffice to alert American business of what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I think the answer is there probably could have been and should have
                    been more. I didn't have any problems with the commercial people other than the
                    initial one of finding them running the energy research and development
                    negotiation and we were good friends, but I don't think that was the way they
                    saw their job. The answer is there was very little. I would write my messages
                    and airgrams, and I don't recall, in general, that I felt the need for any
                    clearances from them.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I'll give you another example of this, IBM. The details were very complicated
                    even then, and I certainly don't pretend to remember them all now. IBM was
                    obviously, in those days, more than dominant in the U.S. computer industry. It
                    was pretty much the whole game. It was quite unusual, but IBM had a wholly-owned
                    Japanese subsidiary, which was in existence when I got there. Japan was a lot
                    more closed to foreign investment then than it is now. It was just not done.
                    They preferred technology licenses for their firms to foreign-owned subsidiaries
                    and in the computer business had Japanese licenses, but IBM had a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary. In exchange for that, IBM had agreed to license all of their
                    technology and all of their patents to Japan for a period of time. There was
                    also an arrangement, whereby, for every computer which IBM imported into Japan,
                    there had to be, say, two built in Japan by IBM Japan. It was a clear effort, on
                    the part of the Japanese to use the IBM arrangement to create a Japanese
                    computer industry, which is natural. IBM knew that this was happening but felt
                    it was worth it to have a share of the Japanese market. They also agreed that
                    there would be a certain amount of export activity by IBM Japan, maybe to the
                    U.S. I know that there were IBM people posted out there from the States that
                    thought that the arrangement was not a good deal for IBM. My point is that I
                    don't think anyone in the U.S. government had a clue that this type of thing was
                    taking place. I did report on it. I have my doubts about the audience, but it
                    seemed to me then and it seems to me now that these are things of enough
                    importance that somebody in the U.S. government ought be aware of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Japanese commercial people and officials that
                        yowould call on? How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: First of all, I had a wide acquaintance with the nuclear community
                    before I went to Japan. I tried to keep that up even though there was an AEC
                    scientific representative. The other people I met in all of the Japanese
                    government departments and in the companies couldn't have been nicer. I had a
                    local employee who was a competent interpreter. I couldn't have done it without
                    him. Not so much to communicate with the responsible officials, because a lot of
                    them spoke acceptable English, but just to set things up and to go through
                    secretaries who didn't speak English would have been totally out of the question
                    without local interpretation. I had good relations. I still admire the Japanese
                    and have continuing contacts with many of their nuclear people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular points of conflict that you
                        goinvolved in between the Japanese government and ourselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KRATZER: The most significant thing that took place while I was there was the
                    final Japanese decision to ratify the NPT, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. They
                    had signed it earlier but, for a variety of reasons, held off their
                    ratification. I had a friend in the Japanese nuclear community that I kept in
                    close touch with. I don't think that I had much to do with their eventual
                    ratification, but I certainly had a useful contact. It was useful for them to
                    know from people, including me, that their ratification of the NPT continued to
                    be important to the U.S. I don't think we had any major outright disagreements
                    other than my feeling that what was happening was not being paid a great deal of
                    attention to in Washington. It was just a feeling that they were rapidly gaining
                    on us in a lot of fields, which is fair game, but largely as a result of the
                    base of U.S. technology that they were very consciously using. There was nothing
                    unconscious about this process.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you make this known? Obviously, you were writing your reports in but how
                    about other contacts within the embassy? Was this picked up as a theme?</p>
                <p>KRATZER: I don't think so. Perhaps that was a feasible avenue to express my
                    concerns, but I guess I didn't see it that way at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure. I probably would have gone but I am just
                        wondering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I don't think it would have gone very far, but I really didn't try.
                    Another nuclear area that I had gotten involved in, which was a presidential
                    initiative on our side, was uranium enrichment. At that time, the balance of
                    payments thing was heating up, and there were a number of efforts being made to
                    help reduce the trade deficit. One of these involved the proposition that we
                    might get the Japanese to invest in a private uranium enrichment activity in the
                    United States. That may have been a couple of billion dollar investment. It was
                    big enough for the president and prime minister to talk about. I became actively
                    involved in the discussions on that, which were between the private U.S. company
                    involved, Bechtel, and the Japanese. There were a lot of interesting projects
                    but I would characterize them in two ways, at least in terms of whether I found
                    them interesting and found them worthy of reporting and spending significant
                    amounts of time on: first, if they were really not science but technology;
                    second, if they had policy implications. Anything in the nuclear field has
                    policy implications, sometimes of a non-proliferation nature. The business of
                    the rate of progress, that is our competitive standing with each other, also has
                    policy implications. I don't for a moment think that I was the one who
                    discovered it, but the whole issue of competitiveness with the rest of the world
                    and Japan, in particular, became a really major issue in the U.S. several years
                    later. I think it happened to some extent because we didn't keep our eye on
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Japan was at that time a really closed
                        market?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Oh yes. Sure. I never knew how they accomplished it. Anyone who spent
                    time there believed this was true. You didn't see U.S. goods except in rare
                    circumstances, especially in those days. You could buy their goods cheaper in
                    the U.S. or in the PX than the Japanese could buy them in their own outlets.</p>
                <p>One of the small but very significant outcomes of my assignment in Japan took
                    place on a trip home from Japan. There was a conference of U.S. science
                    counselors and attach�s from around the world. I told Herman Pollack during the
                    conference that I thought he ought to rename what were then called generally the
                    science counselors to science and technology counselors. He did not delay. He
                    thought that was a legitimate point and he did that. To the best of my
                    knowledge, they are now called science and technology counselors or maybe
                    minister counselors, I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time from 1973-1975, was it a matter of
                        somfrustration you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Oh, no. I wouldn't put it in those terms. I was just trying to address
                    the question of what I thought was important and interesting. There was so much
                    to do that I didn't have time to be frustrated. I'm sure I must have been having
                    feelings about who is reading my reports. I guess I still wonder, but I think I
                    know now a little bit better than I knew then what some of the obstacles are to
                    action in fields like this. It is very complicated. I still think - and I don't
                    know the answer to it - that reporting by science counselors or science and
                    technology counselors requires that a considerably higher level of attention has
                    to be achieved for anything to be done. The whole issue of competitiveness, that
                    became so prominent, is still unsolved, though now we think we have solved all
                    the problems. I don't believe we have. I think there is still a major gap in
                    many areas. Everything looks good because our economy is healthy and theirs
                    seems not to be, but I can't believe that we can continue to have something like
                    a $200 billion trade deficit, of which $30 or $40 billion is with Japan,
                    indefinitely. I don't think that's sustainable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in 1975, you were invited back. This was to
                        becoma Deputy Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the new bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>KRATZER: Right. It was for the new Bureau oOceans and International and
                    Environmental and Scientific Affairs. We called it OES. This was a bureau that
                    was created by statute, as the people who passed the statute were careful to
                    point out. In that sense, although it was an outgrowth of Herman's science
                    bureau, OES really was the invention of Senator Pell from Rhode Island who
                    incidentally had been a Foreign Service officer and who was very interested in
                    oceans. He was the promoter of the statute that created a bureau that had
                    “oceans” in its title. If I am not mistaken, the legislation specified that it
                    would be headed by an Assistant Secretary, which Herman was not. The first
                    Assistant Secretary was Dixie Lee Ray, who had been chairman of the Atomic
                    Energy Commission before it was divided into the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
                    and the Energy Research and Development Administration. She thought that she
                    should get one of those two jobs as a sort of logical consequence of having been
                    the last chairman of the AEC. She didn't get it, so she came to State with maybe
                    a little bit of a chip on her shoulder. She was a very interesting character. I
                    thought very highly of her but she had her interesting points. The bureau was
                    created, at least she took it over as first assistant secretary, about the first
                    of January at the same time as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy
                    and Research and Development Administration were created out of the former
                    Atomic Energy Commission. I got there probably in March of 1975 and, by May, she
                    announced her decision to leave and did leave to run for governor of Washington,
                    which she won. She served one term and then couldn't get re-nominated because of
                    her somewhat interesting characteristics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never met the lady but was told that she wasn't a very
                        good fiat the State Department. Could you explain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: Some of this is anecdotal. She did come with a certain amount of a chip
                    on her shoulder because she thought that she should have a somewhat higher job.
                    People claimed that when she was offered the job of Assistant Secretary at State
                    that she thought that she would be the assistant secretary, not one of 10 or
                    whatever the number was. I find that hard to believe. She was not a career
                    bureaucrat and maybe she did lack some knowledge of the bureaucratic ins and
                    outs. She did say to me on more than one occasion, “Well, when I leave you'll be
                    a better bureaucrat than I am.”</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Let me give you an anecdote. When I got back, she had offered me the job of
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary. It was understood that it was to cover nuclear
                    matters. In fact, it was understood on her part that it was to cover energy
                    technology with nuclear matters most prominently included but energy technology
                    in general. The job had no title but I don't know if it was customary even then
                    for deputy assistant secretary jobs to have a specific title other than deputy
                    assistant secretary. For one reason or another, she thought, and I thought, that
                    it would be best to have such a title with energy displayed in it. I got back
                    and she said, “I got some disturbing news. The Assistant Secretary for EB,” who
                    was Tom Enders, a big tall fellow, “is objecting to this.” He says that energy
                    is his business. I said, “He is in the economic and commercial aspects of
                    energy. I'm dealing with energy technology.” She said, “I can't get anywhere
                    with him.” So, I went down to see him and it took about five minutes and the
                    problem was solved. I became the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy
                    and Energy Technology Affairs, and he had no problem with that. She personalized
                    every thing. She was good at substance. That was not her shortcoming, but she
                    would become involved in a disagreement with somebody, and it soon turned into,
                    “This guy is a fool.” That was her shortcoming. That's why she didn't get
                    re-nominated and re-elected as governor of Washington. She was a delightful
                    person in many ways. Things weren't too clearly defined but I was always her
                    acting deputy when she was out. When she left, two or three months later, I
                    became acting for her for sometime, but I didn't pass on the nuclear
                    responsibility, which was my first interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues during this time that you
                        werthere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: In hindsight, perhaps I short-changed myself, but I really was just sort
                    of a caretaker in regard to everything except the nuclear side. There were
                    deputies for general science, for the environment, and for oceans. I really
                    didn't delve deeply into their responsibilities. I continued to do the nuclear
                    job, and while I was there the whole issue of non-proliferation became far more
                    active and attention getting than it ever had before. It was attention getting
                    at the top level of government. This was a result of several things.</p>
                <p>First of all, the Indian nuclear explosion took place in 1974, which said to
                    people that proliferation was a real and not just a theoretical problem. It had
                    sort of receded into the background because nothing had happened since the
                    French and Chinese explosions, and while they weren't welcome, they were
                    permanent members of the security council. The Indian nuclear explosion, though
                    it happened shortly before I got there, turned things around at the
                    congressional and senior policy levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>There were also extensive sales of what we regarded as dangerous
                    high-proliferation risk facilities, to Brazil, to Pakistan, and to South Korea.
                    These were very hot items. There were discussions that were just getting under
                    way with a group of five or six countries, the so-called nuclear suppliers.
                    These were to be held in London under UK auspices with the purpose of trying to
                    get agreement on common policies in terms of supply. In other words, none of us
                    would undercut each other from the standpoint of non-proliferation in selling
                    nuclear goods and services to other countries. The whole issue of
                    non-proliferation once again attracted very high-level attention. Those were the
                    days, for example, when the first legislation was passed that said, if any
                    country engaged in nuclear enrichment or in processing, we would lower the boom
                    on them. That was the so-called Symington amendment to, I guess probably, the
                    Foreign Relations Act, and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Act of 1978, which was
                    passed in 1978 after I left but on which most hearings were held while I was
                    still around. Yes, it was very, very active, and it was more than a full-time
                    job.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find Kissinger at times? Kissinger was renowned for having a focus
                    on some things and a non-focus on others. I was wondering how he dealt with
                    this.</p>
                <p>KRATZER: Well, I was told that, before I came back, Kissinger had expressed
                    himself as doubting whether it was our business. He had been turned around on
                    this as a result of such activities as I was describing, the sale of nuclear
                    goods to Brazil, South Korea, and so on. In any event by the time I got back he
                    was, I would say, generally on the non-proliferation band wagon. He was in tune
                    with national policy, but probably did not attach as high a priority to it as
                    did others, especially on the Hill.</p>
                <p>A day or two after I started, he was holding a meeting - I can't remember the
                    subject matter - which probably had to do with proliferation, but I'm not even
                    sure of that. Dixie said to me, “You go up there.” One of her stocks in trade
                    was to say that she could never get to see the Secretary. It wasn't true as far
                    as I know. I don't know that she was ever turned down. The meeting started, and
                    I had never seen Kissinger other than on television. I'm sure he had never seen
                    me, and he looked around the room and said, “Where's Dixie?” There were 20
                    people in the room and the only person he didn't see that he thought should be
                    there was Dixie. There are two sides to that story. I said that she had other
                    business, or something.</p>
                <p>I was far from a confidante of the Secretary, but I did have substantial contact.
                    I went with him to Pakistan when he attempted to talk Bhutto into not going
                    ahead with reprocessing. We did not know at that time that they were also
                    working on enrichment. Maybe they weren't yet, but if they weren't already, then
                    they were shortly afterwards. Kissinger clearly was trying to implement U.S.
                    policy.</p>

                <p>When Nixon was still in office, which was before I returned, he had made a trip
                    to the Middle East. He went to Israel and Egypt, and had offered to provide
                    nuclear reactors to each country. I don't know if anyone knows what the exact
                    words really were. He certainly didn't mean a grant because, if he had meant it,
                    he couldn't have delivered on giving them away. But, it was appropriate that we
                    would enter into agreements with them that would allow them to buy reactors from
                    the United States, which, up to that time, they hadn't been able to do. The
                    Israelis had one of our research reactors. But it wasn't foreseen that Israel
                    and Egypt were the right kind of countries to receive power reactors because of
                    their rivalry and adversary status. We did successfully negotiate with both the
                    Egyptians and the Israelis very unique agreements that we thought might get past
                    Congress. These nuclear agreements have to be reviewed by the Congress. They
                    never were passed because the election changed all that. The point is that
                    Kissinger was directly involved in that when Sadat came over. Kissinger made the
                    major policy decisions. When one looks at those, they sort of split the
                    difference. In other words, he shaded what many people thought should be the
                    non-proliferation policy vis-a-vis Israel and the Middle East just by being
                    willing to enter into agreements, particularly with Israel, which didn't require
                    the Israelis to put Dimona under international safeguards. They were tightly
                    written agreements under which Israel and Egypt would not be permitted to
                    reprocess, or, in other words, to extract the plutonium from any of the fuels in
                    these reactors. If the agreements had come into being, the Israelis and the
                    Egyptians would have been able to buy reactors and fuel from us, but that did
                    not come to pass.</p>
                <p>A major issue that came up, shortly after I came back, was the issue of fuel for
                    India. When the Indian nuclear explosion took place in 1974, we suspended
                    shipments of nuclear fuel to them until they agreed to cease making bombs
                    employing our fuel. They already had so agreed, but people wanted a certain
                    icing on the cake. Kissinger suspended the nuclear fuel agreements that we had
                    to fuel their first nuclear power reactor until they gave us further assurances
                    that they wouldn't use it in bombs. They gave us those assurances, and the State
                    Department's position was that we should go ahead and resume fuel shipments. I
                    was the officer largely responsible for making that decision, although,
                    obviously, it got the support and concurrences it needed in the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>By that time the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had come into being, and it was
                    given - probably initially as almost a drafting error in the drafting of the
                    legislation that created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission - the export
                    licensing authority that the Atomic Energy Commission previously had. This was a
                    crucial development because the NRC was an independent regulatory body to which
                    the administration couldn't say, “We want to export this, so approve it.” They
                    had a procedure that had to be met before an export license could be granted,
                    which involved the opportunity for public comment and then public intervention
                    in a sort of judicial proceeding. This was the first export license in which
                    there was public intervention. This led to a hearing before the NRC for a period
                    of weeks. I testified for about a day, about eight hours spread over a couple of
                    days. They finally did issue the license to India. All licenses to India after
                    that were turned down. In fact, some of them actually became a matter of
                    congressional action, and I believe they were either turned down or approved
                    subject to conditions. The agreement with India has now expired but, even before
                    it expired, we discontinued exporting nuclear fuel to India. There were all
                    sorts of things going on, mostly related to nuclear proliferation. That was
                    really the focal point of my tour as deputy assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning, off mike, that on January 20, 1977
                        thCarter administration came in. How did that hit your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: I had reached the conclusion in my own mind that I should not continue.
                    I assumed that that would be the conclusion that the new administration reached.
                    I'm trying to remember when I was so informed by the incoming administration. I
                    honestly can't remember whether it was before or after that date. I do remember
                    exactly who told me and where it took place. Joe Nye had been designated by this
                    time - I don't know how he could have been confirmed before actual nomination -
                    but maybe it was a job that didn't require confirmation. Joe Nye had come into
                    the Department, I think his title was Assistant to the Under Secretary for
                    Non-Proliferation. He was to be the nuclear non-proliferation czar. The title
                    didn't sound like terribly much, but he was the nuclear non- proliferation czar.
                    I had met Joe previously. He was a professor at Harvard. He is now the head of
                    the Kennedy School. Until fairly recently, he had been in the Clinton
                    administration as, I guess, Assistant Secretary of Defense Policy, or something.
                    He is a man of considerable parts and had very strong views on
                    non-proliferation. Joe came by my office and said, “I've been thinking about
                    this, and we feel that, because our policies are so different, we need to have
                    somebody else promoting them.” I said, “I agree.” So that was how that came
                    about, and I stayed on roughly a month but had de facto relinquished my
                    responsibilities to other people. I left the Department and that was as it
                    should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the normal thing. Then you actually retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KRATZER: I retired with career status, as far as I know. I don't think I lost
                    that. I think I was told that, if I wished to stay, there was a position in
                    London as a science counselor. I didn't even really consider it. I just decided
                    it was time to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went into private...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KRATZER: ...private industry and worked nearly 10 years in a private firm. Then,
                    I retired from that, but still do a limited amount of consulting and lead a
                    fairly active life. I'm still connected with non-proliferation and nuclear
                    safeguards, including working as a consultant to the Nuclear Regulatory
                    Commission, which is very much engaged in safeguards in the international as
                    well as domestic safeguards area. I speak fairly frequently on non-proliferation
                    in nuclear affairs and nuclear safeguards.</p>
                <p>I must say that I am somewhat alarmed by some of the things that have happened
                    quite recently, particularly in Iraq, if you can believe the reports. I haven't
                    heard anyone question them. I don't believe everything I read but if it is not
                    questioned there is good reason to believe they are more or less accurate.
                    Apparently, we have advised the Security Council that they should go easy on
                    Iraq in enforcing the inspection rights that were given to the Special
                    Commission. I think that has very serious implications, not just for the Iraqi
                    situation, but for the whole future of verification. If we're going to pull the
                    rug out from under the inspectors, then we are not going to have a verification
                    machine that's up to snuff. If the UN and IAEA inspectors can't rely on us as at
                    least an advocate, if not a protector of their rights that they have been given
                    by agreement and Security Council action, that is really serious.</p>
