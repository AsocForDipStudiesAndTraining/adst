                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 31, 2003. This is an interview with
                        Marten van Heuven. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by
                        Marten?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we start at the beginning? Could you tell me when and
                        where you were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was born in Europe in the Netherlands in a city called Utrecht,
                    best known for the Peace of Utrecht of 1713. I was the first child of parents
                    who both came from Utrecht. My father was an eye surgeon. My mother studied law
                    but never practiced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what year were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: In 193Utrecht was a university city. Since both my father and mother
                    had degrees from the University, my family was part of the Utrecht nomenklatura.
                    On my father's side my ancestors for several centuries were teachers. On my
                    mother's side, my grandfather was also a doctor. His parents were farmers. So
                    mine was a very Dutch family. We were comfortable at the time I was born, the
                    crash of '29 had not affected my parents. But at that time - and I wasn't aware
                    of it then - the Nazi threat in Germany was already evident. In due course, my
                    father thought he saw the war coming. He was British oriented because he used to
                    go to ophthalmological congresses in Oxford and had many English friends. He
                    considered leaving the Netherlands, but in the end the settledness of our
                    situation simply trumped the desire to go. So we stayed, something my father
                    regretted ever after. We went through World War II in Utrecht. I never saw any
                    fighting. Both in 1940 and 1945, fighting stopped just short of Utrecht. In May
                    of 1940, we avoided being hit by German bombardments. After the Germans
                    destroyed Rotterdam, Utrecht was next on the target list. We had been evacuated
                    to the center of the city, to a building used by Louis Napolean. Two hours
                    before sunset the Dutch armed forces capitulated and so Utrecht was spared.
                    Otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here to tell you this story.</p>
                <p>By 1947, my father had been back to England, and also to the United States.
                    There, he received several offers to teach and practice ophthalmology. He took
                    up the offer to go to the Yale medical school. On my 15th birthday, November 25,
                    1947, my mother, my brother, and I set sail for New York on the New Amsterdam.
                    My father had preceded us to the United States. A week later, we settled in our
                    new home in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to stop you and go back. What was life like in
                        Utrecht during the German occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: At first it was not all that noticeable. I was 8 at the time, so my
                    memory is that of a boy. What I remember most was the last year. The Allies
                    attempted to liberate all of Holland in September 1944 with an airborne attack
                    involving the 101st, the 82nd, and the 1st British airborne. The attempt to take
                    the bridge at Arnhem failed. The other landings succeeded. The result was that
                    the south of the Netherlands was liberated and we were not. At that point,
                    things really turned bad. They had already become bad for the Jewish population
                    in the Netherlands, who had experienced roundups starting in 1942. And they had
                    become bad for others, such as the young men who had been in the army, who had
                    been shipped off to work camps. But these events did not affect me directly, nor
                    did they affect my father's practice directly. But in September of 1944, the
                    Germans requisitioned all able-bodied men. Schools closed because there were no
                    more teachers. Then, from all 1944 to May 1945, we went through a cold winter.
                    There were no more cars on the road. Bicycles were also requisitioned by the
                    Germans. The trains had stopped running. People stayed in place. Some of them
                    had a very bad time, both with the cold and lack of food. Because my father was
                    a doctor and had patients from the countryside, there was a supply of food that
                    kept us going. Not everybody was that fortunate. I remember times when we would
                    get a couple of sacks of potatoes from a farmer patient and then redistributed
                    them to people whom we knew and who needed them. There was also a pervasive
                    element of fear, because at that point not only the German military occupation
                    but basically the exercise of civilian authority by the Germans had come to rest
                    on informants. The whole atmosphere was extremely hostile. The risk of doing a
                    whole lot of things was enormous - listening to the BBC, picking up the leaflets
                    that the allied bombers would drop overnight. The exercise of German authority
                    was arbitrary. We lived from hand to mouth. You really couldn't trust
                    anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think particularly for a boy around 12 it would be
                        a trial for the parents to keep somebody like that from not doing something
                        that could really cause problems. Kids are very adventurous and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That's a very American way of looking at the situation. But let me
                    assure you there was no adventurism whatsoever. Since 1940 we had experienced
                    all sorts of restraints and we knew from family experience just how bad things
                    could get. An uncle of mine was picked up by the Germans when hiding in my
                    grandfather's country house. The Dutch word was “onderduiker.” He was an
                    “onderduiker.” He had basically disappeared from view. But they tracked him down
                    and he spent the rest of the war in a camp. His wife, a schoolteacher, later on
                    used an unflattering word about the Germans. One of the kids in her school told
                    the parents, and she ended up for a year in jail in the city of Groningen. So,
                    right in the family, we knew that risks were all around you. Authority was
                    capricious, arbitrary, and potentially lethal. It was lethal right until the end
                    of the war, when my mother's nephew, who was active in the resistance at the
                    time when the Germans were capitulating, incautiously decided he would reveal
                    himself, put on the orange armband, and start trying to carry a message across
                    town to allied lines. He was captured and summarily executed. Had he waited 24
                    hours, he would be alive. Those things made you very cautious. You knew even as
                    a 12-year-old boy that this was not a game, that what you did could cost your
                    parents' life. It could basically disrupt everything. So, caution absolutely
                    impregnated everything I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One knows of the retribution given to Nazi sympathizers in
                        France. Right after the German surrender, what happened in the Netherlands
                        with the Nazi sympathizers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was a very local issue. In Utrecht, there was an interregnum of
                    about two days between the German capitulation and the arrival of the Canadian
                    1st Army. The underground came out into the open. The Germans were still there.
                    The Dutch uniformed NSB, the Dutch Nazi party, were still out there in their
                    black shirts. Everybody was armed. There were firefights in some of the squares,
                    with casualties. After the war, there were trials and the Dutch quisling,
                    Mussert, was convicted and executed at the end of his trial. There was not a lot
                    of kangaroo justice. I think people were just simply too worn out by their
                    ordeal. It was not in the Dutch nature to practice kangaroo justice, although
                    the Dutch can harbor deep grudges. That was not the way you do things. But I
                    cannot sit here and tell you that kangaroo justice didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but it gives a feel for things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It must have been quite an adventure for you to arrive in the United States,
                    wasn't it, in '47?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The idea of leaving war-torn Europe and going to America was an
                    amazing prospect. It was not just the British, but also the Canadians and the
                    Americans who had come into Europe to chase the Nazi Germans out. The army side
                    of the liberation was Canadian, General Foulkes' 1st Army. But it was the
                    British Royal Air Force that flew the sorties. During the last year of the war
                    we witnessed every 24 hours huge overflights of bombers heading for Germany.
                    They dropped leaflets. So you were very aware of the war because it was being
                    waged in the air. You associated with those men who were flying those aircraft.
                    I remember watching from the back of the garden when one of them got hit, burst
                    into flames, and then crashed. Near our country place there were graves of some
                    British fliers who had been shot down and were buried pretty much where they
                    fell. You associated heavily with the Allies. So the notion of going to America
                    was a liberating prospect and a profoundly liberating experience. By
                    coincidence, I came upon an article in a newspaper published in Yakima,
                    Washington, in 1946. My father was taking a tour of medical schools in the
                    United States at that time. He had been invited on a lecture tour in his field,
                    ophthalmology. He was in Yakima visiting a distant cousin of my mother's. The
                    interviewer for the “Yakima News” asked him how he felt about being an American.
                    What struck me was my father's emphasis on the word “freedom.” He said, “Even
                    after the war, we don't really have it. People are still too afraid to talk to
                    each other because of what they have just been through. But here things are
                    free.” When a year and a half after arriving in the U.S. I graduated from
                    Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, there was an article in the New Haven
                    Register about me because I was the valedictorian. In that article, my English
                    teacher, Victor Reid, is quoted as saying: “When Marten came here, he mistook
                    our freedom for license and didn't understand that.” But what I realized again,
                    as I went through these two articles just a few weeks ago, is that the basic
                    theme of freedom must have run very deep in my father's mind and my mother's. It
                    certainly was part of my own makeup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Haven. Where did you go to school in New Haven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: First, I went tHopkins Grammar School, the second oldest secondary
                    school in the United States, founded in 1667. It was a boys school then. It was
                    also a day school. The fact that my younger brother and I went there was
                    entirely thanks to the headmaster, Dr. George Lovell. My family had been unable
                    in 1947 to take any money out of the Netherlands. There were still currency
                    restrictions of all sorts. So basically we had little money. My father was just
                    beginning a medical career in a new environment. George Lovell took my brother
                    and me on faith. We, of course, repaid that generosity subsequently, but at the
                    time it was just an extraordinary thing for Headmaster Lovell to do. Hopkins
                    then was a small school. There were probably no more than 50 students in my
                    class, four classes, 200 students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you studied any English before you came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: During the occupation, English was verboten. My father was British
                    oriented, so we had English books in the house. We also belonged to the Anglican
                    Church in Utrecht. After the war I had a little English in school. We also spent
                    six weeks in Torquay in the south of England in the summer of 1946 when my
                    father was ill and needed to recover. Torquay is a fairly bucolic place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are palm trees even.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There are palm trees in Torquay, that's right. So I had some English.
                    But from one week to the next in 1947, I had to switch from translating Latin
                    into Dutch to translating Latin into English. That actually was a helpful crutch
                    for learning English. But, as you can hear even today, though my command of
                    English is not something that gives me any concern, my accent is still
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are in an American school. Granted, it was more
                        of a traditional older prep-school-type school, did you find it different
                        than Dutch education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: It was a very different experience. My last year of French class
                    consisted of four students. We had advanced French, with Mr. De Noyon. Classes
                    in the Netherlands were 30-35. The whole atmosphere was totally different.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American students are encouraged generally to speak out
                        rather than to absorb. Was this true in this case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes, it was. Having small classes made it inevitable that you had
                    plenty of opportunities to participate in class discussion. This was certainly
                    the case in the language classes and in English class; less so, perhaps, in
                    chemistry, physics, or math. Hopkins was an old-fashioned boys school of the New
                    England variety, and the school system I came from was basically a continental
                    gymnasium, where there was a lot of rote learning. In some respects, this served
                    me well. The reason that my German and my French later became as good as they
                    did is because I had excellent basics, which I acquired before I came to the
                    United States. But my facility with these languages came much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the social life? How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, certainly in retrospect, but I think even then, my aim was to
                    do well in school. I was making lots of transitions - social, cultural, and also
                    educational. I spent all my energy on making these transitions. I had actually
                    jumped ahead a year, going from what would have been the sophomore class into
                    the junior class. Sixteen months later, I ended up with the highest grades in my
                    class. That was not something I was aiming for. This result was due to a
                    coefficient of grades. I just happened to edge out the others. I worked
                    extremely hard. I also did not have much social life. I did not go to school
                    dances. I wouldn't have known how to do that anyway. I did do sports as a member
                    of the Hopkins fencing team. But mostly I was just studying as hard as I could.
                    Only when I was admitted both to Dartmouth and Yale, and decided on Yale, things
                    changed because I did not stay home. I lived at Yale for the next four years in
                    College and three years at Yale Law School.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The four years in Yale were from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: They were from 1949 to 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Yale like then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Male. Today you would say somewhat paternalistic. It was a situation
                    I was very comfortable with because in my way of thinking it was still very open
                    and elastic and free flowing. By today's standards, that would not be the case.
                    It was extremely stimulating because there were nothing but icons around. The
                    venerated president Charles Seymour, later Whit Griswold; Dean Buck; the Yale
                    chaplain, Uncle Sid Lovell; my thesis adviser, Archie Foord, Master of Calhoun
                    College. Most were fabulous New Englanders, who were role models not just in
                    their subject but in their citizenry. They dressed and they lived the role of
                    New England gentlemen. There were obviously women there, too, but except for
                    Mrs. Denison, the secretary to the master of my college, Timothy Dwight, Mr.
                    Charles Sawyer, I cannot recall any woman at college whom I remember
                    particularly, because all my teachers were male. With the other members of the
                    Class of 1953, I remember an iron-willed lady by the name of Nancy, who oversaw
                    the Freshmen Commons dining hall. She brooked no nonsense from any of us and
                    insisted on decorum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was William Buckley doing his thing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Buckley did. He was three years ahead of me, Class of '50, author of
                    God and Man at Yale. It caused a bit of a campus stir. It may have caused more
                    of a stir among the graduates in New York. At school we sort of took it in
                    stride. The “Yale Daily News,” of course, gave it editorial and other attention.
                    But it was not one of the things that roiled the university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was the Class of '50 at Williams. “God, Man, and Yale”
                        caused quite a stir.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes, but from my point of view it was a limited stir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you got into Yale, what were you concentrating on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That question gives me occasion to note that I already knew when I
                    went to Yale pretty much what I wanted to do, though in my first year I
                    maintained the option of doing what my father and my uncles had done, namely to
                    become doctors. So I took premed courses as a freshman. But after freshman year,
                    I took the decision not to study medicine but to go in another direction. What
                    was that direction? The evidence for that direction is in the title of my
                    valedictory address in '49 at Hopkins, which was “Diplomacy Tomorrow.” I was 16
                    at the time. I just reread that speech this year. I would not agree with any of
                    the observations I made in that address about diplomacy. I admire the Hopkins
                    trustees and school faculty for sitting through the drivel that I fed up at the
                    time. It was pretty awful. But my interest was clear and that was my direction:
                    Diplomacy. At that time, it didn't mean the U.S. Foreign Service but it did mean
                    becoming a diplomat. By inference, I suppose I had to think of myself as an
                    American diplomat, although at that time I was still a Dutch national.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask about citizenship. How fare thee
                        citizenshipwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I became an American as soon as that was possible - that is to say,
                    five years plus a couple of months after my arrival. That turned out to be in
                    the spring of my senior year, in April 1953. My mother and brother and I were
                    naturalized in the District Court in New Haven, Connecticut. My father, who had
                    arrived in the U.S. earlier, had already become a citizen. In that process, I
                    also lost my Dutch citizenship. I mention that specifically because, against all
                    my expectations, the Department of State sent me back to The Hague years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the Hopkins School. What had inspired you
                        to talk on diplomacy? This is not a field that most young people think
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It had to do with growing up in a world at war, living in a country
                    under occupation, and being increasingly aware of the deplorable condition of
                    Europe and the world at that time. I gained the conviction - at that time it was
                    tantamount to a belief - that when all of this was over, the world had to learn
                    how to cooperate and, through multilateral institutions, and properly trained
                    people, avoid having another world war. So, it was my own view, or vision,
                    limited as it was, that what was needed now was to focus on how to put the world
                    back together again after World War II. That led to my interest in
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in college, from '46 to '50, there was a great
                        deal of emphasis and hope about the United Nations. The UN has waxed and
                        waned in feeling of value. At that time, it was very high. Did you get
                        enthusiastic about the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I did, and the enthusiasm became a lot more concrete shortly
                    afterwards when, in 1955, as a law student, I spent the summer as an intern at
                    the United Nations in the Office of the Legal Adviser. I was there with about 60
                    other young people from all over the world, all of whom had been allocated for
                    the summer to different parts of the UN Secretariat. Since I was a law student,
                    I was assigned to the General Legal Division, run by Oscar Schachter. Dag
                    Hammarskjold was Secretary General. He came to talk to our group, and I remember
                    meeting him at that time. By then, I was a firm supporter of, and believer in,
                    the United Nations.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm told that for many years the Dutch held the greatest resentment of any of
                    the surrounding countries toward the Germans. Did that permeate your family and
                    yourself at all?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The resentment was an element of Dutch attitudes for many years
                    following the war. It did not affect me so much because, by crossing the
                    Atlantic, I left the Germans behind. Among my parents' generation, the distaste
                    of the Germans, if not stronger, remained. A Dutch colleague of mine in the 1955
                    program told me that he never wanted ever to set foot in Germany. Later, I
                    watched the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the Dutch and the
                    Germans. I knew personally the first two German ambassadors in ThHague,
                    particularly Otto von der Gablenz, a wonderful man and a superb diplomat, whom I
                    got to know when I was at the embassy in Bonn and he worked in the office of
                    Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Both were extraordinarily talented men who did a
                    great deal to alleviate the ill feelings that still existed. In the '90s, there
                    was a poll that showed how resentful the Dutch still felt about the Germans.
                    This deeply concerned Chancellor Kohl. He and the then Dutch prime minister Wim
                    Kok arranged for Kohl to visit Rotterdam. During that visit, Kohl performed an
                    act of propitiation which, as far as the Dutch government was concerned, drew
                    the line under this issue. Meanwhile, Dutch business life had adjusted rapidly
                    to the fact that, for all practical purposes, the Netherlands is an extension of
                    the German economy. Rotterdam is the transshipment point for goods going in and
                    out of Germany. The Dutch business world had little compunctions about dealing
                    with Germans. So there was some ambivalence on that issue.</p>
                <p>Today, dislikes remain, but I suspect you could find as many Dutchmen who don't
                    like Belgians as Dutchmen who don't like Germans. The economic connection
                    between Germany and the Netherlands now is extraordinarily tight. So I conclude
                    that this issue is now mostly history.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were in Yale before you went to law school, had you done any study
                    of diplomacy of any nature? Was this something you were looking at?</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was a history major at Yale. I had taken history at Hopkins. I did
                    not take any courses in diplomacy. In fact, I doubt any were offered then. Even
                    in the one year at the Columbia School of International Affairs, following law
                    school, I did not take any courses in diplomacy as such. I took courses in
                    international economics, European history, and Chinese history. I was an
                    intensive major in history in college. My thesis focused on the French Communist
                    Party during the 14-month period from 1946 until they left the government in
                    1947. I wasn't reading memoirs of Metternich or Talleyrand. But I was certainly
                    focused on the diplomatic interactions of my day. I already had my own Rolodex
                    of international contacts. I spent the summer of 1951 at Sciences Po in Paris
                    and the summer of '52 at the Sorbonne. In '55, I was at the United Nations. I
                    spent the summer of 1956 at the Academy of International Law in The Hague. That
                    was not a very serious program, but it showed my interest. I did take
                    international law at Yale Law School with Myres McDougal. But McDougal was such
                    a theorist that it took those few of us who took his courses almost as much time
                    to understand his vocabulary than to really learn a lot about international law,
                    though I did plow through the standard international textbooks of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you studied the French Communist Party. The Cold
                        War had well developed by this time. What was your attitude toward the
                        Soviet Union and communism and particularly European communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I have to think for a moment to check myself on this. The communist
                    threat to the established order in Western Europe came to a crescendo the very
                    fall that we left for the United States, in 1947. There was the possibility of
                    electoral victory of the communists in Italy. There was the possibility that
                    France might turn because of the size of the communist party there. There were
                    ominous rumblings in Czechoslovakia. I must have sensed that there was a big
                    danger. To me, that underlined the importance of Europe for the United States.
                    But my feelings about communism were different than they were about Nazis,
                    because I had direct experience with them. There were no good sources of
                    information about the Soviet Union. During the war, the Nazis disseminated
                    propaganda that one tended to distrust. I don't think I knew a lot about the
                    Soviet Union and communism at the time. But I'm pretty sure that I regarded
                    communism as an undesirable danger, and I know that then I was aware that
                    leaders like Churchill felt that this was the next danger that had to be
                    confronted. But to me the threat had to do more with what communism could do to
                    Western Europe than what it could do within the realm of the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you went to France and did some studying during
                        the summer. Was this connected with your thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was not. I was 15 on the day I left the Netherlands. I was 20 when
                    I came back. It was time to see family in the Netherlands. But the main reason
                    was to go to France. You will remember that those were the days when it was
                    popular on every campus to go and study in France. I followed suit. It was a
                    program run by Yale Reid Hall, organized at Yale by Professor Anderson. I lived
                    in Reid Hall on the Rue de Chevreuse. During the school year, it was reserved
                    for women. For the summer, it was also for men. The Reid Hall program consisted
                    of students mostly from the East Coast, who took courses in French at the
                    Sorbonne for eight weeks and at Sciences Po. I remember Professor Jean Bernard
                    Duroselle. He was one of my teachers and became one of France's great names at
                    Sciences Po. It also helped me with my French.</p>
                <p>The next year I went to the Sorbonne. That was much less serious because the
                    Sorbonne is just like a big American university. I was not there with a program.
                    There were “cours pour des etrangers” (classes for foreigners) to which I
                    subscribed. I lived in the Cinquieme. I don't remember anything in particular
                    about course work. There were huge lecture halls. It was not nearly as intimate
                    as Sciences Po. There was no exam. So it was in that sense pretty much of a
                    lark, but it gave me another summer in Paris, which certainly helped my sense of
                    the city. In those two summers, I covered all of the arrondissements on foot,
                    and I got to know Paris very well. I had some contacts there. A family who had a
                    son my age were hospitable and I got to know some other young French. I got
                    around a little bit beyond Paris and felt extremely at home in Paris in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why law school? What attracted you to Yale Law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I did want to go on studying. The choice was simple. Either a Ph.D.
                    or law school. The Ph.D. would have restricted my options. Law school would have
                    enlarged them. Wanting to be a practitioner rather than a teacher, I chose law
                    school not because I liked law as such - I didn't really know whether I would
                    like it - but because it seemed to me that if you wanted to do international law
                    you had to do law and that would lead to the sort of things that I might want to
                    do. At law school, I discovered very quickly that you don't just do
                    international law, you do bread and butter law - contracts, torts, negotiable
                    instruments. In your spare time you can add an elective and that can be
                    international law. So I did all of that. I took the bar exam, was admitted in
                    Connecticut and later on, by motion, in the District of Columbia to the various
                    courts here. It was a superb education. Yale Law was probably as good a law
                    school as any in the world in those days. Did I like it as much as college? No.
                    What kept me sane was that I was a freshman counselor and I lived on the Old
                    Campus. I had 18 freshmen under my charge. Their antics gave me the sort of
                    lifeblood that I needed to be normal. But otherwise law school was pretty much
                    of a grind. And I was very young. I did not take any time off. I was the
                    youngest member of my class at Yale. I was the youngest member of my law class.
                    In retrospect, there are not a lot of things that I would do differently, but I
                    would have waited a year or two and then gone to law school. I would have got
                    more out of it at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes this age factor?. There is nothing like a good
                        small war or a draft for taking people out for a couple of years and then
                        putting them back in. They usually are more serious students.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, the draft did come along, but I was classified 4F. I also
                    applied for ROTC, first with the Navy and then the Air Force. But they turned me
                    down because of asthma and the draft didn't want me either for the same reason.
                    So, I never did any military service. I would have liked to. Military service
                    would also have validated my new Americanness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Yale Law School system different from the Harvard
                        system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was different and much was made of the difference. Harvard was
                    much larger. You could fit the entire Yale Law School into the freshman class at
                    Harvard. Secondly, Harvard had no exams until the end of your first year. Your
                    entire legal career was determined in just a few days; because you either made
                    law review or you didn't, your ranking in the class was determined, and hiring
                    practices started kicking in right in your sophomore year. Yale had exams in
                    January and in June. Harvard was a so-called “bread and butter” law school. Yale
                    was interested in the social implications of law as a tool to remake society.
                    The teaching method at Yale was exclusively case method. At Harvard, it was a
                    mix of case method and lectures. Interestingly, I find that both schools have
                    now gone back to lectures more than used to be the case. But the saying in New
                    Haven was that in three years at law school we never got an answer to a single
                    question. We always got a question in return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've noted by observation that there seem to be more Yale
                        than Harvard law graduates involved in politics and social policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Since Harvard turns out many good lawyers, there are plenty of
                    Harvard lawyers in government. Abe Chayes was a Harvard professor who became the
                    Legal Adviser of the State Department. But Yale focused on training people to be
                    active in the policy world. Perhaps, the focus was not on the international
                    policy world, and more on the domestic policy world, but the one went with the
                    other. And so I don't know what that did to the numbers in the end, but
                    certainly that was the emphasis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it at that point that there weren't many or any
                        women.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There were four women in my class of 102. They all graduated and all
                    went on to careers. But it was a male-dominated class. If you go to New Haven
                    now, the ratio is 50/50.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were going to Yale Law, what were you pointed
                        toward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was interested in an international career. I saw law as an
                    implement in the tool box of international affairs. But I faced several
                    problems. One of them was the requirement that, to apply for the Foreign
                    Service, one had to have been a citizen for ten years. I was naturalized in '53.
                    I wouldn't be eligible until '63. I was coming out of law school in '56. So that
                    presented a conundrum. It was solved to a very large extent by one individual
                    named Jack Tate. He had been Acting Legal Adviser at the State Department and
                    had a doctrine named after him. Jack was the Associate Dean in charge of
                    placement. He was a courteous and smart Southerner, a Virginian, who stood out
                    in the New England surroundings by his soft-spoken manner. He took an interest
                    in me. We talked several times. He got in touch with Loftus Becker, who was
                    Legal Adviser at the State Department. He urged me to apply for a position in
                    the Office of the Legal Adviser.</p>
                <p>That is what happened in the end, but there was a year in between graduating from
                    Yale Law and joining L. Not knowing where I would go, I still followed the
                    notion of doing more international law. I had opted for a year at Cambridge. In
                    the spring of my last year, I was all set to go to Cambridge, but it was sort of
                    an iffy track and I don't think my dad was too enthusiastic about it. But then,
                    all of a sudden, Myres McDougal, for whom I had worked and whose courses I had
                    taken, said, “There is a fellowship at Columbia,” where there was another great
                    figure in international law, Philip Jessup, who later became the American judge
                    on the International Court of Justice and who was a product of Columbia Law
                    School. Would I be interested? I said, “Yes,” because at Cambridge I had no name
                    that I could attach myself to, but at Columbia I could study with Jessup. Within
                    a week, I had a cable to the effect that I had been granted the fellowship. I
                    don't think I ever really applied. Mac must have arranged it. Basically,
                    Columbia offered me $2000 and the ability to spend a year there and get a
                    master's degree. They had a program which made it possible to do law and a
                    master's degree. Their sequence was two years law, one year master's, and the
                    last year of law. But in my case, the sequence was reversed, since I already had
                    my law degree. So I was offered this money which basically covered my tuition
                    and a chance to be with Professor Jessup. So that's what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: '56 to '57.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me about Philip Jessup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Phil Jessup was a tall, lanky gentleman, a very approachable sort of
                    a person. He carried no aura of importance around him. He was a seemingly
                    ordinary man with a dignified manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of the
                    subject. Gradually, I became aware that he was a man who had played important
                    roles with respect to some key policy issues, such as the lifting of the Berlin
                    blockade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Berlin airlift rings a bell. I may be wrong on
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I think you and I are reaching for the same thing, but I cannot be
                    precise about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was used as a troubleshooter by some presidents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: You are right. He had at one time been Deputy Permanent
                    Representative to the United Nations. He wore Uncle Sam's robes in that job.
                    Phil had a direct role. He knew the UN system well. At the time that he and I
                    crossed paths, he was back in academia. This was before he became a judge in The
                    Hague. At Columbia, he presided over a marvelous seminar that met once a week.
                    About two years later, he had me back to talk to postgraduate students about the
                    law of the sea. I had been working on this subject in the Department and in
                    Geneva. He kept track of his students and what they did, and gave me the
                    opportunity to come back and share my experience. I did go and see him in The
                    Hague once or twice later on. He always had time to see me. He and Mrs. Jessup
                    were wonderful hosts, very simple, and genuine. No folderol. I deeply respected
                    Phil Jessup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His son, Peter, has done a long oral history for us with
                        Sam Lewis, who was in Israel for a long time. Peter worked for him. He was a
                        station chief in Tel Aviv.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I remember meeting Peter once at the French Embassy and telling him I
                    knew his dad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, had you solidified your international
                        credentials? Was the Jessup seminar international?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes, it was international law. I forget exactly what he had us do. We
                    must have used some textbooks. But much of our contributions was based on case
                    materials. I don't have any papers that I wrote for him at the time, but that
                    course was the crown of my time at Columbia, which in other respects I did not
                    particularly enjoy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of international law at this time? When
                        I was at Williams, our class was to do a problem and the idea was
                        international relations, to do some research on international law regarding
                        overflight. All we could find were references to balloons. In other words,
                        it wasn't a very well- developed set of legal principles for some modern
                        things. This must have been an evolving thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I should go back for a minute to Harvard and Yale law schools. When I
                    came out of Yale college, I was admitted to both. My choice to remain at Yale
                    had to do with the fact that I could get this job as a freshman counselor. That
                    gave me free lodgings and some money, which I wouldn't have had at Harvard. That
                    made the decision for me. Quite a few of my Yale classmates went on to Harvard
                    Law and survived. As to your question, maybe international law was being formed
                    on the fringes of technology. I saw that directly a few years later when I was
                    in the Office of the Legal Adviser and my boss, Leonard Meeker, sat down one hot
                    summer day at his desk and wrote out in pen on a yellow pad the first draft of
                    what is now the Outer Space Treaty. That was law being made. My first experience
                    in making treaty law was the first year and a half in the Office of the Legal
                    Adviser when I did nothing but law of the sea. I spent three months in Geneva at
                    the first Law of the Sea Conference, which turned a lot of customary into
                    conventional law. That was an example of codification. But even at the time of
                    Jessup and McDougal you could fill a bookshelf with the established and accepted
                    international law in the world. For one thing, all treaties are international
                    law. The Department of State was publishing Treaties in Force, and also the U.S.
                    Treaty Series. These took a lot of shelf space. Going back to the Barbary
                    pirates, there was established law having to do with admiralty. The Geneva
                    conventions governing the laws of war were in force. There was an immense body
                    of practice that had become generally accepted by the civilized world as binding
                    law. Much of that was codified subsequently. An example is human rights law. I
                    had a hand in New York in that process. I say a hand, because I served in the
                    Third Committee of the UN General Assembly for six years. We were drafting the
                    Conventions on Political and Economic Rights. This was lawmaking. So, you're
                    right; the turning of customary into conventional law has been going on. I was
                    fortunate to be around when this was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick up your role in this later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You got out of Columbia in '57. Then what?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: By that time, Mr. Becker had decided that he would take me on as an
                    Attorney-Adviser, GS-7. In August 1957, I started in the Office of the Legal
                    Adviser.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it constituted at that time? What was the
                        atmosphere when you went in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It took me a while to find out because, within 24 hours after my
                    arrival and reporting for duty, I was detailed to work for a gentleman by the
                    name of William Sanders, a Foreign Service officer with long experience in Latin
                    America, who later became Deputy Secretary General of the OAS. He had the job of
                    special assistant to the Under Secretary of State to prepare for the first Law
                    of the Sea Conference. Bill Sanders needed an assistant.</p>
                <p>We were orchestrating the preparation of a large number of position and of
                    background papers for a conference in which a special UN conference would codify
                    customary law in a number of areas - the Law of the High Seas, the Law of
                    Fisheries, the Law of the Continental Shelf, the Law of Landlocked Countries,
                    and the Law of the Territorial Sea. This enterprise encompassed the whole body
                    of customary rules that were not in treaty form. The objective was to put them
                    into treaty form. The International Law Commission had worked for years on
                    drafts to do this and the conference was going to use these drafts as a basic
                    working document and turn that into five conventions. Given the scope of this
                    enterprise, it involved a lot of different parts of the government. It involved
                    Agriculture because of the fisheries element, the Defense Department because of
                    territorial sea, the Coast Guard, the Department of Commerce, State - and, in
                    particular, the lawyers in all of them - but it also involved political
                    constituencies in towns and states that depended on fishing. These were highly
                    political issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All one has to do is look at Peru and Ecuador and Nova
                        Scotia. We've been having fishing problems with Canada since time immemorial
                        or at least in '76. But I can see that you immediately have two groups that
                        would be watching with eagle eyes. One is the Navy, the right of free
                        passage and free miles. That was the holy writ as far as they were
                        concerned. And the fishing industry, which wanted to get as much as they
                        could wherever they could get it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. And our big issue was with the Canadians, mostly on the East

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware that you were going into such a political
                        minefield?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Not right away. You asked me what was the atmosphere. I can't
                    describe the atmosphere of thOffice of the Legal Adviser because I wasn't
                    located there. I was in an office with Bill Sanders. We were located in quonset
                    huts at the foot of the Washington Memorial. It was August. It was hot. My
                    periscope on the world could not have been narrower, because I knew nothing
                    about Washington and here I sat in an office opposite Bill Sanders and his
                    secretary. All I was fed was paperwork having to do with these preparations. I
                    had no idea how the Office of the Legal Adviser was operating. I had no idea how
                    the rest of the government was operating. Only gradually through the paper and
                    as we got closer to the conference, going to meetings, I acquired some sense of
                    what was happening in town. There were several contemporaries of mine in the
                    Office of the Legal Adviser, who were also involved in the preparation of
                    position papers and who attended the conference. One was Frank Boas, who left
                    later on to become a prominent attorney in Brussels. Another was Ben Read, who
                    later became a Deputy Under Secretary of State for Management. Both of them were
                    fine fellows and we became friends. Another was Bernie Hines. I don't know what
                    happened to him. There were Ernest Kerley, Warren Hewitt, and Alan Neidle. I got
                    to know them gradually. Physically, I was separated. Eventually, Bill Sanders
                    and I moved out of these quonset huts to a building that was just north of
                    Virginia Avenue, on the eastern side of 23rd Street. I think that building is
                    still there. The visa office was located there. We got two rooms on the first
                    floor. So we were a little closer to Old State. This made it easier for Bill to
                    interface with the many individuals in Main State who were also involved. All of
                    this was taking place between August '57, to the time the conference began, in
                    late spring of '58. Thus, we labored nine months in the vineyards and we ended
                    up with a humongous set of briefing books and background papers that would cover
                    this entire table. All these had to be cleared throughout the government. That
                    was the underpinning that we took with us to Geneva. This procedure wasn't
                    different from the preparation for any conference. Background papers and
                    position papers had to be drafted, cleared, and approved. The volume was
                    staggering. But by the time I went to Geneva, I really hadn't spent any time in
                    L.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, did you have a significant other? Were you
                        married?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Not then. I was not married. That didn't happen until 1964.
                    Washington was full of young people. There was a very active social life in
                    Washington, probably like today, although I'm not aware of it today the way I
                    was then. There were wonderful opportunities for young people like myself. There
                    was the Bachelors and Spinsters, a dance that was organized by some Washington
                    hostesses at the Sulgrave Club. There was also a series called the Dancing
                    Class, a white tie affair. Mrs. Thoron was one of the sponsors. That was not for
                    bachelors and spinsters, but rather for the nomenklatura of Washington. The
                    recipe was to have at least twice as many men as women, and to invite the
                    well-known couples, and then make sure there was a lively stable of young men so
                    that the women could dance all the time. If you were somehow deemed acceptable
                    to the hostesses, you had three occasions in the winter to put on white tie and
                    go to the Dancing Class. It was great fun. Chip Bohlen was there. He preferred
                    the bar to dancing. I danced with the wife of the Chief Justice. It was great
                    for us youngsters. Many of the people whom you read about in the press were
                    there. The habit was to move into the dancing crowd and just cut in. That's what
                    you were supposed to do if you were living up to the expectations of the
                    hostesses. Apart from these specific events, there was a tradition of
                    entertainment by many young people in Georgetown. Many were new to the Foreign
                    Service. Some were military. Some were young foreign diplomats. It was just a
                    constant life of parties. It was easy to make new contacts. All this made
                    Washington an enjoyable place. There were free concerts. But Washington was very
                    different then from now. There were virtually no good restaurants. There was no
                    Kennedy Center, only the National Theater. It was, as Kennedy once said, a
                    southern town and a little sleepy town. But for us it was lively enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy also described Washington of having attributes of
                        southern efficiency with northern charm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It wasn't that efficient. I don't remember how Washington was run in
                    those days. Charm? Yes. It was a very open town. For a stranger catapulted out
                    of New England schools, it was totally open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was a great gene pool, too. The mating went on
                        there. These were bright young people meeting bright young people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Before you went to the Law of the Sea Conference, did you get a feel of the
                    political pressures that were coming in on you?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I became very much aware of the more than academic interest of the
                    Departments of Agriculture and Commerce in fisheries. It was driven home to me
                    that the Navy and DOD were totally committed to the three-mile limit. At the
                    same time, before setting out for Geneva, we felt a sense of invincibility about
                    the exercise. We expected that, when we got there, our views would carry the
                    day. We would be by far the largest, one of the best led (Arthur Dean of
                    Sullivan and Cromwell was head of the delegation), best supported, best prepared
                    delegations ever. We, of course, knew from the International Law Commission what
                    was in the drafts that we were going to be working on. So we already sort of
                    knew the direction of the outcome. It was just a matter of making that
                    transition from a draft to a UN convention. It wasn't until Geneva that, on the
                    issue of territorial sea, we found out that we couldn't necessarily have our
                    way. Indeed, we failed to get our way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Law of the Sea Conference in Geneva. How
                        long did that last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Several months, a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arriving on this thing and carrying someone's portfolio
                        behind them, what was the atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: First of all, my role changed. In Washington I had worked for Bill
                    Sanders, who became the deputy head of the delegation. But the minute we got
                    converted to a delegation, we had to split up according to the committees of the
                    conference, which would be dealing with, respectively, the law of the
                    territorial sea, the law of the high seas, fisheries, the continental shelf, and
                    landlocked countries. I was allocated to the continental shelf Fourth Committee.
                    My new boss in that function was Marjorie Whiteman, the assistant legal adviser
                    for Latin American affairs, herself a Yale Law graduate and one of the earliest
                    women to graduate from Yale Law School. She was an experienced, studious lady
                    with a razor sharp mind, an incisive tongue, and a solid reputation in the ARA
                    bureau. She was extremely knowledgeable about maritime matters and the
                    continental shelf. So, those of us who made up the U.S. delegation to that
                    particular committee were Marjorie and myself, a naval officer, another person
                    from Commerce, and a representative of Interior. So five of us basically did the
                    continental shelf. After the conference opened, it quickly broke down into
                    committees and then labored through the draft convention on the continental
                    shelf, article by article until, two months later, the completed draft came back
                    for approval in plenary. So, my perspective of the conference at that point was
                    not as central as it had been with Bill Sanders, but far more operational
                    because we were actually negotiating a text.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the continental shelf meant and
                        what the issues were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: As to the continental shelf, the issue was what was below it. Oil was
                    key. But there were also minerals, like manganese, that could be mined. The
                    interesting thing was that the technology in those days did not really permit
                    the extraction of natural resources much beyond about 200 meters. In the end,
                    that became the definition of the continental shelf. The first thing the
                    committee did was to address issues of continental shelf boundaries as part of
                    offshore land, part of the mainland. Where did the continental shelf begin? It
                    begins at the water's edge. But how far does it extend and become the deep
                    seabed? Where were the dividing lines? There were a whole lot of proposals. But
                    in the end, the definition that was adopted was 600 feet or beyond that where
                    exploration and exploitation were feasible. This was an indefinite definition,
                    but it was good enough and it was the only one that got majority vote. All other
                    proposed definitions failed to get a majority. So logically this looks like an
                    odd outcome but politically it was the only possible outcome. By the time, some
                    years later, when there was another Law of the Sea conference, technology had
                    overtaken our definition and the definition was amended. You can now exploit at
                    huge depths. Thus, the old definition of 1958 is only of historical interest.
                    But that was one big issue, and it turned out to be the key issue. The committee
                    also discussed the nature of the rights on the continental shelf, and the
                    consequences of ownership or at least proprietary rights with respect to the
                    subsoil and seabed of the continental shelf. But it was the definition of the
                    shelf that took the most time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any major concerns on this that may have run
                        into opposition from other groups? What was in it for the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That's a good question. I'd have to go back to the record to give you
                    a solid answer. I would say that oil was never far from our minds, although at
                    the time I don't recall that we had industry oil people with us. We did have
                    officials from the Department of the Interior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I think we had been drilling in the sea by this
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes, we had. And so had others. For that matter, there were a number
                    of countries that were of the same mind as we were, not because they had their
                    own companies who were extracting but because they were lending concessions to
                    western oil concerns and wanted to have that pattern continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing eye-to-eye... Did we have our own group
                        that was pushing for the same thing? Were there other groups that were
                        pushing for something else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There was a sharp divide between the western maritime countries that
                    wanted freedom of passage, freedom of the seas, and a narrow territorial sea on
                    the one hand, and on the other hand, the Soviet bloc countries that,
                    interestingly at that time, wanted a broader territorial sea. They saw the
                    issues more as land mass countries. Today, they wouldn't. But then they did.
                    Canada explicitly wanted a wider territorial sea. The Canadian view was that
                    that would help protect them and their fisheries. That was a big thorn in our
                    side because Canada was part of the west, and they opposed us on this issue.
                    Britain, France, and the West Europeans were all with us. I don't think China
                    played a major role. But we ran into considerable opposition in Latin America.
                    The Soviet bloc commanded a cluster of votes, as did Latin America. There
                    weren't that many African countries at the time. So, in the end the biggest
                    fight was about the three-mile limit. In the end, the lobbying extended into
                    capitals, via Washington. President Eisenhower was involved directly with India
                    and with Canada. He spoke to their leaders. The choice was three or six miles.
                    In the end, predictably, thIndians went for a larger territorial sea. The
                    Canadians, unpredictably, went against us, too. We lost by one vote. So, we did
                    not get a definition of the territorial sea at that time and we didn't get a
                    convention on the territorial sea. The other conventions did receive a majority
                    support, were voted out, and eventually signed and ratified. In 1960, there was
                    another conference to deal with that territorial sea issue. That time the
                    Canadians were with us but India wasn't. We lost again by one vote. By then, I
                    was no longer involved. A different set of officials were. But it was rough
                    going. Washington was deeply disappointed. It had invested political capital at
                    the highest level. The paradox was that Arthur Dean, the head of our delegation,
                    was facing a Mr. George Drew, the Canadian negotiator. Drew was Canadian High
                    Commissioner in London. He got ill and was hospitalized in Geneva. As behooves
                    civilian behavior, Dean and Loftus Becker went to pay a sickbed call on George
                    Drew. I'm sure they didn't talk about his illness and the weather. Drew still
                    voted against us.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>At the end of the conference, the draft conventions prepared by the committees
                    had to go through a vetting process called the Drafting Committee. The task of
                    this committee was to homogenize the text of these various draft treaties and do
                    the basic housecleaning you do prepublication. However, some of these texts
                    carried enough substantive meaning below the surface of the words that it became
                    important just how the language was formulated. At that point, the conference
                    was running toward its conclusion and the territorial sea issue was still in
                    heavy dispute. It wholly occupied Arthur Dean. Thus, Marjorie Whiteman was
                    deputized to represent the U.S. in the plenary session and deal with the draft
                    conventions as they were coming out of the various committees. Through some
                    quirk of fate, I was designated to be the U.S. representative on the Drafting
                    Committee. There, I found myself sitting with Andre Gros, the legal adviser of
                    the French foreign ministry, Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, the legal adviser of the
                    British Foreign Office, of the United Kingdom, and Ali Bhutto Khan, who was then
                    the foreign minister, later prime minister, of Pakistan. I had been told by Dean
                    that he was extremely keen on one particular word change. So here I was, toward
                    9:00 p.m., a GS-7 surrounded by the greats of the international legal world. In
                    such August company, I would have remained silent. But I had my orders. So, when
                    it came to that particular paragraph, I did some lobbying. I got out of my seat,
                    tapped various people whose votes I needed on the shoulder, and said that I was
                    going to propose a change and would like their support. Ali Bhutto said to me,
                    “I don't know what it means, but I'll vote for you.” I got the change, and
                    Arthur Dean was pleased. (Bhutto was later hanged and his daughter became prime
                    minister.) That was my first experience of lobbying. I did a lot later on, in
                    New York. And it was my first example of a politico saying “Yes” for political
                    reasons, having little to do with the merits of the case, which is what my whole
                    training had been all about. (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I also recall from that evening a friendly remark by the Soviet legal adviser, a
                    venerable gentleman seated to my left by name of Boris Krylov. He turned to me
                    and said, “Mon jeune homme, moi je parle francais pas comme it est parle a Paris
                    mais comme il etait parle a St. Petersbourg dans ma jeunesse.” (”Young man, I
                    speak French not the way they speak it in Paris but the way they used to speak
                    it in St. Petersbourg when I was a young man.”) He was a holdover from the old
                    czarist regime and had somehow survived in this legal capacity. It was a
                    reminder that there was another hidden face of a Russia long ago.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The ratification and entry into force of the conventions that were
                    adopted made them conventional law. They had been customary law already, so
                    there was no great change in practice. And there was no change in practice when
                    it came to the territorial sea. The U.S. Navy continued to regard three miles as
                    the law. When a coastal state challenged that, the U.S. Navy basically pointed
                    its nose at them. In other words, we could say, “We thought we could send
                    submarines in as close as three miles and not have to ask for permission.” In
                    any event, we had the right of innocent passage, so practice didn't really
                    change. But after the conference, there was growing uncertainty about what was
                    “legal” and what wasn't. The United States Navy is doing okay today even with 12
                    miles because its capacities have changed. So that issue today is less important
                    to the Navy.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is February 6, 2003. You wanted to add a couple of things.</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The point I wanted to make in retrospect about the significance to me
                    of the Law of the Sea Conference was that, miraculously, it took only a period
                    of four years between my first course in international law with McDougal and
                    spending months in the company of the very top people in the profession. The key
                    legal officials of all members of the UN were in Geneva. The group included
                    Constantin Havropoulos, the Legal Adviser of the UN. I mentioned Sir Reginald
                    Manningham Buller, the titular head of the British delegation. He was a hulk of
                    a man. In Plenary, it was his custom to close his eyes and nap after lunch. His
                    assistant, Joyce Gutteridge, would pass notes to Marjorie Whiteman. One said:
                    “My delegate is asleep. What should I do?” Marjorie passed back a note (through
                    me, as I was positioned between Joyce and Marjorie): “Applaud.” The real head of
                    the UK delegation was the legal adviser of the British foreign office, Sir
                    Gerald Fitzmaurice. Our delegation had Loftus Becker, the Legal Adviser of the
                    State Department. Andre Gros was the Legal Adviser of the French Foreign
                    Ministry. So I had the privilege of being part of an exercise at top level and
                    watching these prominent international lawyers trying to make international law
                    in a political setting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way the Law of the Sea allowed top minds to work on
                        it compared to some other things which are sort of intractable, land-based
                        things. You could try to bring some order out of the sea, couldn't you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I wouldn't make too much distinction between land and sea. They all
                    had their problems. Thus, we had fishery problems with Canada, Chile, and Peru.
                    We faced continental shelf problems in terms of the exploitation of the
                    resources of the subsoil. There were problems with landlocked countries. We
                    tried to tackle the issue of the width of the territorial sea. The Law of the
                    Sea presented as much of a challenge as the problems on land. But the process of
                    codification of customary law was reaching its culmination and I just happened
                    to arrive to see it become treaty law.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958 at the end of this conference, what happened to

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I went back to Washington. For the first time, I found myself in the
                    Office of the Legal Adviser which hired me a year earlier. I was assigned to the
                    Assistant Legal Adviser foUnited Nations Affairs. That was a great assignment. I
                    couldn't have realized it at the time. My boss was a wonderful man named Leonard
                    Meeker. He later became Legal Adviser and subsequently ambassador to Romania.
                    Meeker was a Harvard College and Law graduate and a man of consummate patience
                    and great intellectual imagination and probity. I remember once, in a hot
                    Washington summer in the building on 23rd Street where we were located, Leonard
                    Meeker getting out a yellow pad and starting to write the first draft of the
                    Outer Space Treaty. The function of my new office was basically to provide legal
                    advice to the International Organizations Bureau, but also to be operational
                    with them. We were supposed to know the charters, constitutions, and procedures
                    of the organization to which the U.S. was a party. Our role ranged from that of
                    advisers on procedure to drafting and reporting. I found myself on the road much
                    of the time, going from one conference to the next, or backstopping the effort
                    in the Department to produce instructions for American delegations, principally
                    in the Security Council. This provided me my first opportunity to work closely
                    with Foreign Service officers. They were part of the so-called UNP Office of the
                    IO Bureau. Joe Sisco headed that office. Bill Buffum was his deputy. Then there
                    were others, such as Bob Oakley and Mike Newlin. They were a fine bunch. They
                    were savvy. Over my five years working with them, I gradually became like them.
                    Sometimes I even worked right out of their offices, particularly when we were in
                    a crisis mode, such as with emergency sessions of the UN Security Council. Those
                    connections, acquaintances, and friendships have lasted a long time.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Given my assignment, the main issue at the General Assembly of the UN
                    in New York was the drafting of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
                    later the Covenant on Economic Rights. This UN effort began with the UN
                    Declaration on Human Rights. Mrs. Roosevelt's name was closely associated with
                    its creation. Our job was to turn that declaration, which was a statement of
                    policy, into treaty text. That job had been taken on by the General Assembly of
                    the United Nations and was assigned to the Third Committee. The Third was also
                    known as the Ladies Committee because it dealt with all the social issues on the
                    UN agenda and delegations often assigned their women delegates to the Third. So
                    I found myself at first helping to put together, and clear through the
                    Department, the instructions to our delegation in New York. But then I also went
                    to New York as part of the delegation in 1958 and five more times in my course
                    of service in L. That gave me another and a very different taste of conference
                    life than Geneva had been. The General Assembly was not so much an atmosphere of
                    lawyers. It was an atmosphere of politicians and policy issues. Initially, my
                    role was to be the legal adviser to the U.S. delegation on the Third and the
                    Fourth Committees. The Fourth Committee handled trusteeship and
                    Non-Self-Governing territories. There were still quite a few in existence at the
                    time. They were all heading toward independence. Many of them presented both
                    political and legal issues so that a lawyer on the delegation was a useful thing
                    to have. Over time, however, it was the lawyers - and in my case it was through
                    my work in the Third Committee - I got so wrapped up in this work and had such
                    continuity that, when after two years the assignments for New York came out, not
                    only was I part of the delegation but I became the Executive officer for the
                    Third Committee. In that role I was basically the team leader, or chief of staff
                    for the U.S. delegation on the Third Committee. Being the team leader did not
                    mean that I was the U.S. representative. Under the UN rules, each delegation was
                    entitled to five representatives and five alternates. Often these alternates
                    were taken from all phases of political and corporate life. Earl Cocke, then
                    with Delta Airlines, was on the delegation. It was also a way for Washington and
                    the administration to make their bow to various racial groups. You had Jewish
                    persons of standing who were on the delegation, or blacks. They were the
                    figureheads and they got their committee assignments like the rest of us. Then
                    basically we, the staff, were added to them and we had to operate together to
                    carry out the U.S. agenda in the Committees.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The political person whom I found myself with upon arrival in '58 was Mrs.
                    Roosevelt's successor on the Human Rights Commission, Mary Lord. Mary was a
                    Pillsbury from Minneapolis. She was married to Charles Lord, a New Englander
                    with a Yale pedigree. Their son, Winston, later had a major career in the
                    Foreign Service. Mary was not only the U.S. delegate on the Third Committee but
                    also the U.S. Representative on the Human Rights Commission, another body of the
                    UN. I worked closely with her and with two or three staffers and had a wonderful
                    relationship with her. With the change in administration to the Kennedy years, I
                    found myself assigned with another person, namely Marietta Tree. She was from
                    New York and had been a strong supporter oKennedy. She was particularly fond of
                    Adlai Stevenson. When Stevenson became the U.S. Permanent Representative to the
                    UN, Marietta became the U.S. Representative on the Human Rights Commission and
                    also the Third Committee. So I worked for those years for Mary Lord and for
                    Marietta Tree in the UN. When the Human Rights Commission met in the spring,
                    alternately in New York and Geneva, I would go along and function basically as
                    their number two.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the delegation. Let's start with
                        Mary Lord. What was Mrs. Lord's outlook? And also the delegation, what were
                        we particularly interested in and how did it go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Mary Lord was part of a Republican delegation headed by Henry Cabot
                    Lodge. They were the Rockefeller Republicans. The Lodges had a strong sense of
                    patriotism. I saw that later, when I was in Geneva and John Davis Lodge was
                    ambassador in Bern. The Lodges believed in a sense of duty to their country.
                    They believed in the UN and in international organizations. They knew they had
                    the country behind them. U.S. public opinion regarded the UN highly. The
                    delegation was large. It included James Wadsworth, who later succeeded Lodge.
                    Jim Barco, a Washington lawyer, was the Deputy U.S. Representative on the
                    Security Council. The political section was fantastic. It was headed by Chuck
                    Cook, and included Frank Mewshaw, Chauncey Parker, Peter Thatcher, and Tom
                    Bartlett. Most of them were not Foreign Service officers. Some of them were
                    probably intelligence officers. Others were there because of personal
                    connections to the Lodges, the Lords, or some of the other political figures.
                    Max Finger, a Foreign Service officer, was doing economic work. He was
                    backstopped by an equally interesting crew in Washington, including Department
                    of State officials Walter Kotschnik and Kathleen Bell. I came to see all of them
                    as a very large family. Kotschnik and Bell were familiar figures in the Economic
                    and Social Council. I was part of the human rights group. There was also a group
                    of competent legal officers whose work centered on the Legal Committee. It
                    included Herbert Reis and, later, Bob Rosenstock. And then there were clusters
                    of officers who handled political issues in the First and Special Political
                    Committees. The whole backdrop was very political. I personally experienced that
                    when it was my turn one morning to do a brief presentation at a delegation
                    meeting on the work of the Third Committee. I spoke very highly of Mrs.
                    Roosevelt, not paying attention to the fact that Mrs. Roosevelt was a Democrat
                    and thaI was addressing Henry Cabot Lodge, who was a Republican. When we broke,
                    Mrs. Lord had another appointment and could not go immediately to take the U.S.
                    seat in the Third Committee, so I was in that seat. While the meeting was under
                    way, somebody tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Ambassador Lodge wants to see
                    you.” Lodge, as a Vice President of the General Assembly, had an office in the
                    Secretariat building. That's where I went. The view of the East River was great.
                    Lodge took me to task for having spoken the way I had about Eleanor Roosevelt,
                    neglecting President Eisenhower. He asked where I had gone to school. When I
                    told him Yale, it didn't improve matters because he, of course, went to Harvard
                    College and Harvard Law School. But then, as a sort of deus ex machina, a yacht
                    came into sight on the East River way below us; the conversation took a turn
                    toward sailing; and we discovered our common interest. I never became close to
                    Lodge, but he gave us a lovely wedding present when a few years later I was
                    married.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Third Committee was known on the side as

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was known as the Ladies Committee and it was dominated by social
                    issues, which in many countries were traditionally handled by ministers for
                    social affairs. Many of them were women. With the example of Mrs. Roosevelt,
                    human rights were regarded as in good hands with her and her successors. We
                    worked on things like the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. One of the
                    perennial items on the agenda was the Report of the High Commissioner for
                    Refugees. We had maybe 10-12 items each fall on the agenda. But the largest
                    chunk of time went into the drafting of the Covenants on political and economic
                    rights. That gave the ladies the chance to show their potential skills. And they
                    were as good as the best of their male colleagues.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was and it was a male-dominated United Nations. If you looked at

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That would be one way of putting it correctly. We saw our role
                    concretizing something which we assumed had already been universally accepted,
                    namely, the rights spelled out in the Declaration of Human Rights. It was our
                    job, with our skills and experience and background, to try and make that
                    relevant and useful for other countries as well. We had major problems. We also
                    enjoyed some successes. One of the successes was that this was a time when a lot
                    of African countries became independent. They were all writing their
                    constitutions. Many of them adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                    lock, stock, and barrel into their constitution, and adopted these highly as
                    their standard. That was the plus. The minus was that when we got to the fine
                    print, on issues of freedom of the press or individual rights, Bill of Rights
                    type of things, the representatives of many countries were extremely
                    uncomfortable with some of these notions. Representatives from the Soviet bloc
                    countries, for example, were not exactly looking for legal commitments to human
                    liberty, while their governments practiced state oppression. The issue of the
                    balance of human freedom versus collective authority was the focus of many
                    speeches and many votes - change a word here, or delete a paragraph there. The
                    paradox was personified by a perennial Saudi delegate named Jamil Baroody. He
                    was a permanent fixture at the UN. It was said that he had a particular
                    responsibility for the King to look after some of the King's sons. Baroody would
                    go around, making interminable speeches, basically being a difficult gadfly. We
                    knew perfectly well that the last thing he was interested in was to advance the
                    cause of human rights. His country had little practice and less standing in this
                    respect. Another delegate was Minerva Bernardino of the Dominican Republic. The
                    man who put her there was her close friend, Trujillo. So the Third Committee
                    presented an interesting mix of people and interests. But the trend, the future,
                    was clearly the way Mrs. Roosevelt had seen it originally. Working it out was
                    the hard slogging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was talking to Sally Cowal, who much later worked in the
                        UN under Jeanne Kirkpatrick. She was saying that the United Nations is very
                        much like Congress, that votes were traded. Each country had its own
                        particular issues it wanted votes for. These votes would be sort of traded.
                        Did you find yourself involved in watching the political process going
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We saw plenty of that. I experienced the practice in an ever more
                    acute form later, when I was back at the UN in a different capacity. To get a
                    resolution through, you needed cosponsors. And you traded. New Zealand might
                    have something. You might have something. And the result was I'll cosponsor you;
                    you cosponsor me. It was a live type of diplomacy. You were out of your seat all
                    the time. As the debate went on, it was normal to cruise around the Committee
                    room to lobby. The loudspeakers were on, so you could hear what was going on
                    regardless of where in the room you were. But we were constantly marketing
                    texts, checking other people's texts, suggesting changes, and then when it got
                    close to voting time, counting votes. You wanted to know how you were going to
                    do before the vote. I don't recall that we did that on every vote for every
                    article of the Covenants on political rights. But we were constantly horse
                    trading. That was part of the process. You got to know your colleagues well,
                    since you were negotiating on a whole range of issues for a period of three
                    months. You knew that you would have to live with these colleagues on a
                    different issue the next day. That created a political fabric. It served
                    everybody.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Eisenhower administration, how strongly were they
                        committed to the cause of human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I had little insight in the level of commitment of the White House.
                    Most of the instructions for the USUN delegation, as it related to the Third
                    Committee, were either written in my office in L/UNA or cleared by L/UNA. We
                    were familiar with our marching orders: To complete the Covenants. That's what
                    we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mrs. Tree? What was her background? Didn't she
                        come from a theatrical family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: She came from a clergy family. Her father had been an Episcopal
                    bishop of Massachusetts and a Groton graduate. His name was Endicott. Marietta
                    was different from Mary Lord, but they shared the same traits of openness and
                    enthusiasm. They were also easy to work with. Marietta was well off. She had a
                    townhouse on 79th Street. Her husband, Ronnie Tree, was mostly in Barbados. So
                    she was often by herself in their 79th Street townhouse, which she shared with
                    her two daughters, Frankie and Penelope. She entertained a great deal. I was
                    often her opposite man at the many black tie dinner parties that she used to
                    give. They were done in the traditional style. After dinner, the ladies would go
                    upstairs. On one occasion, when the Russian representative in the Third
                    Committee, Madame Miranova, a Russian deputy minister, headed for the library
                    after dinner with the men and sat down, Marietta stood on the staircase and
                    beckoned to me, “Get her up here.” I went to Miranova and said, “Madame
                    Miranova, Mrs. Tree would like you to go upstairs,” pointing. She smiled.
                    Marietta was impatient and gave me another signal, turned her back, and
                    disappeared with the other ladies. I was left with the job of getting La
                    Miranova upstairs, so I went back to her and I repeated my request. She looked
                    at me, smiled, and said, “But I like it with the men.” That was the end of that.
                    She stayed in the library amidst men, brandy, and cigars. On another occasion, a
                    sit-down dinner, black tie, an African representative arrived with two wives. I
                    reported this to Marietta in a flustered state. She coolly said, “Set another
                    place.” And that was it. She was very generous. She had many contacts and never
                    hesitated to share them. One time Andrew Heiskell of “Time” magazine and she had
                    a lunch at some fancy restaurant in midtown. He wanted to know something about
                    the UN. She took me along. So here I was, in the Rolls Royce, going to lunch
                    with Marietta and Andrew Heiskell, who was a big name in New York. She didn't
                    mind having an assistant along, becausI might help deal with any difficult
                    questions. In Geneva she was equally generous, sharing what she knew about
                    people and having fun, doing what we asked her to do, coming up with her own
                    ideas. In a sense, Marietta was more of a little girl than Mary Lord. Mary Lord
                    knew what she wanted. She had been in the job long before I joined her. She had
                    a huge stable of friends from all over the world. My presence didn't really make
                    much of a difference. Mary Lord also knew exactly what she wanted to do. The
                    fact that we were around helped her; she would ask us to draft her speeches. But
                    she also trusted us. She would go to the hairdressers and we would just move up
                    to sit in the delegates' seat. She was perfectly happy to let us do that. Once,
                    Committee proceedings went faster than expected. The issue was freedom of the
                    press. It was the U.S. turn to speak, but Mary was still not there. So I
                    delivered the remarks. This was the one and only time that I made “Time” and
                    “Newsweek” all in the same week because the press was very interested in what
                    the United States representative said in the Third Committee on that subject.
                    Mary never conveyed any sense that I trumped her, or that we should have warned
                    her, or brought her back, or anything like that. It was all perfectly okay. She
                    was absolutely comfortable in her own skin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know the difference between the support that Cabot
                        Lodge was giving to your work and that of Adlai Stevenson? Was there a
                        difference in style or tone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Considerable. I don't think Henry CaboLodge ever came to the Third
                    Committee. He left it to Mary Lord and the staff. Adlai, however, was
                    interested, and would show up on occasion. I recall his remarks when Mrs.
                    Roosevelt died and he gave the eulogy. That took place not in the Third
                    Committee, but in Plenary. Adlai was interested in human rights. Also, the
                    relationship between Adlai and Marietta Tree was close. It was Marietta who was
                    with him when he died in Grosvenor Square. Marietta arranged for me to come
                    along once to a Georgetown dinner for Adlai by Polly Fritchey. Then we went to
                    Constitution Hall for the Human Rights Day celebratioAdlai cared a lot about
                    that. But Adlai had other concerns. His principal job was in the Security
                    Council, dealing with the major political issues of the day. He biggest one
                    during his tenure was the Cuban Missile Crisis. I felt closer to Stevenson than
                    to Lodge. But I think that sense on my part is due to the fact that when I
                    worked with Lodge I was a newcomer. When I had the chance to work with Adlai, I
                    knew the ropes. The General Assembly once extended into January and February. I
                    went back to New York as the delegation's legal adviser. In that capacity I
                    wrote a speech for him that he gave without changing a word. This gave me a
                    sense of loyalty to him that I never had with Ambassador Lodge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Western European delegations. Were
                        you all singing out of the same hymnbook? I always think of the French
                        taking exception to things. How did you find support from our traditional
                        allies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I have a narrow answer to your broad question. My perspective was
                    from within the confines of the Human Rights Commission and the Third Committee.
                    We worked well with the French. At one time France was represented in the
                    Commission by a Nobel Prize winner, Rene Cassin, a famous man and a
                    distinguished French professor. However, the Quai d'Orsay staff that supported
                    him was mostly second rank. When Cassin was in the room, the Commission listened
                    attentively. When his deputies were there, they didn't make that much of a
                    difference. They were not rivals to us. They cooperated. The Western caucus was
                    a pretty comfortable brotherhood. One steady ally and friend was the British
                    representative, Sir Samel Hoare. In Geneva, he joined some of us on a ski trip
                    to Saas Fee. He wasn't a great skier, and slid down the Kanenenrohr on the seat
                    of his pants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any delegations that we kind of followed? Did
                        you feel that we were out ahead or were others real team players?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Persons got to prominent positions in the UN system not by being
                    wallflowers. The UN family was a collection of varied and strong personalities.
                    People stood out. Once in my early days, the British representative was Sir
                    Pierson Dixon, and the Indian representative was Krishna Menon. I watched the
                    delegates' lounge when Menon gave Sir Pierson Dixon a tap on the shoulder, but
                    in this case he did this with a cane that he always carried. The tap of the cane
                    hit Sir Pierson on both shoulder blades. He always stood up straight but he
                    stood up even straighter when he got hit that way. So we were witnesses to a lot
                    of personal idiosyncracies. We kept a distant eye on the Soviet delegation. We
                    did not work very well with them. We could count on solid opposition at almost
                    every turn in our continuing human rights discussion. Those were the days when
                    the Soviets used their veto in the Security Council, and the Security Council
                    was lamed. There were talented individual Soviets, to be sure, and they could
                    speak very well. But we were never close to them the way we were years later,
                    when I was doing arms control in Geneva and we were cooperating with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There you were both after the same thing in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the Third Nonaligned Movement got
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It existed, but it was not until years later that we saw the excesses
                    of voting blocs, including the nonaligned voting bloc. The Yugoslavs in my days
                    did not play the role that they played later on. There were regional and other
                    caucuses, but at the time I don't think we were talking about blocs. Each
                    country could and did reach out to its own regional constituency. In the Third
                    Committee I dealt with Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico as much as I did with the
                    Europeans, although, for a variety of reasons - in my case not being able to
                    speak Spanish - I probably spent more time with the Europeans. Remember that the
                    UN in those days consisted of only some 80 members. It is now double that
                    number. It was a manageable UN. It was a UN in which the United States was the
                    principal western member and where the United States mostly could get its way.
                    The excesses came later, with the Zionism equals racism resolution, and things
                    of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were backed up by Joseph Sisco, quite a name in
                        bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Joe was a slam-bang operator of the best sort. Irrepressible,
                    energetic, vivacious, tough. In some of his expressions he could be pretty
                    crude. I will not put some of those remarks on the record here. He was a
                    fabulous bureaucratic operator. He understood politics. When I first knew him he
                    was the Director of the office of UN political affairs at State. He was
                    powerful. We used his name to refer to a certain style of reporting: Make sure
                    you record what Sisco said; what the diplomat on the other side said was of
                    secondary importance.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the system work in the Third Committee trying out famous ethnic people
                    or famous people for being famous? A lot of the glitterati would come out as
                    delegates. How did this work?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: For a while the Belgians had an author as their representative in the
                    Third Committee. His pen name was Marnix Gijsen. He wrote in Flemish and in
                    French. He was a thoughtful man. He carried out his instructions with elegance,
                    but kept a relatively low profile. Belgium did not have a major role. I started
                    to read his works and found he was a marvelous author. It was fun to know the
                    man that was writing the books that I was reading. He once gave me a little
                    inscription on the front page of a short story. The inscription said, “I notice
                    that you've read this.” The short story was entitled “Liever heimwee den
                    Holland,” which meant “Rather homesick than Holland.” I still pick up his
                    writings to enjoy his exquisite use of the Flemish language.</p>
                <p>Another one was the Dutch representative who was a Franciscan priest. His name
                    was Father Beaufort. He had signed the charter for the Netherlands in San
                    Francisco. Whenever he invited you for lunch in the delegates' dining room, he
                    ritually went through the entire wine list, but all of us knew in advance that,

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Belgium. Were we doing anything of leaning
                        on the Belgians as the Congo got ready to be independent? What were we doing
                        on this tremendous surge of independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The man who was trying to manage the transition of the Congo was Paul
                    Henri Spaak of BelgiuI have a picture of Spaak in the Fourth Committee with
                    Adlai sitting in the American seat. We weren't leaning on the Belgians
                    particularly hard. Congo was not at that point yet a major issue for the U.S.
                    administration, although it became so somewhat later. I recall that my colleague
                    in the Office of the Legal Adviser, Alan Ford, who was doing African Affairs,
                    and Mac Godley, who was an office director in AF, ran U.S. Congo policy when the
                    country was coming apart and we had to deal with Lumumba. The Belgians also had
                    to deal with the push from a lot of the underdeveloped countries who wanted the
                    Congo to become independent and who saw this as another desirable step in the
                    process of decolonization. But I don't think that we were at that time leaning
                    on the Belgians. The process was already well under way. My view of that issue,
                    however, was limited at that time.</p>

                        the U.S., this whole period of the very late '50s and early '60s regarding
                        Africa was “This is going to be a very exciting place. These countries are
                        going to become independent. All sorts of wonderful things are going to
                        happen.” What was the feeling on your part and the delegates'?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It started to happen at the beginning of the '60s. The Kennedy
                    administration in particular had to deal with it, through the person of Soapie
                    Williams, who was Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. We saw as inevitable
                    the evolution toward independence of what had been dependent territories. We
                    knew that they would eventually be joining the United Nations. We understood
                    that in some cases a bad transition might leave the people in these countries
                    worse off. But there was simply no stopping the political impetus on that
                    continent and indeed throughout the world. We ourselves had a record of
                    supporting decolonization. We leaned on the Dutch with respect to Indonesia, and
                    later New Guinea. We approved of the British transfer of authority to India and
                    Pakistan. Our druthers as a country were that this was a process that not only
                    was happening, but was a good thing, since it would bring more democracy. This
                    was consistent with the American view of how the world should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the arrival of delegates from these newly independent
                        countries change the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: Over time, yes. The flood of new countries changed the UN simply
                    because it added to the numbers. It also added to the complexity of multilateral
                    diplomacy. It led from caucuses to blocs. It led to fairly rigid procedures for
                    dividing up positions. For instance, the recent election of Libya as chairman of
                    the UN Human Rights Commission is a direct result of a system that had its
                    origin in UN enlargement. A growing membership of the UN also drove the larger
                    countries to create caucuses and smaller groups. The last time I was on the
                    delegation was '95. I bet that now, eight years later, I would have to learn
                    again what the new alignments are. You have to know this terrain if you're going
                    to be effective in this multilateral world.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Before we go on, I should mention that I had an interlude of almost a
                    year in L when I was the special assistant of the legal adviser, Eric Hager. I
                    don't remember much about that period except that Mr. Hager was a very nice
                    person. He unfortunately died very early after leaving that job. He came out of
                    a large New York firm, Shearman and Sterling. He was a lawyer's lawyer. He did
                    not believe in lawyers taking political positions or playing political roles. He
                    was interested in the cases we had before the international court. He argued
                    some of them himself. He wanted L to take a fairly restrained approach to the
                    business of legal advising. This was in contrast to later legal advisers like
                    Abe Chayes, who wanted L to be involved in policy. This is an eternal conundrum
                    that every lawyer has to solve for himself. There is no right answer or wrong
                    answer. But there are two very different styles and Eric Hager was the lawyer's
                    lawyer style.</p>
                <p>One day I was asked by Dick Kearney, a longtime German hand who eventually became
                    Deputy Legal Adviser, whether I would be interested in going to Berlin. There
                    was a position that L staffed. It was that of legal adviser to thU.S. Mission in
                    Berlin. The U.S. Mission was basically the equivalent of what the British and
                    the French still called military government. We didn't call it that, but it was.
                    We had occupation rights in Berlin. In fact, they lasted right until the
                    unification of Germany. And we exercised these rightThat accounted for the
                    requirement of a lawyer. So Dick's question was, would I wish to go there? When
                    I indicated interest, I also had to be vetted by Elwood Williams of the Office
                    of German Affairs. Elwood was in a wheelchair because of a medical disability.
                    He had been a Foreign Service officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think multiple sclerosis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: He was confined and could not have a Foreign Service career. But he
                    was a permanent and key presence in GER. No one went to Germany or Austria
                    unless you were personally approved by Elwood. Never mind Personnel or the
                    Director General. It was Elwood's decision. He interviewed me and asked whether,
                    given my experience in occupied Netherlands, I thought I could do this job.
                    After some thought, I told him I thought I could. That assignment was the start
                    of an involvement with the German question, which eventually became a major
                    theme of my career. As I look back, I have had longer experience with Germany
                    than with any other country or issue, going back to the day that Nazi forces
                    invaded The Netherlands on May 10, 1940. I remember this day very well. I still
                    follow German affairs closely and I still know a lot of Germans. And Germany has
                    changed totally during this period of my involvement. I have made a sea change
                    myself in my views of that country and its people, from a hostile view about
                    Germany and Germans to the view that I hold now. Today I am a strong supporter
                    of the democratic and free Federal Republic of Germany that we have today and
                    the democracy that Germany practices.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The political situation was that everybody still vividly remembered
                    the recent blockade and the airlift, and also the visit of President
                    Kennedy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: Everybody remembered the “Ich bin ein Berliner” phrase spoken by
                    Kennedy at the Rathaus. Two-thirds of Berlin was under western allied
                    administration and the remaining one-third under Soviet administration. The
                    western part was surrounded by the wall, not just dividing the city, but around
                    the whole city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the wall was a new phenomenon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. It had gone up in '61. But it extended entirely around West
                    Berlin. We were sitting in the middle of a large number of well-trained and
                    equipped Soviet divisions, 100 miles from Helmstedt and the border with West
                    Germany; we were exposed. Even though there was an American, French, and British
                    military presence in Berlin, the total allied garrison was less than 10,000. Our
                    part of it was probably 6,000. We had four battalions and a tank unit. We were
                    basically there as hostages. But you could also look at us as guarantors of
                    Berlin's freedom. That's how the Berliners saw us. The threat was a Soviet
                    threat. The East Germans were a nuisance factor. It could be considerable. It
                    was not a threat to us. But the Soviets were. The city was cut off from western
                    Germany. Berliners could not get in or out except with permission. They could
                    fly in and out on one of the allied airlines. With a lot of hassle some of them
                    could go on the ground. But it meant submission to all sorts of controls. So for
                    all practical purposes, most Berliners were trapped in the town. The saying at
                    the time was that one out of every third Berliner was a widow over 65. Berlin
                    continued to exist because of heavy financial support by Bonn. So Bonn paid for
                    Berlin and the allies defended it. That was how Berlin lived.</p>
                <p>In a strategic sense, Berlin was the crucible of the Cold War. It was the point
                    where the Soviets exercised pressure. They had done it with the blockade. They
                    did it on more than one occasion later on. I went through several mini
                    blockades. Within months after my arrival, an American military column was
                    denied entry into Berlin at Babelsberg. The U.S. Army Berlin command sent a
                    support column out. The Soviets permitted it to go through but we held the
                    column in place. I have aerial photographs, taken by an Army helicopter, of
                    these two allied columns, and of Soviet APCs blocking the way. Meanwhile, the
                    U.S. command and the rest of us were down in a bunker. We were in direct contact
                    with the White House. A Berlin crisis in those days meant potential war.
                    Everybody was conscious of that. That's probably one of the reasons it never
                    happened. But you could never be sure. The Soviets had imposed the notorious
                    Berlin blockade. Something like that could happen again. You really felt that
                    you were in the eye of the storm. It created strong bonds of kinship among the
                    officers who were assigned to the U.S. Mission. That is particularly true for
                    the State personnel who were my colleagues. When you have an external enemy you
                    depend on each other. And we had the interesting challenge of administering an
                    occupied city. We ran the American sector. The French and British ran theirs.
                    Obviously, we weren't staffing every administrative position with allied
                    personnel. In that sense the city was really run by Germans. But it ran under
                    allied authority. So the public safety officer, a mid-level Foreign Service
                    officer, directed the police in the U.S. sector. The Senator for Justice was
                    subject to my direction. It was an exotic situation, but it worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to somebody who was in Berlin in '61 when the
                        Kennedy administration came in. They were very nervous because people on the
                        Kennedy staff were talking about, “Well, maybe we can work something out
                        here” and the feeling was they might give away more than was justified
                        trying to make a deal with this. But I think their spine got stiffened after
                        a while. Did you pick up any of that initial concern about the Kennedy

                    that, the President squarely put himself behind the freedom of the city. Every
                    Berliner understood it that way. The whole world had heard it. The issue of
                    unconditional American support for the city was settled in as black and white as
                    you can settle anything. For any of us to have done anything to undercut this
                    understanding would have affected our strategic position in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what I gather, the legal side of things was extremely
                        important because you had the Soviets trying to change the rules and get us
                        to give away a little here. How far do you let down the back of your truck?
                        All sorts of things. All of this was based on a legal code or at least a
                        code of practice. It was almost a theology.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: These issues were my day-to-day bread and butter. It wasn't just
                    tailgates. Every procedure had been worked out and agreed, either tacitly or
                    through accepted custom. The Quadripartite Agreements of 1944 provided the basic
                    legal framework. They were embellished later on by other agreements. When the
                    Soviets took East Berlin out of the Quadripartite administration machinery run
                    by the Kommandatura, the Kommandatura remained as just a western operation. But
                    everything - crossing into East Berlin and letting the Russian soldiers into
                    West Berlin, the process of running the military trains, the procedures for road
                    access through Helmstedt, the administration of air access through the air
                    corridors, the operation of Spandau prison - was governed by an intricate system
                    of habits that had solidified into accepted practice. Any change, no matter how
                    small, always raised the question “What is the other side up to?”</p>
                <p>

                        this your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: My responsibility ran in a different direction from that of my
                    political colleagues. One of them dealt full time with the group of issues
                    relating to the air corridors. They were our lifeline. There were notification
                    procedures for each flight. Permission would be granted for each flight, but
                    with conditions. One had to do with the altitude at which we could fly. These
                    flights were bumpy because we couldn't go over 10,000 feet. The weather in
                    northern Germany below 10,000 feet is often lousy, with much wind and no
                    visibility. The Soviets wouldn't guarantee flight safety above 10,000 feet.
                    Another political officer handled Autobahn access issues and military train
                    issues. My role had to do with the fact that we were in authority, and that
                    anything that the Berlin authorities did had to have our imprimatur. This
                    involved several activities. First of all, in the most routine way, the
                    Berliners liked to think of themselves as part of the Federal Republic. That was
                    not part of the allied legal way of thinking. To us Berlin was occupied
                    territory, and whatever transpired in the Federal Republic did not apply to
                    Berlin. Thus, Berliners wanted legislation identical to what as valid in the
                    Federal Republic. What they would do, and what we allowed them to do, was to
                    adopt by a Berlin law verbatim whatever the federal law was. But before that
                    could go into effect in Berlin the allies had to give their approval by formal
                    letter or order. The legal advisers of three western missions exercised that
                    authority. We reviewed every piece of legislation of the Berlin House of
                    Representatives that was taking over federal legislation. And when we did not
                    like parts of that, we excluded those parts from application in Berlin. For
                    instance, we allowed Berlin to take over only a small part of the federal air
                    traffic law, because only the allies had air traffic rights in Berlin, and the
                    Germans had none. We were not about to let them have any authority in an area
                    that touched security. So Berliners could not fly helicopters in Berlin, nor
                    fixed wing aircraft. That would have been too dicey anyway. The allied lawyers
                    had staffs that went over proposed legislation, each in our own missions. I had
                    two German lawyers working for me. But I was the person who would then caucus
                    with my two allied colleagues, and we would agree on the text of a Berlin
                    Kommandatura letter or a Berlin Kommandatura order that would approve or
                    disapprove the adoption of legislation equivalent to the federal legislation. In
                    addition, the allies could and did issue their own legislation, Berlin
                    Kommandatura Orders or BKOs, thus exercising legislative authority. I also had
                    to sign off on every request by the Berlin judiciary to handle any case
                    involving allied property or personnel. That was about 30 a day. I would sign my
                    name that often every working day, giving the Senator of Justice permission for
                    the German authorities to proceed or not. So the lawyers administered a whole
                    routine administration. I worked very closely with two British and two French
                    legal colleagues in the course of my four years. Going through an intensive
                    process like that made us close. There was another role that legal advisers in
                    each mission had, although I can't speak for the British and French. This was
                    the role of advising the minister, who was the top State Department officer, and
                    the Commandant as to the limits of their authority in the U.S. sector. On
                    occasion, I had to remind them that the Constitution applied, that there were
                    certain things that they could not do, such as taking people into custody
                    without representation, or closing off areas, or exercising allied authority on
                    the Reichsbahn railway tracks in the U.S. sector. That was a dicey role. Here I
                    was, an FSR-4, equivalent to lieutenant colonel, and I was basically telling
                    two-star superiors that they could not legally take action they wanted to take
                    for political reasons. To exercise the function of legal advice initially
                    required an enormous amount of work to understand in detail the entire allied
                    legal structure and content. It required a fair amount of political judgment as
                    to what laws to apply and not. The French, British, and U.S. legal activities
                    had a large degree of autonomy. I cannot recall any case where the minister or
                    the commandant overrode me on a major matter on which I had given advice.</p>

                        was going to start, it was going to start there. Who were the ministers,
                        American civilians, and the commandants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The top U.S. representative in Berlin was George McGhee. He was the
                    ambassador in the Federal Republic of Germany. He resided in Bonn, though there
                    was a residence for his use in Berlin. You remember, John McCloy went out with
                    the title of High Commissioner, not as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Frankfurt and we had the HICOG building
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Precisely. I remember the building. The second in command in Berlin
                    was a U.S. major general. In my time there were two - Major General James Polk
                    and Major General Franklin. Each sector had its general. Third in line was the
                    deputy commandant, who was also the resident top diplomat. That was the minister
                    in each sector. In my time, the post was held by Arch Calhoun and Brewster
                    Morris. I don't remember all the names of the French and British sides, but I do
                    recall the British commandant, Major General Peel Yates, who was always
                    accompanied by his cocker spaniel. Some of the generals would tend to read into
                    politics a lot. Others stuck to military matters. There were different styles in
                    which the three sectors were run. The French maintained by far the most reserved
                    and hostile attitude toward the Germans. We probably were at the other end of
                    the spectrum. The British were somewhere in between, but the British took no
                    nonsense from the Germans. We had a slot in the political section occupied by an
                    officer whose job it was to do the liaison at the Rathaus, where the elected
                    representatives of Berlin were located, and which was headquarters of the mayor,
                    Willy Brandt. In my time, the slot was filled, first, by Lucian Heichler and
                    then, by Brandon Grove. That is how we interfaced with the German political
                    process in Berlin. When I came to Berlin in '63, the sense of allied dominance
                    was still pervasive. In our minds, we still lived in the wake of the world war.
                    We were there because we defeated the Germans and occupied Berlin. In my role
                    that was the kernel of the situation. We had occupation rights. They were pretty
                    absolute. But 20 years later, the balance had swung and we were no longer
                    exercising those rights the way we had before. We were letting the Germans do
                    far more than we did in the early '60s or in the late '50s. But when I was there
                    in the '60s I was, unlike Lucian and Brandon, who were part of the vanguard of
                    officers who were already learning to do the political interface with the German
                    democratic process.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Just recently I became aware of the fact that, in the classified part of his
                    efficiency report, which the rated officer could not see at the time, a
                    colleague of mine, who was the labor officer in Berlin and who therefore had to
                    deal with the labor unions, found that his supervisor had put in there as a
                    criticism that he had too much contact with the Germans. In retrospect, this was
                    an astonishing comment to make. But this is illustrative of the fact that the
                    mindset in the U.S. Mission was that you had to keep your reserve with the
                    Germans and keep them in check. When I returned to Germany 15 years later, this
                    attitude had wholly changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the mayor when you arrived in '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was Willy Brandt, who was even then already well known, though he
                    had not yet made an international mark in terms of his efforts to reach across
                    the line that divided Germany and to build bridges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ostpolitik.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Brandt started a process of what was called “Passierscheine.” He
                    worked out with the East German authorities a process whereby West Berlin
                    citizens could make Christmas visits across the wall. My memory is not good on
                    the details. We didn't recognize the East German authorities in East Berlin and
                    stuck to the theory that the Soviets were responsible for their Sector. So if
                    anything happened to us or our personnel in East Berlin, we would talk only to
                    the Soviets. We would cross Checkpoint Charlie and refuse to show our documents
                    to East German guards. We kept the windows of our cars up. Eventually, we would
                    just open the passport and show the East Germans the title page, but we would
                    not hand them any document. We would absolutely refuse to have them touch our
                    documents or put any markings in it. Of course, they tried very hard to do so
                    because that would then be represented as constituting legitimization of their
                    regime. Our view was that the Soviets were responsible for the Soviet Sector of
                    Berlin, just as we were responsible for our part of it.</p>
                <p>We could go to East Berlin under the Quadripartite Agreements and we were never
                    denied access to do so. We had to run this gauntlet of administrative obstacles
                    and basically keep a stiff upper lip and stick to our procedures. Every time the
                    East Germans did something to us, a complaint would go to the Soviets.
                    Conversely, the Soviets had the right to come into West Berlin and they did so.
                    They drove their vehicles and their soldiers around West Berlin. Of course, they
                    had to come to West Berlin because of their role at Spandau, which was in the
                    British Sector. Spandau is another story because that was another one of my
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about it. What was Spandau and who was there? What
                        were our problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Spandau was a huge prison complex built in the mid nineteenth century
                    that housed three prisoners: Speer, von Schirach, and Hess. It was one of the
                    two remaining Quadripartite operations after the Soviets walked out of the
                    Kommandatura. One was the allied air control system. The other was the prison.
                    There were four governors of the prison. They ran the place, each with their set
                    of wardens who pulled duty the way wardens do in a prison. The exterior guard
                    was mounted each month by allied and Russian troops in a determined succession.
                    The U.S. always had December. We always took it from the Russians, who had it
                    iNovember. We handed it over to the British, who always had it in January. They
                    had to devote pretty much of a company of soldiers to man all the watchtowers
                    and the exterior guard. They basically stood guard. In a way there wasn't much
                    to do about these prisoners because there was a certain routine. But on occasion
                    there were issues. One was when von Schirach developed eye problems and needed
                    surgery which could not be performed in the prison. So he had to be taken out of
                    prison. That required Moscow's approval, which eventually was forthcoming. There
                    were repeated allied attempts, in my days and subsequently, by the allies to
                    close the place and let Hess out after the other two were released. That always
                    ran into a Soviet roadblock. But the whole business of running that prison and
                    agreeing on the regime had plenty of administrative angles that did require the
                    attention of the U.S. prison governor, who was a lieutenant colonel and who
                    reported to me. My role was not to get involved in those details, but to be
                    aware of them. But I did get involved directly as the action officer whenever
                    something unusual had to happen, like taking von Schirach out, or when the time
                    came to release the other two and leaving Hess in there. It was a midnight
                    operation. It was sort of eerie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that? Why was it done in that
                        manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, the expiration of the sentence was at midnight. I believe on
                    September 30, 1966. It became a major press event. Spandau prison was in the
                    British sector, so the British had the chore of maintaining the law and order
                    there. They kept tight control. The Soviets refused to let the two prisoners out
                    a minute earlier. But there was the whole issue of how do you let these men walk
                    out? Hand them their stuff back, put them in transportation, and get them out of
                    Berlin. When Hess was there, his uniform and other artifacts were kept in the
                    prison. There was also still an old guillotine in the prison, from the Nazi
                    days. There was always the risk that wardens or somebody would make off with
                    stuff in the prison and sell it as souvenirs. In my time, I dealt with two U.S.
                    prison directors there, Lieutenant Colonel Blake and another lieutenant colonel
                    who later sold his story for publication, against the rules. The Army never went
                    after him for that. His name was Eugene Bird. It was on Gene Bird's watch, in
                    American month, that Hess committed suicide, something that should never have
                    been allowed to happen. There was always a risk that someone would make private
                    gain out of this very odd relic of the war. I would go into the prison every
                    American month to go along with the American doctor. We had that responsibility
                    for our month. I would not talk with the prisoners but I would know where they
                    were, see their condition, inspect their cell. I was never tempted to conduct
                    conversations with any of them. Hess was pretty much of a recluse and probably
                    wouldn't have talked anyway. Von Schirach was a cantankerous man. Speer, on the
                    other hand, was a nice person, but I didn't see it as my role to engage Speer in
                    historical discussion. He was a prisoner. My role was to see that the prison was
                    run right. There was an officers mess in the building next to the prison. The
                    directors, who met daily, ate there. Once a week, they would invite guests. I
                    think it was on Thursdays. I could always come out and have lunch. But it was
                    the prison director's prerogative and mine to invite guests to come out on
                    Thursdays. So in American months we would have chicken or steak. In Russian
                    months we would have the Russian food and in the French months the French would
                    come up with French food. It was all cooked by the same German cooks. It was not
                    haute cuisine but it was pretty different from month to month. It was also the
                    only place where allied personnel could meet with live Russians in Berlin.
                    Outside of Berlin, on the other side of the Glienecke Bridge in Karlshorst, was
                    located the headquarters of a Group Soviet Forces in Germany. The allied
                    military missions had their headquarters there. That was the other place where
                    we had a military interface with the Russians. We had contact also at the air
                    control center, but this was basically an air controller operation. But there
                    was always the possibility that someone could use Spandau as a place to have a
                    political discussion with the Soviets. Typically, they would bring out uniformed
                    folks from Karlshorst. On occasion there would be a civilian and then the puzzle
                    was, who is he, why is he here, what does he want? Most of the time guests would
                    just come out and meet 20 or so people at lunch and for some quadripartite
                    conviviality in a rather forced atmosphere. There was always plenty to drink on
                    those occasions. I guess nearly 10% of my time in my four Berlin years went into
                    the issues related to the administration of Spandau.</p>

                        What was the Soviet attitude and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Ours was very simple. We thought that a lifelong sentence for Hess
                    was no longer realistic given the way the world had moved. (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I have to guess at why the Soviets would never agree to release Hess. What they
                    said was that they suffered so many casualties during World War II at the hand
                    of the Germans that this type of action was simply out of the question. Moscow
                    stuck to this position right until the end. We tried to revive this issue from
                    time to time, but it never got anywhere. It was not going to be a major point on
                    any Soviet-western agenda such as it was in those days. If there was an agenda,
                    it had more important issues than that. No U.S. administration was going to
                    spend political capital on it. But it seemed the right thing to do, so there was
                    never any opposition in London, Paris, or Washington. We did not consult the
                    Germans in Bonn beforehand, though we kept them informed.. So they were aware of
                    what was going on. But the German government was not in a position to even
                    express an opinion about what the allies did with Hess.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I remember it vividly. The Berlin Bar Association had their annual
                    dinner. I was an honored guest. It was an idiosyncratic situation, because here
                    were all these senior lawyers, judges, magistrates, and prosecutors, and here I
                    was, the U.S. legal adviser half the age of most of them, but still in a way for
                    them the key person in the room. We had just started. There was music and it was
                    going to be a nice evening, although I have to say that even nice evenings in
                    Berlin in those days could be pretty dour and heavy. This was a town that was
                    still pockmarked by the war. A lot of destroyed buildings had not been
                    reconstructed. Berlin suffered from a fairly heavy climate, both physical
                    climate and a psychological climate. Levity was not part of the Berlin life in
                    those days at all. It was mostly serious stuff all around. But a good party
                    meant at least adequate food, although it was not by today's standards very
                    good, and plenty to drink if you wanted. Well, the news came. The music stopped.
                    The dinner did not take place. Then there was an eerie silence that night when
                    the candles appeared all through town. It was a horrible weekend - because then
                    there was Oswald and his assassination. It was a surreal thing. And then came
                    the burial, and it was just at Thanksgiving time. It was an awful period for
                    everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was on leave in Graz when it happened and I went rushing
                        back with my wife to Belgrade. It was the same. For a communist country, it

                <p>What were you getting about the atmosphere and the spirit of the people? A third
                    of them were widows over 65. This meant that young people were getting the hell
                    out, weren't they?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: They were, and businesses had left already. No major company had its
                    headquarters in Berlin. It was just too hard to get to Berlin and out. Moreover,
                    it wasn't all that safe to do so. So Berlin consisted of a lot of people who in
                    their business activities were appendages to things going on in the Federal
                    Republic. The Berlin official apparatus was totally dependent on financial
                    influx from the treasury in Bonn. It couldn't do anything for Berlin security.
                    Of course there was the police, but the police were under allied and not German
                    command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the spy-counterspy type thing in
                        Berlin? Did Berlin being a spy center play any role in what you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Only peripherally. Of course, there was a station and I knew some of
                    the officers. I was only vaguely acquainted with most of those folks. They kept
                    very much to themselves. But they were probably outnumbered by military
                    intelligence because the Army must have been there in huge force. Until the day
                    when we relinquished our wartime powers in Germany, this remained a problem.
                    There was a stable of Army contacts that existed alongside the Agency contacts.
                    This situation didn't always work synchronously or even in harmony. I became
                    particularly aware of this later, when we were engaged in efforts to secure the
                    release of some of these German citizens who had been working for the Army. Many
                    were just poor devils caught up in the web of intrigue that was not of their
                    making. But in those days, there was the Teufelsberg, the heap of rubble, on top
                    of which was a large electronic facility that could do a great many things. In
                    my work I didn't need intelligence. I went by my daily in-box of telegrams from
                    all the posts around us that were repeated to Berlin. I didn't need to know,
                    with occasional exceptions, if an individual case in which the Germans wanted
                    jurisdiction and U.S. authorities might not want to grant it. Then somebody
                    would come and talk to me. I also had to deal with the Berlin Judge Advocate on
                    some of those issues. But I don't remember any major incidents or set-tos and it
                    certainly was not part of my daily routing to get involved in intelligence,
                    somewhat unlike my later experience in Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There are two answers: hers and mine. Hers is that we met in
                    Washington. Mine is that we met in Rome. Both happened in the course of 1963. We
                    did go to the same party in Washington just before my departure. She was on her
                    way to Rome as vice consul. In December of '64, I had been in Berlin for a
                    little over a half year. I went to visit a Foreign Service colleague, Frazier
                    Draper, and his wife. He was an ambassador's staff aide in Rome. Their oldest
                    daughter, Sallie, was my godchild. My wife, Ruth, had a dinner arranged. Someone
                    dropped out and the Drapers said, “But we have an extra man at home. Can we
                    bring him?” So I was taken along to this small dinner party on the Piazza Navona
                    and met my wife there. Not quite a year later, we were married iNew York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work for her? Did she have to resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: She did. The rules were clear about that. Or I could resign, although
                    that was never really part of our discussion. She did resign. At that point she
                    was on her way to Laos. It was the summer of '64. She told me later that she had
                    looked into possibilities not just of working in Berlin but for me working
                    iLaos. But the fact of the matter is that she did resign. Later, just to run
                    that story out, the rules changed. Meanwhile, our children were born and it
                    became possible for people who had had to resign for reasons of marriage to
                    apply for reentry. In the '70s, when I was in The Hague, she sought that reentry
                    and was asked to take the oral exam again in Washington at her expense, which we
                    thought was somewhat unfair. But she was readmitted. It wasn't until my next
                    assignment in Bonn as Political Counselor that there was a position for her as
                    well, as head of the consular section of the embassy. From that time on, we
                    worked alongside and, later on, separately on occasion.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: For me, getting married was a big change. Rather than being a
                    bachelor in Berlin with a pretty intense job, having a wife facilitated and
                    broadened my existence, because most of my colleagues were also married and we
                    were very much part of each other's familiar. There were the Nagys and the
                    Gleysteens, the Days, the Polanskys, the Brogans, the Woessners, the Meehans,
                    and the Ryersons. We also had a few other bachelors: George Jaeger, Dick Smyser,
                    and Bill Allen. We were all a pretty close group.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Dirk Gleysteen and Oobi Gleysteen. Also Lucien and Muriel Heichler.
                    The strange thing is that even today this group of old Berlin hands is as tight
                    a clan as you can imagine, as we were at that time. We really got to know each
                    other. We were all under the same pressures. We all lived the same life. We were
                    dependent upon each other. Generally, the tougher the hardship post, the better
                    the friends you make. Berlin certainly made that true for us. Ruth came out to
                    join me. She did some teaching at the Kennedy School. Our first child was born
                    in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the ambassador was number one in your hierarchy.
                        Did the hand of Bonn, the legal adviser in Bonn, do much with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The legal adviser in Bonn was an exceptional man named Joachim von
                    Elbe. Joe, who of course was originally German, had come to the United States in
                    the '30s, obtained a graduate degree at Yale, and then went back with military
                    government after the war, and ended up as legal adviser to the embassy. He was a
                    courtly, learned, wise presence in Bonn, a man very much of the old school and
                    the opposite of a slam-bang operator. I was far more operational in Berlin than
                    he was in Bonn. He belonged to the generation of Bill Tyler. At the time that I
                    got to know him, he worked on strictly legal things, consulting and advising on
                    all sorts of issues. There were always plenty of them, because of the presence
                    of our forces in the Federal Republic and the fact that we still had the special
                    status in the Federal Republic. But he was not an operational part of the
                    political show in the embassy. While Joe could give me a lot of wisdom, he never
                    sought to give me direction. I welcomed his wisdom, but on operational things in
                    Berlin he could not. Because of the distance and the different milieu, he was
                    not in a position to be of much use to me. He later wrote a book in German with
                    the title translated “Under the Prussian Eagle and the American Stars and
                    Stripes.” I have an inscribed copy at home. It is a conventional but fascinating
                    account of his career as a German civil servant and later as an American civil
                    servant.</p>
                <p>Did Bonn sit on me in other ways? There were too many layers that insulated me. I
                    generally operated in a realm away from the political counselor in Bonn. The
                    higher level in Bonn was above my pay grade. My direct experience with
                    ambassadorial visits to Berlin was also limited. I was the control officer for
                    the Ambassador once or twice, but I don't think that I ever briefed Ambassador
                    McGhee or had much to do with him substantively. It was always a hassle handling
                    the McGhees. They were demanding visitors. It usually threw the front office in
                    a tizzy when they came. Of course, the ambassador had a residence in Berlin as
                    he had his residence in Bonn. But he didn't spend much time there.</p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Let me back up for one second. I mentioned earlier that I was a civil
                    servant in the Office of the Legal Adviser. I had a GS rank. When I went
                    tBerlin, I became a Foreign Service Reserve officer. The reason was that at the
                    time I entered the Department of State, I could not have become a Foreign
                    Service officer because under the law and regulations one needed to have been a
                    U.S. citizen for ten years. I had been naturalized in 1953. I came into
                    Washington in 1957. Direct entry into the Foreign Service was not an option for
                    me, so I didn't consider that. But by the time I got to Berlin as an FSR, it was
                    1963, and this restriction no longer existed in law. Knowing I didn't wish to go
                    back to L - or to law for that matter - I wanted to stick with the Foreign
                    Service. I applied for lateral entry into the Foreign Service officer corps. I
                    thought that being a Foreign Service Reserve officer would make that a little
                    easier. Indeed, during the last inspection we had in Berlin, the inspectors very
                    kindly picked up what had been an application that hadn't been moving forward.
                    When they went back to Washington, it did move forward and I was invited to take
                    the oral. This happened at Embassy Rome. It was conducted by a panel of three,
                    chaired by the then DCM in Rome, Frank Meloy, who as later assassinated in
                    Lebanon. It was a short trip to Rome. The interview was easy. The results were
                    positive. By the time I went to USNATO, I was an FSO. However, going to NATO
                    didn't happen in the normal assignment process either. In my time as a lawyer
                    for the IO bureau, the assistant secretary at the time was Harlan Cleveland.
                    Since I often attended the IO staff meetings, I had somehow come to his
                    attention. In 1967, Harlan was ambassador at NATO. The NATO organization had
                    just gone through the traumatic experience of having been kicked out of France,
                    which meant that the NATO military headquarters moved away from Fontainebleau to
                    Mons, in Belgium, and the NATO diplomatic establishment moved from Paris to
                    Brussels. In the course of that upheaval, the French action gave rise to a claim
                    for compensation to the other members of the alliance and to the organization
                    for the costs it had to incur in order to be able to make the move. Therefore,
                    there was a process that involved both a NATO claim against France and also a
                    bilateral U.S. claim since there were a lot oU.S. forces involved. Harlan
                    obviously was involved in that issue at a high level, and he needed a lawyer. He
                    knew me because I had performed for him before as a lawyer. So, he was
                    interested in having me join the delegation in Brussels in a legal capacity at
                    least for the purpose of handling such legal issues as would obviously have to
                    be dealt with by him and by the Council in connection with the claim. When I
                    arrived at NATO, Bill Cargo, the DCM, took me aside and asked me whether I knew
                    what Harlan intended to do with me. I had to tell him honestly I wasn't sure. It
                    transpired that the NATO organization had also obtained the services of a
                    lawyer, an American by the name of Peider Kunz, who was born and raised in a
                    little village in eastern Switzerland, but who was an American. I know that some
                    ambassadors on the Council wanted Harlan to assure them that he was not really a
                    CIA employee and I know we gave that assurance. So NATO as an organization had
                    this American lawyer and Harlan had me. In the event, I never did a great deal
                    of legal work. The issues were handled elsewhere and eventually settled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French ante up or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There was an anteing up. But there were complicated issues involving
                    such concepts as negative residual value. In other words, the French would
                    regain the use of an airstrip that had been used and maintained by American
                    forces. So the demand on our part for compensation for the lack of use of such
                    airstrip was met by a counterclaim for alleged French costs it would take to
                    convert that airstrip back into normal pasture land. I don't recall the sums
                    that eventually were involved, but some money did pass. But to a large degree,
                    these claims and counterclaims in the end offset each other.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: My initial assignment was civil emergency planning. NATO had a lot of
                    committees. Some of them were main committees. Civil Emergency Planning was one
                    of the main committees but it was outside of the mainstream of NATO work. But
                    civil emergency planning was a set of procedures that had been codified into an
                    entire body of existing structures and organizations that had to do with
                    anything from provisioning of energy in terms of crisis, to providing transport
                    in terms of crisis, to taking care of civilian populations, and calamities of
                    any sort. This big structure of committees was handled under the broad hat of a
                    Civil Emergency Planning Committee on which the representative from Washington,
                    who came from the Office of Civil Emergency Preparedness, filled the U.S. chair
                    at high-level meetings. During normal times that chair was taken by me, sitting
                    in for my ambassador. The ambassador could always take the American seat
                    whenever he wanted to. But there were at the time over 200 committees in NATO
                    and the ambassadors didn't do that. So I operated with a bunch of colleagues,
                    mostly at the second secretary level. Under the chairmanship of an Italian by
                    the name of Deveglia, who was a NATO civil servant, we did our civil emergency
                    planning work. I did this from a position in the political section, which was at
                    the time headed by Ray Garthoff, and later by Ed Streator. I spent a year and a
                    half learning something that was totally new to me but which did involve quite a
                    few committee meetings and a lot of negotiations. At one point, we took the
                    initiative - it was Ed Streator's idea - to organize a symposium. Basically, it
                    was an unstructured meeting at high level to kick a lot of these issues around.
                    I'll just give one more example of what civil emergency planning involved. Our
                    whole CRAF [Civil Reserve Air Fleet] alert system was part of a wider NATO
                    system that would have done the same thing for the civilian NATO aircraft in
                    other countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French were in and out of NATO. Were the French in
                        this particular area?</hi>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The French were in the Civil Emergency Planning Committee. The French
                    role was handled by a schoolmasterish but nice civil servant, not from the
                    ministry of foreign affairs, who had the advantage of having been there a long
                    time and the disadvantage of having been there a long time. He also sat on some
                    other committees. He fancied he knew English better than he did. One of my
                    colleagues from DOD, a civilian by the name oJoe Loveland, an enormous guy who
                    was himself married to a very tiny Frenchwoman, amused us one evening when Ruth
                    and I were at dinner at the Lovelands and our French civil servant colleague was
                    there. Joe would affectionately address him as “Old Fart,” a word which the
                    Frenchman didn't understand. He thought it was a compliment. Of course, it
                    caused us all sorts of problems in having to keep our faces straight during
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any disasters or things that you had to
                        mobilize for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: No, but it was all planning for what if. The planning was quite
                    advanced and the structure was a good one, and it still exists today. It
                    involved a whole pipeline system for petroleum in Europe because it would have
                    had to provide for the energy for the tanks and trucks of the armed forces. It
                    involved everything having to do with transportation and taking care of
                    civilians. It did interface with a lot of different parts of the Washington
                    bureaucracy. So it was quite bureaucratic. But it was important because this
                    would have had to function had it become necessary.</p>
                <p>I recall one other amusing thing. Occasionally, Washington would provide
                    political input not just in terms of direction but also in terms of people. At
                    one time I found myself having to deal with the then lieutenant governor of
                    Texas, Ben Barnes, who somehow came over as a senior representative on the
                    meeting of the Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Barnes was full of stories.
                    The one I remember is the description of his mother-in-law as a “bad, long ride
                    on a rainy road.” Barnes later got into ethical difficulties back in Texas. They
                    effectively curtailed his political career.</p>
                <p>Q: What role did the Germans play in this? I would imagine that they would be
                    right in the center of everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, yes, but so did the French, because the pipelines ran through
                    France and the fighting would be in Germany. In fact, Germany was important. I
                    don't particularly recall the German representative on the committee. But I do
                    recall vividly the British representative, Tony Morgan, who many years later
                    turned out to become the opposite number of my wife in Zurich where he was the
                    British consul general. I also remember the Norwegian, Kris Prebensen, who later
                    became head of administration in the NATO Secretariat, taking the place once
                    occupied by Lord Coleridge. And I remember Marino Deveglia, our chairman, who
                    had all the strengths and weaknesses of the caricature of an Italian. The
                    Germans would have been the beneficiary of a lot of the work of the Civil
                    Emergency Planning but not exclusively, since the assumption was that, if the
                    balloon went up, all of Europe would be affected and all European populations
                    would have to be looked after and that would have to be done by governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of this segment of the NATO

                        during an earlier period you had mentioned that at that time after the Cold
                        War the U N officials had to show results but during the Cold War it was
                        better to keep your head down and be a bureaucrat. How did you find the NATO
                        organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The NATO organization was impressive, not because of the building we
                    were in, which is the building they are still in, although there is a decision
                    now to construct something new. It was an advanced temporary building. It was
                    big, with a lot of wings off the main corridor at three levels. We occupied an
                    entire wing at all three levels on the western side. The U.S. delegation for the
                    Military Committee was right across the main corridor, on the other side.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The quality of the NATO staff, many of whom were seconded at senior levels from
                    the national services of the members, was pretty good. NATO was important and
                    countries saw to it that they sent good people to these jobs. So the various
                    assistant secretaries - general were usually top-notch people, as were those
                    working directly for them. I mentioned Lord Coleridge. I should also mention the
                    NATO Secretary General at the time, who was an Italian by the name of Manlio
                    Brosio, a diplomat of consummate skill whom I had a chance to observe a lot,
                    because my role as a notetaker behind Ambassador Cleveland meant that every
                    Wednesday I would be watching Brosio perform as chairman of the NATO Council. He
                    did that with enormous skill. He was an old-fashioned diplomat. No raised
                    voices. He knew his brief, he did his homework, and he managed wisely to sum up
                    every discussion, so that the creation of the so-called decision sheet, which
                    was in effect the decision of the meeting, would not be too difficult. I don't
                    recall his making any mistake, although I'm sure he made some. It was really
                    wonderful to see such a man in action, and to see the style with which he could
                    manage this very difficult job. Of course, the NATO ambassadors were all prima
                    donnas. They did, however, know their place. NATO never voted. In theory
                    everybody was equal. The reality, however, was that each ambassador knew roughly
                    what his country brought to the table and would tailor his role accordingly.
                    Iceland or Luxembourg, for instance, would not speak on many issues, or if they
                    did, would make their remarks very short. The major countries, on the other
                    hand, were quite different. Occasionally, you would have an exception, but the
                    discipline of the group - and it was quite a tight group; there were 15
                    ambassadors - usually had a salutary effect on any diplomats with tendencies to
                    be outside of the norm. There was the Dean, Andre DeStaercke, Belgian, a
                    bachelor and a man who never could get over the fact that he had to move from
                    Paris back to his hometown of Brussels because he had a wonderful apartment in
                    the Cinquieme in Paris from which later on he could watch from his windows the
                    student revolt in '68. But DeStaercke also played a role in dealing with this
                    issue of how the NATO Council should use Peider Kunz on the claims issues. I
                    remember accompanying Mr. Kunz to lunch once at DeStaercke's apartment. He was
                    an erudite man. Because he was Dean and because he represented the host country,
                    he could afford to take as much time as he wanted and no one in the Council
                    really ever cut him short.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How diHarlan Cleveland work within the Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: Cleveland, in my view, was a prince and was seen as such by his
                    colleagues. He was not a professional diplomat. He was seen as more than that,
                    as an intellectual of extraordinary imagination and drive, and a capacity of
                    turning ideas into concrete action. As a result, he commanded huge influence
                    with his colleagues, who listened very carefully to everything he had to say.
                    Working with Harlan did have occasional downsides, not because it wasn't
                    exciting - it certainly always was - but Harlan was so devoted to his job and so
                    cerebral about all the issues that it never mattered to him which day of the
                    week it was. I recall his calling a staff meeting once for 3:00 p.m. Sunday.
                    Tommy Wilson, his personal choice as political counselor and also a political
                    appointee, said to him, “Harlan, it's going to be Sunday” anHarlan in effect
                    said, “So what?” We did spend a lot of time in the office with Harlan. I mean
                    that literally. The hours at NATO were extremely long. We typically would find
                    ourselves on Saturday mornings saddled with instructions - I'm slightly ahead of
                    myself because this was not in Civil Emergency Planning, but on arms control
                    issues - which Washington would have managed to disgorge late Friday afternoon
                    and which would land in Brussels on our doorstep for execution Saturday morning.
                    Our job was then to turn the cable into an actionable paper and get it around.
                    Of course, we ran into the difficulty that about half of the delegations simply
                    didn't staff on Saturday mornings, which meant that we often had to get ahold of
                    their duty officers, or in some cases just slip the envelope under the door. I
                    think that today they probably have a similar problem because there are five
                    more countries and some of them are thinly staffed and they simply cannot afford
                    to be there all weekend. It was damned hard work. But it was hard work with
                    really terrific people. I have mentioned Garthoff, who was involved with
                    Ambassador Gerard Smith in the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) and then
                    START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) negotiations. I mentioned Ed Streator,
                    who was a powerhouse and also very inventive. Bill Cargo and later, George Vest,
                    were strong DCMs. Harlan had two right-hand men. One was Tommy Wilson, who was
                    the POLAD, a job later held in my time by Larry Eagleburger. Tommy came from the
                    outside. He was an author and a longtime friend of Harlan's. Tim Stanley was the
                    personal representative of the Secretary of Defense. That meant that Tim
                    basically commanded all the folks who were on the U.S. Mission staff from the
                    Pentagon, on the third floor. Tommy handled the political work. Bruno Luzatto,
                    another academic pal of Harlan's from World War II days in Italy, was the
                    economic counselor. It was a tremendously talented team of erudite and worldly
                    people who were quite comfortable in the very important roles that they had and
                    who, by and large, worked very well together, something that is not always the
                    case. There have been times at NATO when I've watched these relationships go
                    pretty sour, but in those days they worked really well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, I remember Secretary Rusk coming for one of the meetings at
                    ministerial level. In those days, we would always begin on a Thursday night with
                    a non-NATO issue, namely, the Berlin group, which was traditionally convened in
                    rotation by the bilateral embassies of the four members of the Berlin group in
                    Brussels. These ambassadors normally had to do only with Belgium, but when the
                    Berlin group met they had to throw a dinner which very often they did not attend
                    themselves. On that occasion when somebody asked Secretary Rusk the next morning
                    how the dinner had been - it had been at the German residence - he said, “Well,
                    they served rabbit and the rabbit is still running around in my stomach.” There
                    was, of course, always a tremendous bureaucratic run-up for these defense and
                    foreign ministers meetings because there was the natural drive that they should
                    produce some result. So there was always a premium on coming up with yet an
                    other idea. One of those ideas in the Cleveland days was the Committee on the
                    Challenges of Modern Society, also known as the CCMS, not really directly
                    related to NATO work, but Harlan made it so. The organization followed. We got a
                    new committee called CCMS. I think it's still there. So, by accretion, the
                    organization tended to grow as a result of this habit of periodic meetings.
                    Nothing was ever subtracted. There was the usual frenzy of briefing papers and
                    of course the exchanges with Washington to get all the ducks in a row. The
                    meetings themselves would be the typical high-level visit with all the hassles
                    that went with it. But it became so routine, and it is so routine today, that
                    the admin staff in Brussels, which is actually located mostly in the embassy
                    downtown, is completely at home dealing with those things. Things become
                    different when the President comes. Then the magnitude of the complexity
                    increases exponentially. But there's been plenty of experience with handling
                    presidents at NATO as well. It just makes for hard admin work. Over time
                    potential problems, like which ambassador gets to shake the President's hand
                    first at the airport, got sorted out. Once the pattern was settled, that was
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Not that I recall. There must have been some. I did have to handle an
                    emergency almost within a month after my arrival. It had nothing to do with
                    civil emergency planning but it had to do with the fact that I was duty officer.
                    It had to do with a potential outbreak of Greek-Turkish hostilities in November
                    1967. There was a very real possibility of war. On the evening of November 25,
                    1967, at Brussels airport, my job was to come up with 400 gallons of JP4 to fuel
                    an aircraft to get Secretary General Brosio into the theater as soon as
                    possible. The thought being that if he were there it would perhaps prevent war.
                    War didn't break out and his timely arrival may have had something to do with
                    it. Within 24 hours, Washington also provided Cyrus Vance to back up Brosio in
                    the Aegean theater. The rest is history. But I remember being at the airport,
                    not really knowing my way around, and knowing nothing about what JP4 looked like
                    or how much it cost. But I did get it and we got the plane off.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your observation of the Greek and Turkish
                        delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I draw a blank on that. In civil emergency planning they didn't
                    really count, although maybe they should have. They didn't attend all the time.
                    My other year and a half at NATO, I was taken off civil emergency planning and
                    was asked to do arms control work. So I had a very different life. Even in that
                    life I don't remember much about what was a virtually constant standoff. This
                    was long before Turkey occupied Northern Cyprus. Greece was coming out of the
                    colonels' period. Neither country had strong governments. Turkey was still
                    pretty far away in everybody's mind, and simply not regarded as part of Europe.
                    It was a NATO member, to be sure, and it was an important NATO member, but I'm
                    generalizing now. The specific answer to your question is that I had no direct
                    experience with either of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Soviets viewed by the NATO members? Were they
                        going to do something? Had we learned to live with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The Soviet Union was what NATO was all about. That was clear. By the
                    time I got there, it had already been four years since the assassination of
                    Kennedy and longer since his American University speech in which he held out the
                    prospect of a better relationship with Moscow. Consequently, the mood was
                    different from the mood that I recall from my time earlier at the General
                    Assembly, where the Russians were always vetoing, and there was really no common
                    ground that we had with them at all, and in Berlin. That is not to say that
                    anybody felt sanguine about the Soviet Union. It was the Soviet threat, the
                    threat of mass destruction, the threat of nuclear weapons, but also very much
                    the threat caused by the huge conventional preponderance of the Soviet forces
                    that absolutely riveted the attention of the NATO countries. Everything that was
                    done was related to that. During my time at NATO, there was an attempt to beef
                    up the individual military efforts of the NATO countries. It was the first of a
                    number of such American initiatives over time to increase national defense
                    budgets. The Mansfield Amendment was out there as a constant reminder that, if
                    the Europeans didn't pull up their socks, the Americans might not necessarily
                    stay. There was a lot of talk about burdensharing. At that time, NATO also was
                    addressing nuclear defense. But by the time I got to do arms control, the
                    doctrine of flexible response was in place. Member countries were becoming used
                    - or reconciled - to the new doctrine, and became gradually more comfortable
                    with the new NATO strategy. My occasional visits to SHAPE certainly reinforced
                    the impression that this was about balance of power, that this was about
                    readiness, that this was about a major political threat to the European
                    continent and to the United States because of the nature of the Soviet weapons.
                    There was a great feeling of solidarity within the Council, created not just by
                    the common enemy but also by being together in one building for long, long hours
                    on all these strategic and operational issues. Even though you might be hassling
                    about individual details, being together and going through the same grinder
                    produced very strong friendships. France was always a little bit on the
                    sidelines of these things, not because it viewed Moscow differently but because
                    the French were in an ambivalent situation. They were part of the political NATO
                    but not part of the military NATO. So they were not part of the Defense Planning
                    Committee but they sat on the Council. So they were either half in or half out.
                    But everybody else was fully aboard and lived with that situation. Neither
                    Harlan Cleveland nor his successor, Bob Ellsworth, worried overly about the
                    French. Another PremRep, Will Taft, did years later. He made it his mission to
                    see if he could really work with his French counterpart. But in the late
                    sixties, most delegations had absorbed the shock of the move from Paris to
                    Brussels.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of the French, during May-June of '68, there was a lot of unrest in
                    France, student revolt and all that. DeGaulle made a very famous visit to the
                    troops stationed in Germany. Did that have any repercussions within NATO?</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Not directly, although everybody in Brussels, certainly those who had
                    just moved from Paris, were fascinated by this popular explosion on the streets
                    of Paris that seemed to have taken its cue from Berkeley, but had domestic
                    roots. The French traditionally like to go to the streets whenever they feel
                    strongly about something. French society in those days was still sufficiently
                    inflexible so that the young people could feel that their only way out was to
                    hit the streets and build barricades in the old tradition. But it was also a
                    more basic challenge to the constitutional order of France at that time. Indeed
                    it was the harbinger of the end of the Fourth Republic and the coming of the
                    Fifth Republic. It made it easier for DeGaulle to institute the Fifth Republic.
                    But the event as such did not produce direct political effects on other
                    countries. There had already been in Berlin - and I had witnesses that in
                    1966-67 - a very vocal student presence around the Universitat. The students
                    liked to demonstrate and some of these demonstrations turned violent. In one
                    case after the visit of the Shah of Iran, a student by the name of Benny
                    Ohnesorg was killed during a demonstration. For about 24 hours, Berlin was on
                    the edge of serious instability. So, street riots were already a feature of
                    Europe at the time and '68 in Paris was not anything new. It certainly was not
                    an issue that the Council discussed in Brussels. But at NATO one could hardly
                    not be aware of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Vietnam a burr under our saddle while you were

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was one of these things that everybody knew about. Everybody had
                    views about it. And the governments of NATO had strong views about it. It was
                    not on the agenda. That is not to say that there was no discussion of Vietnam in
                    the Council. I'm pretty sure there was because the conflict went on a long time
                    and it was part of the established NATO meeting habit to have various committees
                    deal with various issues affecting almost anything in the world. So we had at
                    least yearly meetings of East European experts and of African experts and of
                    Near Eastern experts. These meetings would bring deputy assistant
                    secretary-level officials from capitals for a couple of days to talk together.
                    Southeast Asia experts must have had their go at it as well. After the meetings
                    of foreign ministers, there would have been a paragraph about Vietnam in it. But
                    it was not an action item for the NATO Council. There was simply no question
                    about NATO being involved. This was not in the NATO area and it was the other
                    side of the world. There was little point in dwelling too much on an issue that
                    was at the root of such disagreement, because it would be at the cost of
                    disagreeing on European issues. So that was not done.</p>

                    entered the building through muddy fields. When we left that day, Belgian
                    workmen had covered these areas with squares of grass.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Again I have to plead ignorance on that also, because of the sort of

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: You have to understand the delegation that Harlan and, later, Bob
                    Ellsworth presided over consisted of three floors of people, It became even
                    bigger later on. And then across the main corridor, there was a four-star
                    general with the U.S. delegation to the Military Committee. There were no large
                    staff meetings the way other embassies have staff meetings. There were lots of
                    meetings all the time, but it was always the ambassador and the DCM or the
                    defense adviser or the political adviser with a few and that's how the work got
                    done. You would see what was happening if you followed the cable traffic, which
                    was voluminous. For one thing, NATO cables went to American embassies at all
                    NATO capitals. And much of the traffic wasn't particularly restricted within the
                    delegation unless it was EXDIS or NODIS. So if you just read your in-box in the
                    morning you would be up to date on what the other parts of your very large group
                    was up to. But that didn't mean that you were in on the discussions or
                    necessarily knew much about the substance. NATO had over 200 committees. They
                    were at different levels of expertise. The detail was staggering. So, if you
                    were a generalist, it was impossible to keep track of that and there was no time
                    to do it anyway. You had to do your own homework. But this absence of large
                    staff meetings certainly meant that the delegation was a little stovepiped.
                    There was also not as much contact as you might imagine across that corridor
                    separating the ambassador from the U.S. Milrep. The U.S. Milrep took his
                    instructions from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The ambassador took his
                    instructions from State. The Defense adviser took his instructions from the
                    Secretary of Defense. There was an interesting protocolary point. The Defense
                    adviser being the personal rep of the Secretary of Defense outranked every
                    military person in Europe and was entitled to his own aircraft, which the
                    ambassador was not. When we came to Brussels, one of the odd jobs that I was
                    asked to do was to do the protocol list. We had Foreign Service officers,
                    uniformed military, DOD civilians, and a few others as well. All of them had
                    different pay scales and rank scales and got promoted at different times. No
                    matter how you drew up your list on January 1, by February 1 it would be OBE,
                    because one group had gone through the promotion cycle and the other one had
                    not. Consequently, the list was a moving target. The interesting question for me
                    came at the top. Obviously, the ambassador headed the list. Bill Cargo, the DCM,
                    was two. But who was three? Was it going to be Tim Stanley, the DEFAD, or was it
                    going to be Tommy Wilson, the POLAD? Well, the pay they drew happened to be
                    identical. And the arrival at post was the same day. The traditional tests to
                    rank-order didn't work. And there was no good index by which you could say,
                    “Well, Tim goes first” or “Tommy goes first.” So, I did the whole list, about
                    five or six pages, single-spaced, because we had a lot of personnel, and left
                    that one with a big question mark and sent it up to Harlan with a memo that he
                    ought to decide it on the basis of looks. Shortly thereafter, someone else took
                    over responsibility for the USNATO protocol list.</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The U.S. was just beginning a long discussion with the Soviets on
                    arms control. It was then called SALT. Gerard Smith was thU.S. rep. The
                    negotiations were in different places but eventually there was a pattern where
                    most of it happened in Helsinki. It was staffed by a complex delegation
                    representing State, DOD, the Joint Chiefs, the White House, and people from
                    Energy. Since what was at stake were nuclear weapons, each of these demands of
                    the delegation had individual channels back to their principals in Washington,
                    not an unusual pattern for large and sensitive undertakings of this sort. Ray
                    Garthoff, my immediate boss, became the exec of that delegation. He came from
                    State. His druthers were strongly in favor of the route that SALT eventually
                    took toward START and agreed reductions by treaty. There were also bodies of
                    opinion in Washington that were opposed to this whole idea. And so it was a
                    tough and pretty contentious field to be working in. The big problems were
                    generally your own people, not so much the Soviets. For the first few years the
                    discussions did not much more than establish a basic common vocabulary between
                    the Soviets and the Americans. This was necessary because there had never been
                    such a discussion, nor was there a vocabulary with commonly understood terms.
                    Each bureaucracy had produced its own thinking about nuclear weapons and its
                    nomenclature. It was necessary to start merging these terms so that when you
                    used a term everybody would understand what was meant by it. This became a
                    highly esoteric exercise. In the end it was also of course a political thing. It
                    meant a major step toward working things out with the Soviets even though they
                    were still regarded as our enemy number one. I was the junior man on the totem
                    pole in the group of three at NATO who worked these issues. It meant that I
                    carrieSmith's briefcase when he came to brief the Council. I once crossed the
                    Atlantic in military aircraft sent to pick him up in Brussels. In due course we
                    established a pattern of briefings to keep our allies in NATO informed of these
                    discussions. The reward for that effort always came in the form of the NATO
                    communique at the meeting of the foreign ministers, when there would be a
                    paragraph about these negotiations. You can go back to the NATO communiques and,
                    if you string them together, you can get a picture of how these talks were
                    going. At the same time, we were negotiating in Geneva in the so-called CCD, the
                    Conference of the Committee of Disarmament, which at that time I think was an
                    18-country body, on a number of other issues. One was CW [chemical warfare].
                    Another was biological warfare. Still another was nuclear test ban. There were
                    other subjects like cutoff of the production of fissile materials, but no treaty
                    ever came out of that. But the kernel for later treaties were already there, and
                    there was activity. Not all NATO countries were involved in the CCD, but
                    representatives from allied countries at the CCD would come to Brussels and
                    brief the NATO Council. And the NATO Council would also express views other than
                    talks in the communiques. The process worked in terms of getting the whole West
                    used to the notion that the way to deal with these issues was through
                    negotiation and treaties. That indeed was what was going on. It meant that I had
                    to pay a great deal of attention to the cable traffic from all capitals on these
                    issues. I had to read through the extremely lengthy reports of all the sessions
                    in Geneva and be familiar with them. And it meant that I became part of a
                    coterie of diplomatic colleagues on other delegations whose job was identical to
                    mine. So I became part of a new fraternity - totally different from the civil
                    emergency planning fraternity - and one that was very busy with major issues
                    between East and West.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at pretty much the beginning of this whole
                        process. Was there a feeling that something was going to happen? Did you
                        feel that this was a political maneuver to keep talking while the old
                        standoff continued</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: Pretty much the former and not the latter. I think those of us at NATO
                    who were involved in it, right up to the ambassador Harlan Cleveland and, later,
                    Ambassador Bob Ellsworth, who succeeded Harlan when Nixon became president -
                    felt that this was the future. This was the way to go. We could deal with these
                    issues in this way. We were not yet at the point at which we arrived many years
                    later, and are in a way still now, at which people say agreements aren't worth
                    the paper they're written on, that you can't verify them anyway, so what's the
                    use? We operated with a sophisticated sense that verification would not always
                    be foolproof. In fact, it was usually one of the last things we discussed when
                    the treaty started taking form. But to get the basic principles down in treaty
                    form and blessed by the UniteNations was a long step forward toward setting
                    rules that provided a yardstick for behavior by major nuclear weapons states and
                    other states. That was regarded as a good thing, just as earlier my experience
                    with human rights had been that converting the Declaration of Human Rights into
                    treaty form didn't mean that people would all of a sudden stop torturing or stop
                    misbehaving, but at least there would be a global standard that conduct could be
                    measured against and a statement of what that conduct ought to be. That was a
                    basic philosophy behind arms control. On a narrower but strategic level, the
                    discussion with the Russians on nuclear weapons was thought to be a promising
                    way to mitigating the danger of nuclear war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was not aHelsinki and I was not in Geneva and there were no
                    Russians at NATO, so I can't answer that question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Soviets, you were with NATO in August of '68
                        when the Warsaw Pact moved in on Czechoslovakia. Did that send shockwaves
                        into NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It certainly did. It happened in the summer, in August, the way all
                    European crises seem to happen in Europe in summer. We had been conducting a
                    simulation exercise in the Situation Center with those of the staff who were not
                    on holiday. Then this event occurred. I remember Harlan sending a cable - Harlan
                    was at post - referring to the fact that the NATO ambassadors were on the
                    beaches. Then for about a day and a half, we ran the exercise in the mornings
                    and the real thing in the afternoon. Then we dropped the exercise and
                    concentrated on the real thing. It was a traumatic event. It required strong
                    U.S. leadership, which Washington provided and was executed masterfully by
                    Cleveland with his colleagues. Those of us who watched it had a sense - was at
                    that point still in Emergency Planning, but obviously I could watch - that here
                    was somebody running the show at NATO who knew how to do it with a sense of
                    confidence. On the other hand, it raised the old question that had been around
                    ever since John Foster Dulles, namely, at what point does the West do something
                    about these horrible situations that are within reach? The answer was nothing,
                    but to express this outrage and take care of the refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last time was '56 in Hungary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes, and so it was in '68 in the Czech Republic. It reinforced the
                    sense that the Soviets were a dictatorship. I don't recall any real discussion
                    about “Let's go out and send NATO troops.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did this change the thinking at all in that maybe the Soviets? Was this
                    considered a Soviet defensive thing or were the Soviets considered more of an
                    offensive threat after that?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: At NATO, the Soviets were always regarded as a potentially offensive
                    threat. The whole strategy of NATO was built on concepts of defense, of
                    absorbing the first shocks as much as possible, although it was realized that
                    much of western Germany would be overrun at first. It would be the task of the
                    Fifth CAV and the other army units to slow the Soviets down until the West could
                    marshal a response. This is where nuclear weapons were a major part of the
                    equation, because the Soviet conventional preponderance was enormous and the
                    balance came from the fact that there was an American guarantee - backed by
                    nuclear weapons - that was meant to keep this conventional preponderance in
                    check. In conventional weapons, there was simply no question that the Soviets
                    were preponderant. NATO really didn't have enough conventional forces nor
                    territory to fall back upon. Even if you counted the Turkish forces, which were
                    numerous but ill-equipped and not in the right place, the target would be
                    Germany and Berlin. In that sense the good thing was that Berlin being a target
                    would automatically trigger a serious American response. In retrospect, one
                    might argue that perhaps that balance assured stability of sorts and peace in
                    Europe for all those years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left NATO in '70, what was your impression of
                        whither the SALT/START-type negotiations were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I became progressively more detached from them as I got more involved
                    at NATO in the Geneva issues. But I think the widespread assumption in capitals
                    and at NATO was that they were on track, although it was by no means clear what
                    they would lead to in the end. This went very slowly. In a way, the agreement
                    which the Senate approved just yesterday, March 6, 2003, is in line of direct
                    succession to what was started way back then by Gerry Smith in the '60s, namely,
                    an agreement with the Russians governing the size of the stockpiles and their
                    use. A lot of things have changed, but SALT, and then START I and START II, was
                    seen by the arms control community as the most promising way to deal with this
                    issue among the superpowers. Today, it seems that, with the new thinking, all of
                    these assumptions are being questioned again and have lost some of the certainty
                    that surrounded them for so many years.</p>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was transferred from Brussels because Jim Leonard, our ambassador
                    to the CCD in Geneva and with whom I had been dealing, had tried to peel me away
                    from USNATO. I resisted that and the Department was not particularly anxious to
                    move me. The NATO delegation didn't want to lose me because my departure would
                    have triggered the immediate problems of replacing me off-cycle. So in the first
                    instance that effort failed. But Jim Leonard doesn't give up easily; In the
                    summer of '70, he got the bureaucracy to decide that I ought to be moved to
                    ACDA. So Ruth and I left a year before we thought we would be leaving and went
                    back to Washington, where I came back as an FSO on loan to another organization,
                    namely, ACDA, although it was located in the old State Department building. I
                    became part of an office, headed by Jim Leonard. The office had two branches.
                    One dealt with the CCD in Geneva. The other dealt with the MBFR (Mutual Balanced
                    Force Reduction) negotiations in Vienna. The MBFR office included a young
                    officer by the name of David Aaron, who is still around in a much different
                    capacity. I was part of the CCD branch. It was the more active part. We were
                    backstopping the Geneva delegation at their two annual long sessions in Geneva
                    (one in the spring and one in the summer). These sessions would last for about
                    three months. Then the delegation would return home. We would take our leaves in
                    August, and then all the CCD delegations would head for New York, where the CCD
                    work was on the agenda of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the
                    United Nations. We would spend 6-8 weeks in New York. So it was a fairly
                    peripatetic life for somebody based in Washington. And I became part of that
                    merry-go-round. We divided up the office so that half of us would go to Geneva
                    for one session and the other half would stay home. Then for the other session,
                    we reversed roles. The only one who went all the time was Jim Leonard, the
                    ambassador. His deputy in Geneva was either Pete Day in the spring or Alan
                    Neidle in the summer. Neidle was head of the branch that I was a part of. There
                    were about five or six of us. Half of us went with Day, and the other half with
                    Neidle. It was a very different kettle of fish from NATO. First of all, we were
                    Washington-based. I don't have to explain to an FSO the difference between being
                    overseas and being in Washington. Our life at NATO was totally dedicated to the
                    job 24 hours a day seven days a week. We were on call all the time, and in
                    meetings much of the time. Our families were part of the active social round
                    that went with it. Washington duty, in contrast, provided a dichotomy between
                    work and home. The only problem with Leonard, Day, and Neidle was that they
                    equated their notion of solid work with long hours in the office. It was the
                    habit of Jim, and particularly Alan Neidle not to recognize weekends too much,
                    although Sundays typically we were not in. But you would not want to be caught
                    not coming in for a good bit of time on Saturdays. That would have been all
                    right if there had been stuff to be done. But the style of Alan - and I'm
                    dwelling on it because it illustrates a larger point - was that he liked endless
                    discussions, and he liked to start them around 6:00 pm. For those with small
                    children, that was not a good time. But we had no way of escaping. So getting
                    home at 9:00 was the rule, and it was not appreciated often. I mention that
                    because it was still possible in those days to exercise a sort of a style of
                    leadership which in today's Foreign Service would not be sustainable. This is
                    probably one of the better things about the new Foreign Service. Eventually, I
                    learned that if you put your foot down you could get your way on the issue of
                    office hours. I should have learned it even earlier. Anyway, it was a good
                    lesson to remember not to ever do that to your own people. That said, the
                    company of Jim Leonard and Pete Day and Neidle was extraordinarily stimulating
                    because they were exceptionally experienced, thoughtful, and brainy. Alan was
                    different from the others. The other two were FSOs. Jim had been the man who had
                    come up with a solution to the capture by the North Koreans of the American spy
                    ship. Later on, he became the deputy to the Egyptian-Israeli peace effort. Pete
                    Day, later on, was Consul General in Jerusalem. I knew him from my Berlin days,
                    where he had been head of the political section. They were accomplished FSOs.
                    Neidle was an arms control expert and buff. So, it was a solid crowd. We were
                    backed up in Geneva by other people who were good. Our delegation even had the
                    old problem that different people had different channels back to Washington. The
                    JCS representative was therefore not really under Jim's control; neither was the
                    DOD representative. The Agency had their own people. One of the junior officers
                    was JohNegroponte, now U.S. PermRep in New York. So the work in Washington was a
                    grind. Geneva was also a grind, but of a very different sort. The CCD would meet
                    only twice in the week, Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was meeting with the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: No, meeting with the 18 countries of the CCD. This was not bilateral.
                    These were morning sessions. They would last for 2-3 hours. They consisted of
                    speeches which were basically long expositions of policy but often with people
                    holding their cards. Many didn't really move the negotiations further. The
                    drivers of the process were typically the Russians and the Americans, although
                    on occasion Mrs. Myrdal of Sweden or the Mexicans, Robledo or Jorge Castaneda,
                    father of the man who recently resigned as foreign minister, who would play a
                    major role. But basically we had the goods because we had the expertise. The
                    British were always strong, too. Other countries, elected to the CCD by the
                    General Assembly just because of the luck of the draw or regional rotation, had
                    little to contribute to these fairly complex issues of arms control. Typically,
                    we'd go to the Palais on Tuesday and Thursday and mill around for about 45
                    minutes just to get the scuttlebutt. It was just an elaborate dance of queen
                    bees around each other. Then you'd sit down for the long speeches and you'd take
                    notes. Then you'd spend all afternoon doing the reporting cables which were of
                    Kissingerian proportions in the sense that the habit was to report in immense
                    detail. The frustrating thing was that the officer who was always the editor was
                    an FSO who had got stuck in that position and had done it for a long time.
                    Walter Givan had been an English professor at one time in his life. He felt that
                    whatever drafts we gave him needed to be entirely rewritten. Then we would get
                    it back around 6:00 p.m. or later. So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, dinner was always
                    late. After a while, we reporting officers knew that whatever we did, and no
                    matter how well we did, Walter would redo the draft his way and then kick it
                    back. The motivation to do a really good job the first time around evaporated
                    because it really didn't matter what we put down because we knew it was going to
                    be changed. Thinking back in my later jobs to that type of reporting, it was
                    pretty pointless to do it that way. Obviously, there were other cables that Jim
                    or Pete or Alan would send that would take one little- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>So there were ways in which the delegation could speak to Washington meaningfully
                    in more typical shorter messages. But the extensive style of basic reporting,
                    which I saw replicated later by Jock Dean out of Vienna on MBFR, and also by the
                    Kissinger staff, which also was required to do virtually verbatim reporting,
                    produced unmanageable stuff for the consumer. I suppose the only thing that
                    could be said for it was that it would all be there and that no one in
                    Washington could take offense that emphasis had been given to something at the
                    expense of something else. But for the months that I was back here and had to
                    read through that stuff, I can't say that it really taught me much. It didn't
                    really advance anything, my understanding least of all. And so I found the whole
                    thing a fairly wasteful-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these speeches about? Were these just to get
                        things off people's chests?</hi>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Let's take the BW Convention as an example. The first round, which
                    might take an entire session of three months, might go no further than people
                    recounting historical tales about the possible use of BW, usually referring to
                    the parallel with CW which, of course, had been used in the first world war.
                    These speeches were basically moodsetters. Of course, it wouldn't lead to
                    anything, because there was no draft on the table. But the mood was set. Then,
                    maybe the next year, the delegations would return to Geneva with instructions
                    that would instruct us to explore the possibility of a text. That might take
                    another three months of very carefully feeling each other out. At that point,
                    the nature of the speeches would change somewhat. And t hen, when a draft text
                    finally appeared, the speeches would focus immediately on that text. The BW
                    Convention had to do with defining what these weapons were, defining the
                    prohibition, and defining monitoring, if not verification, systems. We would go
                    through endless possible permutations of a text. The human mind being inventive,
                    it was extraordinary what some of the delegations would want to add or come up
                    with. Ultimately, as in the negotiations that I had gone through on human rights
                    treaties, when it came to writing arms control treaties, every country's main
                    interest was to ensure that the text would not adversely affect anything that
                    country either had done, was doing, might want to do in the future or, better
                    yet, justify what they might want to do in the future. There were hidden motives
                    galore. A class of schoolchildren might see the CCD as a straightforward
                    exercise saying, “Let's get rid of BW and let's write a treaty to prohibit it
                    and let's go home and be happy.” This was hardly the way it worked in the real
                    world. It was sensitive. National security was at stake. I recall one occasion
                    when I was back in Washington. We had completed the BW Convention in Geneva. We
                    needed one more signature from Henry Kissinger himself. He was still in the
                    White House. I sat around for three weeks every night waiting for the phone call
                    saying that Henry had signed off on the approval cable. The paperwork was in his
                    in-box and it was emerging to the top of his in-box. For three weeks, that call
                    never came. For three weeks, everybody in Geneva was treading water. The United
                    States had not actually said, “Yes” and we couldn't say “Yes” because we hadn't
                    got a Washington position cleared. The Russians had the same problem getting
                    their stuff cleared in Moscow. It was a snail's pace affair. The nature of the
                    speeches therefore would go in all directions. Some of them were extraordinarily
                    boring. Some of them were extraordinarily interesting. Some of them were highly
                    technical, and above my capacity to understand precursors, and agents, and a
                    combination of agents, and what they could do, and how you could measure the
                    effect and what the lethality would be, and so forth and so on. The BW treaty
                    was noteworthy in retrospect because it did not have a verification set of
                    provisions at the end and that was regarded by later administrations and
                    political critics as failure. The CW Convention had more robust verification
                    measures built into it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would there be a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Because there are differences between cows and horses. They were
                    different things.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering about verification. You would think
                        if you had robust verification procedures in one, you would have robust
                        verification procedures in the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Verification had to do with where inspectors might have to go, which
                    industries had to open up, whether government would agree that certain
                    industries might be opened up, or what parts of its territory might want to be
                    opened for inspection. The Russians were unwilling to allow access for
                    verification purposes to those areas where they had their BW program. Of course,
                    our aim was to do so. So there would be an elaborate fencing match on just how
                    to word the treaty. You could achieve only what was the minimum common
                    denominator, what 18 countries would be willing to sign on to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there were strong elements in the
                        American defense industry, the Pentagon, of saying, “Hell, no, we're not
                        going to let somebody go into our areas?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: As witSTART and SALT, some of the most difficult negotiations were
                    in-house. Later on, after Paul Nitze's Walk in the Woods episode, Nitze's
                    challenge was not his Soviet opposite number - although he eventually walked out
                    - but it was the Washington bureaucracy. This was not a field in which you had a
                    lot of do-gooders and high motivations and everything was easy. These issues
                    were handled by people who were extraordinarily conscious of not doing anything
                    would inhibit them or would be politically possible. If you multiplied that by
                    the number of countries that would eventually have to approve, it was a miracle
                    that we did get a CW treaty and the BW Convention not only through the CCD in
                    Geneva, but through the General Assembly of the UN in New York later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that this would be something that? How did
                        this fit your personality? “Let's get on with this. This is screwing up my
                        family life and everything else.” I am not talking about just you, but the
                        others.</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That element was certainly part of all of those who were involved in
                    the CCD. I'm sure it was also part of all of those involved in those years of
                    START and SALT. In arms control, the system produced its experts. They got not
                    only so hooked on the subject but also became so indispensable that they ended
                    up spending the rest of their lives doing that subject in some form or another.
                    The pattern of their professional lives meant that they were living apart from
                    their families for months on end most of the year. This has all sorts of side
                    effects. Some people could handle that easily. But I did see some marriages go
                    on the rocks. I did see cases of misbehavior of the sort you see on an
                    oceanliner. The minute the boat throws off the hawsers, everybody gets drunk and
                    misbehaves. The minute they get to shore, everybody resumes behaving. The arms
                    control world had an element of this. The attraction to me was Geneva. I loved
                    that city and I felt much at home. I had been there for Law of the Sea and here
                    L was again, for months on end. We lived in hotels. If we could rent rooms
                    somewhere that's what we did, or we doubled up. Sometimes you could escape into
                    the mountains. New York in the fall was always exciting. The atmosphere of the
                    General Assembly in the First Committee was heady. Occasionally, in the evening,
                    you could see something of New York. On the other hand, families were in
                    Washington - and there wasn't enough time on the weekends to go home very often.
                    And when we were in Geneva we couldn't go home. Occasionally, wives or couples
                    without children would come over and join. In the MBFR case, ultimately the
                    United States decided that we would assign families to Vienna. For the CCD, that
                    was always an issue. We never did it. Other countries, such as the British,,
                    did. The U.S. ambassador to the CCD was Washington-based. The British ambassador
                    had a house in Geneva. This made more sense, because he was there 7-8 months of
                    the year anyway. We didn't do that. We could have done that differently. SALT
                    was in Helsinki. MBFR was in Vienna. CSCE, later on, convened in many places.
                    People did take long-term leases. These were not 9:00 to 5:00 jobs. They
                    absorbed your whole existence in a way that was sometimes hard to explain to
                    anybody who was not a part of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I spent two years in ACDA. Then the question was, where can I go
                    next? Because of the way I came into the Service, I did not have the recognition
                    quotient in any particular bureau except the IO Bureau. I didn't want to stay in
                    ACDA. But what to do next? What happened was that John Baker, an East European
                    hand, was director for Eastern Europe. My wife had worked with John in Rome. She
                    mentioned my availability to him. He needed a Romanian desk officer, and he took
                    me sight unseen. So I found myself paneled to become the Romanian and Albanian
                    desk officer in EUR in the summer of 1972.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: For two years, '73 and '74.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The answer is very simple. We had no relations with Albania. We
                    hadn't had relations since 1945. Of course, there had been no effective
                    relations even earlier, during World War II. But it was a country that was
                    aligned mostly with communist China. It was an outcast in the European Communist
                    bloc. It was a closed country. There was very little news coming out of it.
                    There were few people going into it, certainly not Americans. There was an
                    Albanian diaspora in the United States in Brooklyn and in Worcester, Mass., and
                    somewhere in the middle west as well, but they didn't constitute any significant
                    presence in domestic political terms. There was nobody on the Hill of Albanian
                    extraction, nor was there any particular interest in Albania in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All this is terribly important in the American context of

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We did have the occasional appearance in Washington of the son oKing
                    Zog, a gentleman of enormous length and stature named Leka. I think his
                    nationality was Australian. He had some property here in Virginia and from time
                    to time he appeared and sought recognition on the Hill, without much success. I
                    never met him and he was never a factor in our relationship with Albania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any talk during your time about opening
                        relations with Albania? We hadn't had relations with China and all of a
                        sudden this was a period we were beginning to start to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was generally recognized that any opening to Eastern Europe was
                    far off, and that in that process Albania would be at the bottom of the list.
                    The country had no strategic significance for us, except perhaps as a political
                    outpost for Chinese communism in contradistinction to Soviet communism. In that
                    sense, it was of interest to us, since Albania was a thorn in the Soviet
                    communist side. That is about as far as it went. I did address the issue of
                    relations with Albania in an article I wrote at the time. It got approved for
                    publication. It was a minor thing. It was a speculative piece, making the point
                    that resumption of relations would be a slow process. But there was no basis for
                    believing that this was going to happen anytime soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to Romania. This was really your work, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Romania was really my work. It was a full-time job. Desk officers
                    catch all sorts of stray cats and dogs, so they're never lost for things to do.
                    Romania was clearly in the lower tier of those countries that the European
                    Bureau was looking after. For me it was a complete change of pace. I had been in
                    high pressure, high visibility posts as a junior officer. Here I was basically
                    in charge of a very minor slice of the pie. It just gave me a different role.
                    Compared to the two immediately preceding years iACDA, working conditions were
                    much better, because at least they were sort of 8:30 to 5:30 and not on the
                    weekends. I was at that point 30 years old and this job gave me my first
                    experience in bilateral diplomacy. So a whole lot of things were new to me. For
                    instance, the role of the care and feeding of the needs of the post, which would
                    extend from personnel matters to matters having to do with guidance and policy.
                    A lot of them were pretty pedestrian issues, the typical management of how to
                    keep a post going in a difficult climate overseas. Given the communications and
                    unlike the posts I had been used to, where we did everything by cable, the guts
                    of my office's exchanges with Embassy Bucharest consisted of an exchange by
                    letters via pouch, which I would produce every Friday and which the DCM, my
                    opposite number at the embassy, would produce every Thursday. And so each week
                    there was mail crossing in the pouch. That kept me and the post apprized as to
                    what was going on and what we did. Looking back it was a strange way of
                    operating. Today, this would all be done by cable traffic or classified e-mail.
                    But we were still relying very much on the pouch in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived on the desk, what were you getting from
                        your colleagues of how we looked upon Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That was a subject that did not take a long time getting used to.
                    There were two things about Ceausescu. One was that he was a dictator of a
                    particularly unpleasant and virulent kind. The other was that he had been kind
                    to Richard Nixon when Nixon had been out of office. Consequently, as president
                    Nixon had residual good feelings away from the fact that he had been treated
                    well by Ceausescu during his years in the political wilderness. So there was a
                    paradox. My two visits to the post certainly underlined the first of these two
                    observations. I saw a very repressive regime in action, this time not an
                    EasGerman one but in a way an even nastier one. At least it wasn't directly
                    dependent on Moscow. It was something of its own and it was a pity to see a
                    country with rich cultural history and an elegant language, and made up of
                    interesting and nice people, suppressed by a person of the type of Ceausescu.
                    But we did deal with Ceausescu. In fact, Ceausescu came to the United States on
                    a state visit during my time on the desk. All the stops were pulled out. He was
                    in fact the last state visitor to the Nixon White House. I remember the sunny
                    day, the band on the lawn of the White House. As the desk officer, Ruth and I
                    were at the tail end of the receiving line. I still have a picture of that. Both
                    Ceausescus were there. After the visit, we had lots of stories to tell about how
                    difficult the retinue were that the Ceausescus brought along, and how paranoid
                    they were about themselves and their security. They were also socially ill at
                    ease and maladroit. The Nixons also looked uncomfortable. So, it was an
                    interesting sight to see those four on the White House lawn, not knowing how to
                    deal with one another in a nice way. It was really like a stage set of Japanese
                    puppets.</p>
                <p>Q: I've heard that the Ceausescus were not a fun couple to entertain for those
                    who were trying to make their visit a pleasant one.</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: She was a pill and he was something slightly less than a pill. There
                    were no smiles, no laughs. It was all seriousness. Of course, in that
                    environment they were on strange territory and would have been ill at ease even
                    under normal circumstances. But they were not fun. Some of the other Romanians I
                    dealt with were of a different sort. The Romanian ambassador in Washington,
                    Corneliu Bogdan, was a wise and considerate diplomat. He was one of the few Jews
                    in the Romanian service. After the turn of events in Europe, he played a major
                    role, but only very briefly because he had a heart attack and died. This was a
                    pity for his country and for him. Some of the embassy personnel were cultivated,
                    I had good relations with them, and I saw them fairly regularly. I discovered
                    later that one of them had already been turned by my colleagues in the Agency,
                    eventually received political asylum, and disappeared into the woodwork of
                    American society.</p>
                <p>That said, Romania posed problems for us. They targeted our people, sometimes
                    successfully. The Romanian security services were excellent. We had difficulties
                    in that respect. The methods were the traditional ones, basically operating with
                    knowledge of personal behavior that could lead to-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Compromising pictures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Those were compromising conversations, pictures, other situations. We
                    had to be very careful. On my first visit there, I was put up in a hotel. Within
                    half an hour they changed my room. Then, the embassy decided that I'd better go
                    and stay with the DCM. So it was just like East Germany. I knew I was being
                    bugged, being watched. I took a trip with John Baker and Jonathan Rickert, our
                    control officer, through Romania, visiting the German-speaking part of the
                    country. I was surprised and pleased to find that German was the predominant
                    language in some areas. Many left before the events of 1990 and managed to
                    emigrate back to Germany. Still there is a good German residue in Romania, a
                    Lutheran German minority. It is a beautiful country. It was very poor. And very
                    poorly run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at the country as being itself poor?
                        Romania had oil, not a lot, but solid oil. It had what must have been
                        terribly fertile country at the mouth of the Danube and the delta and all
                        that. Or maybe it wasn't as rich as it would seem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It wasn't as rich as it would seem. The oil was there and it was a
                    source of income. The facilities, however, were antiquated and the industry was
                    in bad shape. I don't recall the agricultural situation except that there was no
                    hunger. This suggested to me that the Romanians produced enough to feed
                    themselves. But the Securitate was everywhere and it was a society that was
                    deathly afraid of their neighbors, or anyone else. There were many informers.
                    The penalties for being caught as a nonconformist were severe. They would not
                    get shot, but life could be made very unpleasant if you did not conform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some of these social things that one heard
                        about later on, about promoting children, the production of children without
                        really taking care of them and social engineering? Or did that come
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We found out about that later. At the time, we didn't really know
                    about that simply because we didn't have that sort of access. None of the
                    western diplomats in Romania did. The embassies did a lot of talking to each
                    other. There was one diplomatic club, where everybody went for entertainment -
                    tennis, swimming. You needed permission to go on a trip. There was tight control
                    over what the foreign diplomatic establishment could do, observe, and help
                    with.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I ought to mention Harry Barnes. My time on the desk spanned two ambassadors. One
                    was Leonard Meeker, for whom I worked before in L. At that time he was assistant
                    legal adviser. He became deputy legal adviser and eventually Legal Adviser.
                    Following that, he became ambassador to Romania. On my first visit, he and his
                    wife, Beverley, were in residence in Bucharest. I remember the visit because,
                    ahead of their times, Beverley had put up “no smoking” signs in the residence.
                    This was a shocking thing, because every Romanian smoked. A lot of the
                    Westerners did, too. But she was an environmentally conscious person and
                    insisted on her way. Barnes was an activist ambassador. I went through getting
                    him prepped in Washington before he went out, and got a measure of him. A
                    marvelous man fu ll of energy, imagination, and boundless ideas. It turned out
                    that he was so good at reaching out to Romanians - the few that he could reach
                    out to in his time as chief of mission - that when the time came for him to
                    leave, the reaction of the people he had befriended was one of bitter
                    disappointment. Here was a case of an ambassador who, in a way, had overdone it,
                    leaving impressions and creating hopes that he could not possibly fulfill. He
                    did what came naturally to him, but it came at a price of the feelings of a lot
                    of his Romanian friends who saw in him the promise of a better future which at
                    the time did not materialize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Romania was touted as being sort of like Yugoslavia. Were
                        we able to use Romania in reaching the Eastern bloc, the eastern communist
                        world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: If the president or then Secretary of State Kissinger had any grand
                    designs among these lines, they were carefully hidden from the desk officer. I
                    did have to bear in mind that the president had a soft spot for Ceausescu and
                    therefore for Romania. That was what permitted the state visit to go forward,
                    even though it seemed rather incongruous at the time. Romania, however, saw
                    itself as a broker on a number of global issues, Perhaps its imagination as to
                    what it might do exceeded its actual ability to do so. But it was not unusual to
                    come upon Romanian diplomatic activity, whether in arms control, in East-West
                    relations, or in relations with China. This made Romania interesting to watch.
                    At the time, we had to assess how much was smoke and how much was fire and
                    whether this would be useful to us, or not useful to us. So Romania was not a
                    passive country. The Romanians stirred themselves without having behind them an
                    entire nonaligned movement, as did Yugoslavia. They played a role in the
                    nonaligned movement, but not a leadership role. They carved out their role as an
                    individual country. This reflected Ceausescu's vision of himself and of his
                    country in Europe and in the world. In my opinion, this vision never really
                    amounted to much. In retrospect, I don't think that there is much left of any
                    Romanian footprints on the course of history of those years. But for me it did
                    mean following the cable traffic carefully, because you never know. Some report
                    from somewhere in the world might come in indicating that the Romanians were up
                    to something. In that sense, it was an interesting assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that with Romania meddling in the policies
                        of the big boys and thinking that it was a much greater player than not, you
                        as a desk officer would find yourself? You had to run around and clear
                        things and check on things. The people who were representing the more
                        serious countries like the Soviets or the Chinese or something like that
                        would sort of say, “Go away. Don't bother us.” Did you find yourself having
                        to intrude in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Because of the known interest of the president, if there was
                    something for me to say about Romania, it was not that difficult to bring
                    something to a person's attention. We had a pretty good system in the European
                    Bureau for sifting information and making sure that what was important got to
                    the top and what wasn't was put aside. I don't recall being stiffed on anything
                    in particular. I was supported by the fact that I had two articulate ambassadors
                    at post who could speak up for themselves, and often did. But Romania was not a
                    friend. Romania was on the other side of the East-West divide. And while it may
                    have been up to its own game, it was not a country that we could in any respect
                    count on. The sum total for me of the experience was to learn how to deal with
                    American colleagues who were behind the Iron Curtain rather than right on the
                    border or on the western side of it, and to be able to watch the evolution of
                    events with a certain degree of patience. Certainly, the eventual evolution of
                    what happened, and the death of Ceausescu, were not possible to foretell at that
                    point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served a little before this in Yugoslavia. There all of
                        us who served in the embassy had a certain respect for Tito. We weren't 100%
                        for him but we had a respect for him. Did you find any respect for
                        Ceausescu</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: No. If there was any respect, it was respect for the way in which the
                    man exercised power. We saw Ceausescu as he was. Obviously, I didn't see him in
                    Bucharest. I did observe Ceausescu in Washington - and on the trip that the
                    United States offered him after the visit to Washington. I was part of the group
                    that traveled along with him on the same plane. He was a dour person; no sense
                    of humor. But he had his country's interests at mind. We went to the White
                    Company in Cleveland, which made huge tractor machinery. We went to General
                    Electric outside of Hartford, Connecticut. He was interested in putting Romania
                    on the map and making connections with big industry. American industry, of
                    course, was interested in the possibilities of doing business. So on that trip,
                    Ceausescu got a pretty nice reception. The trip was fast. We spent two and a
                    half days hopping around the Northeast before I saw him off at Kennedy
                    airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Ceausescu had pretensions to being a scientific
                        marvel. She had fake degrees in science, didn't she? Did you have to play
                        the game of saying, “You must be interested in seeing the science
                        labs?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We did not have a special program for Mrs. C. In Washington she went
                    right along with her husband. This was a state visit and a state visit is a set
                    bit of pieces, many of which are social. She was on the same plane, she went to
                    the same factories. She didn't really have a role of her own. I think she sort
                    of kept behind him as they were touring the plants and making conversation and
                    doing the visits. But she was a pill and she looked the part. She was no
                    fun.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In late '74, you had reinserted yourself into the
                        mainstream of the European Bureau. Had that taken?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: I think I was by then really a part of EUR. I had had three assignments
                    in Europe. Two of them had been pretty visible. The Romanian job was not, but at
                    least I was in the Bureau. That provided a special type of visibility within
                    that tight and close society all of its own called the European Bureau.</p>
                <p>I ought to digress and tell an anecdote which we can cut from the record later on
                    if you want. Many years later when we had the problem with one of our colleagues
                    in Vienna, Felix Bloch, and the difficulties he was in-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of an unresolved case, but it looks that he
                        was a spy for the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There were two things about him. One was personal behavior unbecoming
                    of an officer of the United States., which is documented and was never
                    contested. The other, mainly of spying, was never proven. Under the rule that
                    you were innocent until proven guilty, the United States government never
                    established that case. But it was all over the newspapers. My anecdote is about
                    the European Bureau and how the people from within view it. I recall talking
                    with Avis Bohlen about the case. I said, “It's pretty bad, isn't it?” She said,
                    “Yes, it's terrible for the Bureau.” She could have said it was terrible for the
                    United States or for the Foreign Service or for the State Department. But to her
                    it was terrible for EUR. It was the Bureau that mattered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of the premier bureau of the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That's certainly how the members of the Bureau saw themselves, much
                    to the annoyance of many colleagues outside of EUR.</p>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: EUR had a self-image that was special.</p>
                <p>In any event, what happened then was that I was sent for a year of training.
                    There was a choice of the various defense colleges - NDU, the Imperial Defence
                    College in London, Harvard, Princeton. I was sent to Princeton. That was a very
                    fortunate turn of events. First of all, the programs at each of these schools
                    were different. Harvard required a fairly steady dose of course work followed by
                    some sort of certificate; now it's a degree. Princeton traditionally had had a
                    system where the mid-career officials - typically including two State officers
                    and a whole bunch from other parts in the federal government and someone from
                    the New Jersey state government - were all on campus for a year without any
                    specific requirements. That is to say, we could spent the time any way we
                    wanted. The only requirement was a custom to lunch together in Woodrow Wilson's
                    old house on Wednesdays, sometimes with a speaker. Informally, the group did
                    some social things together. But we were left to our own devices. The Department
                    treated it like a posting. We got orders. We rented out our house in Bethesda.
                    We moved to Princeton, put our children in school. And then came the moment of
                    panic, because here are over 700 courses open to you and what are you going to
                    do without anybody telling you what to do? But once that moment of panic had
                    passed and decisions had been taken, the rest of the year was marvelous. It was
                    a way of being away from State and from the Foreign Service, back in a
                    university environment of which I could imagine none better - and I say to as
                    somebody with two Yale and one Columbia degrees. The year at Princeton was
                    fabulous. A very nice physical environment. A good school for the children. And
                    the chance- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Q: What type of courses did you take? Was it a focused one or an eclectic?</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Eclectic more or less. I took only two courses for credit, one in the
                    fall with Klaus Knorr, a political scientist who was good about military forces
                    and force planning and MBFR was a major issue in those day. Klaus was a big name
                    on the academic circuit. The other course was with Fred Greenstein, who is still
                    there today, who taught a course on the presidency. In the class we divided up
                    presidents. Each member of the class took one president and one key presidential
                    adviser and did a major paper on how that White House functioned with that
                    particular adviser. I picked or was assigned Kennedy and did my paper on Mac
                    Bundy. Fred and I actually went up to New York and had an interview with Bundy.
                    I had some other sources at Yale as to what he had done as an undergraduate. So
                    I had a chance to really think, then write about what Mac had done during his
                    time. That paper is still kicking around the halls of the Woodrow Wilson School
                    Library, now called the Stokes Library. Fred was a wonderful teacher. He not
                    only had us go through the literature on the subject, which is considerable, but
                    also had us talk through how particular White Houses worked. Our individual
                    papers brought that out even more clearly. So, for a Foreign Service officer to
                    spend some four months thinking about how the White House operates, how
                    decisions get made, what influences a president, how presidential style matters,
                    how the organization of the White House can influence the outcome, all of those
                    things were extremely useful for an FSO who until then had looked at the
                    Washington machinery of decisionmaking through the optic of the State
                    Department. The longer I was in Washington and the longer I am there even today,
                    I see this was a false optic. I'm not sure quite what the right optic is to
                    observe Washington decisionmaking. Perhaps the best source for that would be a
                    foreign ambassador. But to look at it from the inside of a particular department
                    is not going to give you a very good or useful overview. So the Princeton
                    experience helped in that respect. And it gave Ruth and me a chance to let our
                    hair down a little bit and have a normal family life, and have a social life
                    only of our own making, which was very modest, in a very pleasant surrounding.
                    It was a break that came at the right time. In retrospect, I'm very strongly in
                    favor of that sort of-</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was all around us, but Princeton isn't Washington. There was a lot
                    more distance between me and that issue as seen from Princeton than had I been
                    in Washington. Before Princeton, my Washington carpool consisted of nothing but
                    FSOs. The morning issue of “The Washington Post” and its daily reporting on
                    Watergate was the main subject of discussion. It was our bread and butter. It
                    was our breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the hour that we were in the car
                    together. On the way home, often the same thing. In Princeton, that sort of
                    sense of immediacy wasn't there for me. Obviously, the campus was aware of
                    Watergate but I don't recall any major demonstrations or anything of that sort.
                    This was happening in Washington and Washington was pretty far away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '75, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: While at Princeton, my personnel officer was Don Norland. Don, both
                    of whose sons later went into the Foreign Service, had at one time been
                    political counselor in The Hague. He came to the idea that I should pick up the
                    job that he had once held in The Hague. So, even before bidding time, which was
                    much simpler in those days, it was Norland who was on to me with the thought
                    that I ought to go to The Hague. I considered that for a moment, because that
                    was the one assignment that I knew I would never get in the Foreign Service. I
                    never even considered it and certainly not aimed for it. I came from the
                    Netherlands, so it struck me as wholly unlikely that the Department would ever
                    want to send me back there. So this idea was totally out of the box as far as I
                    was concerned. I must have expressed sentiments to that effect at the time, but
                    Norland was not easily dissuaded. Eventually, after thinking about it, I said,
                    “certainly.” If that's what the Department wants to do with me, I'll give it my
                    best shot. The more I thought about it, the more interesting the whole idea
                    became. With that green light, Norland took it from there. I never had to
                    campaign for that particular position and I never had anybody else pull for me.
                    Ambassador Kingdon Gould didn't know me from Adam. Neither did Charlie Tanguy,
                    the DCM. So, this was a case where Personnel made the decision. So in the summer
                    of 1975, I set off for The Hague.</p>

                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Kingdon Gould, a political appointee and a very successful
                    businessman from Maryland. In manners and pedigree, Ambassador Gould was a man
                    of the old school. He was a Yale graduate. Mrs. Gould was a spirited
                    ambassador's wife. She had wonderful taste. Her manner of speaking reminded me
                    of Katharine Hepburn. But I didn't know Kingdon and he didn't know me. There was
                    no ambassadorial input in my selection as political counselor. The Hague was not
                    a large embassy. The political section consisted of two officers and a local
                    assistant. The economic section consisted of three American officers. Two were
                    Americans in the public affairs section. The DAO had its usual complement. So
                    did agriculture. So all together we were maybe 30 Americans, with the usual
                    complement of local employees. There were consulates in Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
                    The U.S. Air Force had a wing in Soesterberg. The Netherlands is a western
                    country, a member of NATO and of the UN, and a large investor</p>
                <p>In the United States. So there were many contact points between the United States
                    and the Netherlands. Earlier, Gould had been ambassador in Luxembourg. The Hague
                    was his second ambassadorial post. There was some Dutch feeling that he had
                    gotten the job only because he was a contributor to the Republican Party. In
                    essence, that was probably true. In any event, Gould was a great representative
                    of the United States. Being a businessman, he sought out businessmen. He had a
                    winning way about him. He was also a keen sportsman. When the time came to
                    celebrate our 200th anniversary as a country, Kingdon had the idea of organizing
                    a huge bash, renting the entire Hague conference center, and putting on a
                    five-day show of speeches, lectures, visits, exhibits, and what have you. All of
                    us in the embassy were dubious about doing this. We thought this could never be
                    pulled off. Kingdon said we were going ahead. He set up an independent legal
                    entity, cleared it through the Office of the Legal Adviser. Then he scheduled
                    golf games with his unsuspecting Dutch business friends. So as he played golf
                    with friends from Unilever, Shell, and Phillips, he got them to contribute to
                    our national birthday party. He got the funds together and under his leadership,
                    we put together one hell of a fine program. Even as it was happening, some of us
                    had doubts that this would succeed, but Kingdon had no doubts, and he was right
                    and we were not. This was a case where the ambassador was way ahead of his
                    troops. He pulled off something that we did not have the imagination nor the
                    clout to do ourselves. So, that is a sample of where Kingdon made a
                    difference.</p>

                <p>He played hockey and became a member of a senior hockey team. He was also a good
                    rider. He had been doing a lot of riding iMaryland. In fact, he had actually
                    ridden in the Maryland Hunt Cup, which is a very difficult race. He was a fox
                    hunter and he responded to repeated invitations to join fox hunts in the south
                    oHolland, and took me along. He was a marvelous host. He was extraordinarily
                    gracious. He had good relations with Foreign Minister Van Der Stoel and with
                    pretty much the entire top level of the Dutch government. Many came to
                    appreciate him. He did spend a fair amount of time in the office. Sometimes he
                    felt that he had to answer his own mail, until we advised him that he had a
                    staff to help him do that. His consistent instinct was to help out people who
                    were in trouble. So, even right up until this year, my wife and I have been
                    getting unexpected telephone calls from Kingdon to help out, say, some Nigerian
                    whose widow's son needed help getting him into school here. These often were
                    far-out good causes, but Kingdon always engaged for good causes. He put his own
                    money behind a lot of them. The Goulds became, and have remained, dear friends
                    of Ruth and myself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, what was the state of
                        Dutch-American relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The state of Dutch-American relations is almost always good. My
                    period in The Hague was no exception. The Dutch were the third largest investor
                    in the United States. Americans were the third largest investors in the
                    Netherlands. A lot of enterprises were Dutch-American. So, in that large realm,
                    things took care of themselves without intervention by the United States
                    government or the American Embassy in The Hague.</p>
                <p>The issues that we did face had to do with how to deal with the threat of Soviet
                    communism and in particular the nuclear threat of the Soviet SS20s. I witnessed
                    the beginning of the discussion on what eventually became the issue of
                    stationing UN middle-range nuclear missiles in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pershing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Cruise and Pershing. The Dutch popular attitude on that issue was
                    strongly anti-nuclear. There is a long history in the Netherlands, visible right
                    up to today, of neutrality and antiwar feelings. The basic distaste for anything
                    that wears a uniform was a constant element in Dutch political life. So the
                    Dutch armed forces also were not held in high regard. The Dutch armed services
                    had been unable to perform effectively in 1940 against the Germans, nor, after
                    the war, in Indonesia. The Dutch tradition was anti-militaristic. The job of
                    defense minister was generally viewed as a liability to the political career of
                    the officeholder like the way it is in Germany today. So, the question of
                    putting nuclear weapons in the Netherlands was a lightning rod. In my time there
                    were one million signatures out of a population of about 14 million on a
                    petition opposing the steps that the U.S. and NATO were proposing to take. The
                    Dutch government was led by a social democrat, Joop den Uijl. The defense
                    minister, Vredeling, was also a social democrat. From their party point of view
                    and their whole upbringing they were instinctively not in favor of deployment.
                    They were supporters of NATO, but their notion of NATO was of a comfortable
                    organization under whose umbrella the Dutch could live safely. Who took care of
                    the repair of the umbrella, and its use, wasn't really up to the Dutch. That was
                    up to the Americans, and the Dutch trusted the Americans well enough to be
                    comfortable with that situation. The notion of stepping up to the nuclear plate
                    themselves was a politically unsellable proposition. In the end, it was the
                    efforts of initially Gould, and later, Bob McCloskey, and eventually, Jerry
                    Bremer that helped bring the Dutch government - and by that time it was a
                    different Dutch government - around to agree to join the NATO decision and
                    participate in this program, thereby making it possible for Germany not to be
                    the only country with Italy to station the allied nuclear response to the SS20
                    threat, to go ahead with the program. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The issue essentially was, the Soviets had threatened
                        Europe with the SS20 and our idea was to have a counterpart which would then

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: To create a balance. That was the idea. But it did involve the
                    introduction of new weapons, and that was not regarded as?</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any aftermath to what turned into a running sore with our
                    demonstrations of quite rowdy young people against our consulate general in
                    Amsterdam during the Vietnam War? This was not particularly benign. This was
                    kind of a nasty confrontation. Was that over with completely? Or were they
                    picking up something else?</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Anti-U.S. feelings on the score of Vietnam had been strong in the
                    Netherlands. In typical Dutch fashion, those who felt that way were allowed to
                    vent their views and the rest of the population stood on the sidelines, many of
                    them silently agreeing, but basically letting them go ahead. Police attitude
                    toward protection was always mild, far milder than I later saw it in Germany.
                    Just incidentally, just two weeks ago, when I happened to be in the Netherlands,
                    there was a demonstration about Iraq. The demonstrators took down the fence that
                    is now around the embassy, and daubed it with paint. The police, according to
                    the account that I read, gently removed the demonstrators. I'm sure that nobody
                    spent any time in detention for what they did, although the Dutch government, of
                    course, will pay for the damage that was done, which means removing the paint.
                    That is a typical Dutch way of doing these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, this wasn't that long after these
                        things. Was that sort of a burr under the saddle of at least our embassy and
                        consulate people in the Netherlands? You don't like to be demonstrated
                        against when the police don't give you adequate protection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I think there were two phases and maybe the one you're referring to
                    happened later. The first phase was the Vietnam phase. In Amsterdam, typically,
                    the crowd would go to the Vondel Park and the Museum Pein, and try to get at our
                    consulate. The nasty demonstrations came later, when Jerry Bremer was
                    ambassador. Jerry later told me that he put the choice to the Dutch foreign
                    ministry. He told him, “Either you give us good protection or we close the
                    place.” That was more than the Dutch government was willing to stomach, so they
                    provided better protection. Now, the place is surrounded by a huge fence which
                    is an eyesore and is not viewed kindly because it doesn't really fit the
                    surroundings. However, when the point was made to me the other week by a Dutch
                    acquaintance, I said, “It's too bad. If you don't control your crowds, we can't
                    sit there and let some of our Dutch employees be the target of mob fury.” So,
                    the Dutch don't like to be too tough on demonstrators. They never have been.
                    They have never been tough on drug users. They just don't like to be tough on
                    anyone or anything. Some Dutch are now beginning to rebel against this set of
                    attitudes. The politician Pim Fortuijn, who ran for office just this last summer
                    and was murdered just before his party got 23 percent of the vote, had been
                    taking the line that it's time to call a spade a spade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there splits in the Dutch body politic that concerned
                        us during the time you were there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Let me mention two issues. One had to do with reprocessing nuclear
                    fuel, an esoteric subject. The government had the greatest difficulty with the
                    notion that Dutch plants in the eastern part of the country would engage in
                    reprocessing material which, when returned to its sources - mainly the countries
                    and the plants that were providing this spent fuel for reprocessing - might be
                    used for nuclear weapons. Reprocessing of spent Brazilian fuel caused an immense
                    raucous in parliament. Particularly on the left side of the political spectrum,
                    the feeling was that the Dutch shouldn't be involved in this sort of thing.
                    Elsewhere in the political spectrum, it was pointed out that this was a major
                    industry that brought considerable revenue and could be handled well by the
                    Dutch under appropriate safeguards and should therefore be something the Dutch
                    ought to do. I was obliged to get an education, the second time in my life, into
                    the nuclear reprocessing cycle. It also forced the foreign minister, van der
                    Klauw, a former diplomat, also to learn this lesson. Unfortunately for him, he
                    never seemed to do the amount of homework on these esoteric things that was
                    required if he were to look good in parliament. So van der Klauw ran into
                    difficulties in parliament because he was not on top of his brief. Eventually,
                    he had a short tenure in that position. The experiment of a foreign service
                    officer as foreign minister was the last time the Dutch did it, until recently.
                    The issue also involved us, also because the United States has nuclear weapons.
                    We had our own reprocessing facilities. This was the time the nuclear
                    non-proliferation treaty (NPT) was in force. We had our ideas about nuclear
                    non-proliferation. The Dutch struggle to find their way through this issue was
                    of considerable interest to us. But it was something that we could watch only
                    from the sidelines.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The U.S. view of the European Community (EC, as it was called at the
                    time) was positive. It was regarded as a good thing, as structure to which we
                    contributed building blocks in the form of the Marshall Plan. In 1975, it
                    functioned as a common market. There was an incipient attempt to coordinate
                    positions on foreign policy issues. There was no talk of a common EU foreign
                    policy, but the EU chairmanship country did have the job of putting together the
                    agenda for monthly meetings of the EU representatives - the level lower than the
                    foreign ministers - where positions on issues such as Cyprus or apartheid or
                    whatever else on the fringe of Europe might be discussed. Thus, EU countries
                    could arrive at a common view which, in turn, might be reflected at the General
                    Assembly in New York, where an EC country would speak for them all. It was a
                    process in which we had a role, and a significant one. The agreed operating
                    procedure required that the chairmanship country would furnish to Washington the
                    agenda of the next meeting and allow input. I remember an event when Bob
                    McCloskey was our ambassador. The Dutch were in the EU chair. We got the agenda;
                    we sent it into Washington. But we didn't get any guidance. The meeting was
                    going to be over the weekend. Friday afternoon, there was no guidance. Saturday
                    morning, there was no guidance. The meeting had started and we had provided no
                    input. The Dutch called us and said, “Do you have any input?” We responded “No.”
                    Bob was livid. He sent in a rocket to the Department. The punch line of the
                    message was that it was undignified for an American ambassador to be left in a
                    position where he had no guidance. By Sunday, the meeting came to an end. Sunday
                    passed in silence. OMonday, there were two cables. One said, “When I gave you
                    liberty, I did not promise you dignity,” signed “Kissinger.” Of course, Bob had
                    been Kissinger's press spokesman. The second one was from Assistant Secretary
                    Art Hartman. It said, “Bob, you must be kidding.” It caused a good laugh on the
                    part of McCloskey and all of us. He never complained again. But it illustrates
                    that at that time in the mid-'70s, the EC attempt to begin coordinating foreign
                    policy was open to us and that we were invited and our views were considered. It
                    was, in a way, a golden age of consultation, with few rules, but when our
                    importance was recognized and our voice mattered.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Holland was probably the country in Europe that understood moralism
                    better than anyone else. The Dutch themselves are prone to take moralistic
                    positions. The political discourse is a constant mix of those factors. So that
                    sounded quite familiar. The Carter approach may at times have led to some raised
                    eyebrows in the ministry of foreign affairs, but Carter was not viewed
                    critically as he was in Germany, for instance.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: But that never particularly hurt the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Going back to the nuclear issue, I want to mention two events. One that caused a
                    lot of problems was our request for a port visit for the USS California to the
                    port of Rotterdam. California is a nuclear-powered cruiser. It may or may not
                    carry any nuclear weapons. In any event, getting permission for the cruiser to
                    come all the way into Rotterdam took forever, and we exercised polite pressure
                    of all sorts. I must have been in the foreign ministry a dozen times to argue
                    for it. Eventually, we got permission, despite a mix of environmental concerns
                    and anti-nuclear feelings. It was a dicey thing to do for the government to say,
                    “Okay, Rotterdam is not on the coast. You get this big, visible ship all the way
                    up the Maas river, about 15 miles inland. Rotterdam harbor is the aorta of Dutch
                    commerce. The Dutch message to us was “We don't want anything to go wrong.” So,
                    finally, the California came into Rotterdam harbor, but on the way in, its
                    engines encountered trouble. I remember that phone call and it was not good
                    news. But what was the problem? The ship was using river water for its cooling
                    system - and quality of the water of the port of Rotterdam was so bad that it
                    was fouling up the cooling system of the California. So we had the reverse of
                    what the Dutch had feared - the river polluted the ship and not the other way
                    around. In any event, the ship came in. It got a certain amount of publicity. I
                    took a couple of colleagues from the foreign ministry for lunch aboard.
                    Afterwards, the DCM's car swayed so badly on the Belgian cobblestones on the
                    pier that all of a sudden the engine caught behind one of these cobblestones and
                    we were brought to a prompt halt, sending me through the front windshield and my
                    guests from the back to the front seat. So, having just left the California,
                    where we had had lunch, I found myself back in the sick bay of the California,
                    having many pieces of glass pulled out of my forehead. I also had the
                    unfortunate distinction of having totaled the DCM's car. Luckily, I wasn't the
                    driver, but that was the end of Elizabeth Brown's official car.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, as often happens, you still had almost

                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That question gives me the chance not only to answer that but to get
                    into another major theme of my three years at the American Embassy at The Hague.
                    Sure, language had changed. In fact, the official spelling by law had changed
                    somewhat so that a lot of “sch's” became just “s's.” But the way in which you
                    said things was different, just as you find that to be the case here in the
                    United States. A typical salutation here is, “Take care.” Twenty years ago,
                    nobody would have known what that meant. And so, in 1975, the Dutch spoke a
                    language full of those expressions that I had to reacquaint myself with. But
                    that process went pretty fast because I still read and spoke it at the 5/5
                    level. When you're political counselor, you have every reason to look at the
                    press and look at television and talk with people all the time, so that was a
                    matter of very rapid acclimatization. I had been back in Holland a few times,
                    mostly a couple of days, sometimes as much as 3-5 days. But basically all my
                    other time in Europe had been elsewhere, in school in Paris, and in Germany. But
                    I can't say that those very quick visits made much difference in my ability to
                    handle the language. But I adjusted fairly well.</p>
                <p>What was a challenge was to try and explain to myself, and then to Washington,
                    the ways the country was different from the country that I had left. This was
                    the first major test of my ability to deal with the question of societal change.
                    In ThHague I was in a position where I saw a country that was obviously very
                    different from what I had left. I had to explain what had happened, why it had
                    happened, and what were the implications. Of course, you see change all around
                    you. You see it in your family, in where you live, and so forth. Much of the
                    time, you don't pay attention to it. But when you deal with estimative analysis,
                    as I did later on, you have to ask yourself what are the patterns of change,
                    what are the trends, and what do they mean? The Hague provided my first frontal
                    encounter with major societal change.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>What was the change? The Netherlands that I had left - and probably what I say is
                    true generally of Europe, but I certainly saw it through the Dutch prism - was a
                    country with a fairly long history in which the regents governed and the people
                    accepted their governance passively on the assumption that the regents knew what
                    they were doing. They deserved and got respect. The regents, moreover, were few.
                    The university population in the Netherlands before the war and right after it
                    was only a small percentage of the population. Big business was also a very
                    small percentage of the population. Therefore, the clan that ran Holland was
                    identifiable, small, and interconnected. You knew not only the people, you knew
                    who they were married to, you knew the family relationships. That was the
                    accepted order of things. All sorts of societal patterns that went with it,
                    including in the Netherlands the social phenomenon of so-called “zuilen” or
                    pillars, and the system of student clubs at the main universities. Since the war
                    against Spain in the 16th century, there had been a protestant pillar and a
                    catholic pillar. The two never interfaced. In 1975, when I returned, there was
                    also a social democratic pillar and a liberal pillar. So, Dutch society was a
                    bunch of stovepipes. You would find a situation in a particular town in which,
                    if you were Dutch reformed, so would be your baker, your clothier, your milkman,
                    the club you belonged to. You didn't go outside of that stovepipe for anything.
                    You watched the other stovepipes and at a certain point in politics in The Hague
                    these stovepipes came together in some carefully balanced way, and constituted
                    the government that governed the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>When I returned to the Netherlands the population was larger. The university
                    population had expanded exponentially. The regents had lost authority. Everybody
                    wanted what they called “inspraak,” which means they wanted an opportunity to
                    have their say. And the people who wanted to have the most say were the ones who
                    were on government salaries, particularly at universities. They had few fixed
                    hours, so they could go to meetings all night and outstay the people who had to
                    leave and go to bed. That left them alone to vote through their particular hobby
                    horses. This led to situations, such as in Rotterdam, when governance of the
                    University of Rotterdam was in the hands of equal groups of teachers, students,
                    and non-academic employees. The janitors had a vote on how the university was
                    running, including university appointments. This was an unheard of situation.
                    The social rebellion had started in Amsterdam in the sixties. At first, it
                    consisted of innocent manifestation, such as by the so-called “kabouters,” the
                    dwarfs, who did funny things, wore funny costumes, had exotic ideas like “Let's
                    solve our transportation problem by having 10,000 white bicycles all over town
                    and when you need a bike you pick one up and you go to where you want and you
                    leave it again.” It didn't work. They were stolen. Societal change happened
                    gradually after the war. It started in '53 with the big floods, when several
                    thousand people drowned, many of them through perceived incompetence of the
                    authorities who were looking after the dykes. It turned out they had their jobs
                    because they belonged to certain pillars in society, not because of their
                    competence. That started the erosion of respect for authority. Not to make too
                    long a story of this, I did seek advice from political scientists at Leiden,
                    some of whom are now in California, Arend Lijphard in particular. There was also
                    an academic by the name of Daalder, whose son, Ivo, is now on the news because
                    he's at Brookings and he was in the NSC in the Clinton administration. I also
                    went with the ambassador to see the cardinal iUtrecht. He helped me understand
                    best how to think about the process. He said, “You have to think of this process
                    as a molecule, consisting of atoms and electrons. They all are in relation to
                    each other. They're subject to outside forces, but they hang together. But the
                    outside forces increase. Still, the molecules hang together. Eventually,
                    however, those outside forces are so huge that the molecule breaks. Then
                    everything flies off in different directions. The electrons spin off. The atom
                    splits. And they all take on a new form, and that is the new pattern that you
                    have.” That was an image that I kept. I committed all of these impressions and
                    analysis to a very long airgram, as my effort to explain to myself and everybody
                    at home what the nature of Dutch society was. Back in Washington, most people
                    were living with the myth of the Dutchman with the finger in the dyke and the
                    wooden shoes. That was nice but not reflecting reality. Kingdon Gould read the
                    airgram with visible reservation. But he signed it, with the comment that this
                    might be the first case in recorded history of an ambassador going in through
                    the dissent channel. But I had the backing of Elizabeth Ann Brown, the DCM, and
                    many others on the staff of the embassy. It took six months to put that airgram
                    together. It was like a small term paper. Ever since, I have applied the lessons
                    learned in that exercise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That was true right after the war, from '46 to maybe '55. Those were
                    years when conditions were still not good and the temptation to leave was
                    strong. After that, things improved. The Netherlands is an extremely prosperous
                    country with a high degree of well-being. In the seventies, the emigration
                    pattern was much weaker than it had been earlier. Most of the Dutch who had
                    emigrated were farmers who felt they were running out of farmland and they could
                    go to Canada or Australia and resume their careers there as farmers. The outflow
                    of Dutch to other places was not significant. There were no long lines in front
                    of the consulates for the visas. We didn't issue visas in The Hague, so there
                    were no lines. But I know that was not the case in Rotterdam or Amsterdam. No,
                    not a push to leave in those days and not afterwards either.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of the royals? Was there any role
                        really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. The House of Orange played and still plays an important part in
                    Dutch life. In my time in The Hague, it was Queen Juliana and her husband,
                    Prince Bernhard. She was universally loved. He was appreciated. Some of his
                    capers, some of them extramarital, were known, but they didn't much affect
                    people's views of him. He was implicated in those years in something called the
                    Lockheed scandal. It was a question whether he had been more active than he
                    ought to have been in getting the Dutch government to procure aircraft from
                    LockheeHe probably did more than he should have but in the event it only led to
                    a government decision that he would no longer be allowed to wear his air force
                    uniform. The queen had a constitutional role and still does today. She selects
                    the person who, after an election, puts together the next cabinet, and then
                    appoints the prime minister. While there are certain rules that would be hard to
                    violate and get away with, that is her decision. She is the key figure who
                    consults with all the parties after an election. In between elections, she has
                    the opportunity to keep informed on all issues of state. Other than that, the
                    queen or the king is a figurehead, whose many social and representational duties
                    are, generally, deeply appreciated at all levels of Dutch society. While the
                    Dutch instinct about the nature of their country is republican, they feel good
                    about the House of Orange. I speculated at the time with one of the journalists
                    who was an expert on the royals about how this would go in the future. Our
                    conclusion was that then princess Beatrix would have to earn that same respect
                    that her mother and her grandmother had had, that this would not come
                    automatically. I left that as a question. Now we know that Beatrix, in her own
                    systematic, rigorous way, earned deep respect, being a hard worker and by
                    immersing herself in her briefings. At times, she has exercised prerogatives
                    that have raised eyebrows, like questioning whether an ambassador who had just
                    divorced and was living with somebody was a suitable ambassador in a country to
                    which he was about to pay a state visit, and by raising the question with the
                    prime minister whether the ambassador shouldn't be replaced. That caused a howl
                    because that was not seen to be her function or role. There are probably a
                    number of other stories that can be told along this line; Beatrix has tended to
                    push the envelope in that respect. Now the question is, of course, what will her
                    son, who has just last year married a young Argentine woman, manage to earn his
                    respect. But there are no indications that the House of Orange is in danger.
                    There are a lot of princes now, and a lot of members of the family, and when you
                    have a large family some of them are bound to get into trouble. The boulevard
                    press will pick that up very happily. And in my time I heard stories about some
                    of the younger members of the royal family who tended to assume prerogatives
                    that weren't really there. The royal household handled those issues with
                    delicacy and skill. I came away with respect for Juliana. Beatrix was not on the
                    political scene yet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Let me back up for one anecdote on Juliana. Once a year the
                    diplomatic corps troops to the palace in Amsterdam for the New Year's reception.
                    The rule was that the ambassadors could bring five members of the staff. We
                    would all enter the main gate of the palace and be assigned to pens in order of
                    precedence. And in order of precedence each national group were ushered in. The
                    ambassador would be greeted by the queen, and shake hands. He would then
                    introduce the staff. The queen would say a few things. And then we would proceed
                    out and the next ambassador and his group would come in. When we went out,
                    ambassadors went one way and the staff were sent the other way. Ambassadors were
                    given champagne. We got pea soup. This was a typical Dutch dish. Particularly in
                    January, it could be a warm antidote to the cold outside. But pea soup was not
                    champagne. It triggered amused comment about the proverbial frugality of the
                    House of Orange. The queen was not going to spend any more on these events than
                    she absolutely had to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find relations with Germany during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: They were still uneasy. A considerable residue of sentiment remained
                    anti-German. That exhibited itself in childish stuff, such as putting graffiti
                    on German cars at the sea resorts. A few people on principle didn't want to go
                    to Germany. But the Dutch business world knew that they were part of the German
                    DM area, that most of their business was with Germany, and that the port of
                    Rotterdam was the port through which German goods came out and goods headed for
                    Germany came in. The Dutch made money on that. In that respect, relations were
                    pretty normal. The reconciliation between the Netherlands and Germany did not
                    come until many years later, when Chancellor Kohl was persuaded by Prime
                    Minister Kok in the early '90s to visit Rotterdam, following a poll - which
                    upset both the Germans and the Dutch governments - which showed that there was
                    still a lot of resentment in the Netherlands. Kok persuaded Kohl, who was not
                    easy to persuade on these matters, that he ought to come. But Kohl came, laid a
                    wreath, and said the appropriate things. That was sort of the formal end of the
                    World War II. Meanwhile, the Germans had done a magnificent job in sending
                    outstanding ambassadors to The Hague. I knew two of them personally. They
                    learned Dutch fluently and they worked very hard to improve relations. I think
                    that helped a great deal in smoothing the relationship and eventually making the
                    Kohl visit the success that it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Battle of Arnhem? Was that an annual

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The annual celebration in those days was still the 8th of May, which
                    was the date of the liberation in 1945. It was marked by processions to the
                    spots where Dutchmen had been executed; it was a sober type of commemoration.
                    This practice is now losing force, although I'm sure that the commemoration
                    continues. The Battle of Arnhem, I don't think, is commemorated in any
                    particular way, unless by the locality.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It might be, but it would be very small. One of the particular things
                    that I remember was that as a child I had seen those planes and gliders come
                    over in September 1944. They landed 35 miles from where I was living in Utrecht.
                    I couldn't see them come down but I saw them come over. There was no
                    antiaircraft and no German Luftwaffe to keep them from doing so. It was a huge
                    fleet. It was spectacular and we didn't know where they were going, but they
                    were low enough so we knew something was happening close by. In '77, when the
                    ambassador and the DCM were prevented by their schedules from doing so, it fell
                    to me to represent the United States at the opening of the Arnhem Battle Museum
                    in the castle named Hartestein. This was where General Urquhart and the 1st
                    British Airborne made their last stand. I found myself with a Polish general,
                    and many Dutch authorities. There were also many British. General Urquhart
                    himself turned up for the event. He was in his 80s. The British flew a Dakota
                    over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Out jumped two parachutists in uniform. They landed on the front
                    lawn. We were deployed on the steps in front. The lead parachutists undid his
                    parachute, walked up to General Urquhart, saluted, and handed him the key to the
                    building. General Urquhart then opened the building and we all went in and
                    signed the book. What General Urquhart said in his speech about the surrender
                    was, “In the end, it wasn't the gerries. It was the lack of water.” So the
                    British forces ran out of water and they surrendered. For all of us who hoped
                    for success, it was a huge disappointment.</p>

                    Embassy as the deputy two in the political section. I was number two for one
                    year and then I succeeded Dick Smyser for another two years as political
                    counselor.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. And all that time, except for the last few months, my ambassador
                    was Walter Stoessel, a prince of a man whom I came to respect enormously. In the
                    spring of 1981, Arthur Burns succeeded Stoessel, and I accompanied him with
                    others when he presented his credentials. I overlapped with Mr. Burns for only
                    two months.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was one of the most raucous of many issues that we dealt with at
                    the time. In the end, we got the support of Chancellor Schmidt and the Social
                    Democratic Party, under Schmidt's leadership. But it did cost him his job and it
                    led to a new government with Kohl. I'm not saying that the issue led directly to
                    his outcome, but since this issue roiled public opinion more than any other,
                    there was some sort of causal relationship. Perhaps Schmidt was at the end of
                    his domestic political tether anyway. But we did get full support from Schmidt,
                    who was not an easy man to talk to or persuade. The German government came
                    through on this in an important way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the American-German relationship when

                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Going from The Hague to Bonn entailed a radical shifting of gears on
                    my part. A little over a hundred miles is not a great distance, but the
                    difference between the political worlds of The Hague and Bonn were vast. The
                    optic in The Hague was narrow, somewhat inward looking. You could discuss till
                    the cows came home the ins and outs of Dutch politics. Bonn brought me back to
                    major issues of Europe on peace and security. From The Hague, the Soviet Union
                    was light years away. In Bonn, the Soviet Union was almost in your living room.
                    In Bonn, you were thinking about divided Germany, about European peace and
                    security, and about how to deal with Soviet communism in Germany and beyond.
                    Bonn was a wholly different setting and required a wholly different way of
                    thinking. The American role in Germany and the American equities in Germany were
                    comparable to the ones that I was familiar with in the Netherlands, though on a
                    different scale. Most of the U.S. forces in Europe were stationed in Germany. We
                    had to worry about Berlin. We needed to keep a close eye on whether the German
                    SPD would continue on the track of full support of the Atlantic alliance and
                    partnership with the U.S. - although at the time partnership was not the word -
                    or whether the latent tendency represented by certain people in the SPD to
                    strike a deal with the East and neutralize Germany in exchange for reunification
                    would gain the upper hand. It was not in our interest to see such an evolution.
                    Later on, Dick Smyser and I spent a good bit of our time as political counselors
                    watching carefully for indications that perhaps German policy might again go in
                    a fundamentally different direction from the one that we had come to expect and
                    rely on. Such a turn of policy was an option at the end of the war, until
                    Adenauer made the choice between being neutral in the middle or being part of
                    the West. That was the strategic backdrop against which virtually all our
                    activities in Bonn, certainly mine, were taking place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The introduction of the SS20 was really designed to foster
                        getting Germany to say “Let's stop being a target and get out of the whole

                        pressure was put?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The SS20 issue brought to life again the old argument as to where
                    Germany ought to be. We could anticipate that the Germans would do the right
                    thing, but you could not be sure about that. So, whenever Egan Bahr, a foreign
                    policy adviser to Brandt-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of a Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, he was Kissingerian in the sense that he was a realpolitiker
                    and he understood how Germany might get what it wanted for itself in terms of
                    dealing with this giant of the East, and also somehow with the Western powers,
                    and the United States in particular. But the issue of the basic orientation of
                    Germany was not seen in the same way by all Germans. On the side of the
                    Christian Democrats, who were not in power at the time that I was in Bonn, there
                    would have been little danger of Germany sliding away from the Western alliance.
                    The combination of the Free Democrats and the Social Democrats looked reasonably
                    sure. Certainly, with a man like Genscher from the Free Democrats as foreign
                    minister, there seemed to be little danger of Germany going “neutral.” But with
                    people like Bahr around, you could never be sure who was whispering what into
                    whose ear. I don't think Bahr had much influence on Schmidt. But he had a
                    considerable influence on Brandt. Brandt was still alive. He had won a Nobel
                    Peace Prize. These people had influence. They had their own contacts with the
                    Soviets, the ability to make things happen. So, there were a lot of balls to
                    keep your eye on in our embassy. Besides this and the nuclear defense issues, we
                    were coping with the issue of the conditions under which U.S. forces were
                    stationed in Germany. We felt that they needed better conditions, better
                    barracks. The German barracks were better then ours. We were looking to the
                    Germans for a large amount of the money to sustain our forces. I was personally
                    saddled with a lot of those issues that involved difficult negotiations with the
                    Defense Department and the German defense ministry, as well as with German
                    politicians. Klaus von Dohnanyi, an SPD politician, had been put in charge of
                    this whole issue by the chancellor's office. His people were not always very
                    helpful. They needed to interface with the Bundestag. In the end, it didn't
                    matter that much, but at the time this was a big ticket item and it was a big
                    money ticket item.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the political developments between the
                        U.S. and Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We faced the issue of Afghanistan. The Soviets had invaded
                    Afghanistan. The Carter administration's reaction, among other things, was to
                    take the United States out of the Olympics scheduled for Moscow. We campaigned
                    to persuade our friends to do likewise. We leaned heavily on the Germans to stay
                    out of Moscow. We also leaned heavily on virtually everybody else. We were only
                    partially successful. But it caused a gnashing of teeth that the U.S. was
                    politicizing the Olympics. Our stock answer was that it wasn't we who started
                    politicizing it; if the Soviets had behaved themselves this problem would not
                    exist. It was an unsatisfactory discussion. In the end, the American position,
                    while I'm sure morally correct in the view of many, was not a very useful one as
                    a matter of practical politics. It led to disappointment on the part of a great
                    many athletes who had hoped to compete and, because of the inevitable passage of
                    time, before the next Olympics, saw their last chance disappear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Germans fall on this? Did they go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: They did not. Schmidt felt that Germany had to support its American
                    ally. This was a tough decision, because the British and French sent their
                    athletes to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Germany beginning to assert itself within the European
                        Community? Did you sense a change in Germany as far as here is this big
                        power which has been keeping quite quiet over the years? Did you see a
                        development there of beginning to play a bigger role on the world's stage?
                        Those are things that we might pick up next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is March 14, 2003. We laid out a few things that you might want to comment
                    on.</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I've had a chance to collect my memory in a somewhat more organized
                    fashion. First, a personal observation about coming to the job in Bonn. At that
                    point, it was clear to me that Germany had moved a long way, from the position
                    of a defeated power, as I saw it from my vantage point in Berlin in the
                    mid-'60s, to a major European country that was playing a growing role inside
                    Europe and was beginning to make itself felt. The change was personified in the
                    personality of Chancellor Schmidt, a knowledgeable, articulate, proud, and at
                    times acerbic man who did not tolerate fools gladly and who, though he spoke
                    perfect English, made it a habit of speaking to his visitors in German, which
                    caused no problem for Ambassador Stoessel or those of us who were there around
                    him. But I recall one day where the then relatively junior Senator Biden came to
                    call and insisted on an appointment, and Schmidt played hard to get because he
                    was chancellor and this was just one of many senators. When Biden did get the
                    appointment there had to be an interpreter because Schmidt used German.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Before we get into details, I want to sketch the setting for the exercise of my
                    job as political counselor. In 1978, there had been under way, for a decade or
                    more, a process of detente, not just between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This
                    rapprochement was set in motion by the American University speech of Kennedy in
                    1963. The governing mayor of Berlin, Willy Brandt, was also focused on improving
                    relations. So we were at the beginning of some sort of coming together, in spite
                    of the division of Germany. In the decade that followed, German attempts -
                    particularly with mostly West German initiatives - to straddle the divide and
                    pick up contacts and start to try and repair, despite the division, the fabric
                    of relationships were well under way. The detente process took place both on a
                    global scale as well as an inter-German scale. Washington officially favored the
                    inter-German discourse, but at the same time it was mistrustful that perhaps too
                    much might be given away. The process also was not entirely transparent to us.
                    So a considerable amount of activity and interest on our part was directed at
                    being sure that we knew, if not all the details, then at least the main lines of
                    what the West Germans were up to with the East Germans, and what the West
                    Germans were up to with Moscow. This process of detente when I arrived in Bonn
                    in '78 was actually about to run its course. It was coming to an end because of
                    the Soviet plan to deploy SS20s, which would change the nuclear balance of power
                    within Europe that deeply concerned Schmidt.</p>
                <p>The Carter administration was slow in picking up this change in German attitude.
                    The Carter administration, in fact, was somewhat bifurcated. Secretary Vance was
                    in favor of detente and easier relations with the Soviet Union. The national
                    security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was mistrustful of the Soviet Union and
                    he was not initially a friend of detente. He saw its downside. And his
                    suspicions of anything that the Germans and the Russians might do were greater.
                    These two views, existing within the administration, posed a problem for
                    Schmidt. In the event, not getting much of a hearing in official Washington,
                    Schmidt went public with his concerns in a speech in the middle of the Carter
                    administration. From then on, the issue also became one for the Carter White
                    House, namely, how to respond to this new threat by the Soviets. I might say,
                    parenthetically, that it seemed that at the time even the Soviets had several
                    views. Brezhnev was probably softer on Germany and on U.S. relations than
                    Gromyko, who had been a hardliner throughout. But at that point Brezhnev was
                    physically and in other respects close to the end of his tenure, so we were
                    dealing with Moscow that was speaking several voices and presenting different
                    faces. Be that as it may, the SS20 issue was a difficult one. It brought into
                    play the desire of those who were still interested in detente, both in
                    Washington and in Bonn, against those who thought that this was upsetting the
                    balance of power and needed a response. Ultimately, the NATO alliance managed
                    with U.S. leadership and the participation of the Netherlands, Italy, Germany,
                    and Britain, to adopt a plan for the stationing of Pershings and GLCMs, which
                    were cruise missiles with a shorter range which could put Moscow at risk. That
                    in turn scared the Russians and that in turn led - way beyond my time in Bonn -
                    to the deal that eliminated the Soviet threat. The SS20 issue was a difficult
                    one for Schmidt. In the end, it produced a lot of domestic opposition to this
                    decision on the part of his own party and the Greens, who were growing at the
                    time. Ultimately, it was one of the reasons that led to his unseating by Helmut
                    Kohl.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Germany when the SS20s were introduced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The SS20s were introduced on the other side by the Russians and they
                    were being deployed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was seen from our embassy in Bonn and throughout Europe
                        as, this was a change in the whole thing. As soon as the SS20s were
                        introduced, was this portrayed by the Soviets and others as changing the
                        balance of power in Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was more of a gradual process. There is still speculation on what
                    might have been the Soviet motives. It may have had less to do with specific
                    policy with respect to the balance with Germany. It might have been viewed by
                    them as just a regular weapons upgrade. It might have been seen by them as a
                    general beefing up of the nuclear part of their forces. Whatever it was, the
                    arrival of these weapons threatened to change the strategic balance within
                    Europe. The global balance of power of course had already changed somewhat and
                    everybody had got used to it. The Soviets had a major intercontinental nuclear
                    capacity, as did we. Of course, on the ground the Soviets had huge superiority
                    in conventional forces. Western strategy was that our nuclear forces would
                    offset that conventional superiority and produce certain balance. But when the
                    Soviets started introducing nuclear weapons that pretty much could cover all of
                    Western Europe, and we did not have all that much in our arsenal in Europe to
                    respond; it was regarded as a change in the balance. The Schmidt speech at the
                    IISS triggered the debate on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the neutron bomb episode and Carter-Schmidt on
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The neutron bomb decision was another event that caused difficulties
                    between Carter and Schmidt. The idea of the bomb had been around for a while.
                    The wish of the U.S. Army to proceed with it became controversial after the
                    documents that treated this subject were leaked to the press. A number of
                    Europeans, including some Americans, also recoiled in horror at what some in
                    Europe called “the capitalist weapon,” because it killed people and did not
                    damage things. It was regarded by a lot of people as something basically
                    dangerous and unsettling, and so it was controversial. Schmidt put his political
                    equities on the line to support the Carter White House in favor of the neutron
                    bomb. So, when the President suddenly, and without warning, canceled the weapon,
                    Schmidt felt that he had been stabbed in the back. The episode confirmed his
                    view of Carter as an unreliable person. So, the relationship between those two
                    deteriorated further.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>There was another issue that was at play in those days. It involved the
                    Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Schmidt had had a hand in
                    establishing CSCE. Kissinger at the time had been unenthusiastic about it. But
                    the Carter administration acquired a quick appetite for using the human rights
                    provisions of CSCE as something to rub the Soviet noses into. Schmidt, wishing
                    to preserve both his equities with Moscow as well as with Washington, was more
                    cautious in using CSCE as a bludgeon against the Russians. So there was another
                    difference in approach between the two administrations.</p>
                <p>All in all, the wind down of detente with Moscow was capped in December of '79, a
                    couple of weeks after the double-track decision on the SS20s, by the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the double track?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The NATO decision had two elements. One was to station Pershings and
                    the GLCMs. The other track was a promise for diplomatic negotiations, to try to
                    negotiate a way both with respect to the SS20s and the western response to it.
                    It was that other track, the second track, that made the deployment decision
                    acceptable to the Europeans. The second track provided the outcome to this
                    entire episode. So we had the double-track decision. But then the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan drew a line under the detente witMoscow. Both Bonn and
                    Washington took strong positions, and there was a feeling that detente had run
                    its course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SS20 episode seemed to have been the last gasp of the
                        Soviet Union as far as organizing the Communist Party in Western Europe and
                        the peacelovers and all this into trying to use this mass opinion and
                        marches and protests to stop our responding to the SS20s. Then when the
                        invasion of Afghanistan came, that just cut the feet out from under the
                        peace movement. Did you see it that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. I think that's a fair portrayal of what went on. I might add
                    that in my opinion the impetus for the demonstrations in opposition to the
                    western response to the SS20s was not driven by a hidden Soviet hand. It was a
                    native German phenomenon. The Soviets did what they could to encourage it. But
                    they didn't have to, since much of the anti-nuclear sentiment was already
                    present in Germany and it was pretty strong. The Soviets saw domestic German
                    opposition as to their advantage. At that time, there was still a bifurcated
                    view in Moscow about this whole situation. Brezhnev was dubious; Gromyko was
                    hardline.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>So, on the SS20, on CSCE, on the neutron bomb, and then also eventually on the
                    way to react to the Afghan invasion, there were- (end of tape) differences
                    between the chancellery in Bonn and the Carter administration. The United States
                    very strongly urged a lot of countries, including Germany, not to send their
                    team to the Olympics. The Germans agreed to do that. The Germans never agreed to
                    the whole series of economic boycotts that we proposed and carried out
                    ourselves. In the end, Carter had little trust in Schmidt and Schmidt did not
                    think much of Carter. So, my three years in Bonn essentially took place in a
                    field of tension that affected the very top layers of government. The management
                    of the specific issues that I've just been talking about took a great deal of
                    time and attention at senior levels in the embassy. I was pretty closely
                    involved as political counselor in all of them. I should reiterate that we
                    operated against the backdrop of constant suspicion, particularly on the part of
                    some NSC officials, of what the Germans were up to. Whenever Schmidt verbalized
                    his views about Carter, they tended to be picked up by elements of the embassy
                    and reported without varnish up the line to their backstoppers in Washington.
                    This information would be fed straight to the NSC and the President. This did
                    not help matters. Whatever the ambassador and we could do to put things in a
                    better light was often a process of chasing our tails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem is that if you have a particularly pungent
                        expression on the part of a chief of state, that's so sexy, that it goes

                        context.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That was exactly our problem but the guts of the problem was that
                    there were real differences of view about the direction of policy and the way it
                    ought to be executed.</p>

                        relations” and working almost undercover to make sure that things didn't get

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: In the later part of my tenure, I had got to know well my opposite
                    numbers in the foreign ministry and the chancellery, but also a lot of the
                    political class, press, academia, and opinion makers. They were good
                    acquaintances and good sources. They also saw and understood the process that
                    was taking place. We saw our interests in the same terms. That is to say we had
                    to stick together. We were facing problems. It was a difficult matter of
                    deciding what the policy ought to be. But when it came to execution, it ought to
                    be possible to work together. So we spent a fair amount of time just throwing
                    oil on the troubled waters when we could. The role of the foreign minister,
                    Genscher, was not exactly that of a lily. He was a very active man. He had an
                    entire political party behind him, the Free Democrats. So he had his own
                    political standing. He was indefatigable, always traveling and making it his
                    business to improve relations and open doors and so forth. So, while we had
                    other reasons to be interested in and sometimes concerned about Mr. Genscher
                    because he had his own agenda that might not necessarily square with ours, the
                    motivation of that agenda was different from those in the left wing of the
                    Social Democratic Party, which basically wanted to continue the track that Willy
                    Brandt had started in Berlin. Some Social Democrats never let go, at least in
                    theory, of the option of a neutral Germany if unification could be purchased at
                    that price. So, we were constantly interested in what both groups did, and kept
                    a close eye on this situation by talking to friends, seeing politicians, talking
                    to diplomatic colleagues, reading the press, and by talking to these individuals
                    themselves. It's not that these were beyond our reach. My predecessor had
                    contacts with Bahr and with Wehner and with Brandt. I had occasion to observe
                    them all, too. I saw Genscher regularly in the company of others. From time to
                    time, I'd see the chancellor as well, again in the company of others. I talked
                    to their staffs a lot and I had a pretty good picture of what was going on. It
                    was a hand in glove operation. My interlocutors in the chancellery, both
                    diplomatic and military, were excellent contacts. That was not because of me. I
                    think it just came with the position because they, too, saw it very much in
                    their interest to maintain that sort of contact with an official American. I
                    should mention one particular contact among the many with German political
                    figures, with Richard von Weizsaecker. I picked up from my predecessor, Dick
                    Smyser, a pattern of occasional late-afternoon meetings, often in his house in
                    Bad Bodesberg. He was a distinguished leader and president at that time of the
                    German Kirchentag - a sort of large Christian organization that interested
                    itself also in political themes. We would sit in the garden and sip scotch. Von
                    Weizsaecker went on to become mayor of Berlin and president of his country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, was Genscher using the German foreign
                        service? Were they on the same track or was he proceeding on his own and the
                        German foreign service was being more German than Genscherites?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Genscher was foreign minister for such a long time that in the end it
                    was his foreign service. If you didn't agree with Genscher, you really had no
                    future in the German foreign service. There were other places you could go. You
                    could get out-of-office assignments. You might be assigned, as some of them
                    were, to the chancellery. But there were less bureaucratic devices available
                    than we have in Washington to park officials who either didn't fit or felt they
                    might not fit the prevailing mode. No, the foreign ministry was highly
                    responsive to Genscher. He drove them hard. He had tough work methods. He had
                    abominable personal work habits: Early morning, late night, constant travel,
                    heavy eating, a lot of smoking. I remember seeing him with Ambassador Stoessel
                    once and reporting - this was after he had been in the hospital with heart
                    surgery - that he looked bad. I speculated that, if he kept at the pace that I
                    was witnessing during that particular conversation, he wouldn't last very long.
                    I couldn't have been wronger. He was around Bonn much longer than me and he is
                    still alive today, although he no longer plays a role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How seriously did we consider? Did the Afghan invasion by
                        the Soviets sort of put to an end within Germany the idea of a neutral
                        Germany on the part of the left wing of the socialists at least for the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: I think the answer is no. Wehner and Bahr held a long view. They knew
                    that the Afghan caper, bad as it was and long though it eventually lasted, would
                    not last forever and that the German question was forever. So, I don't think
                    that really put a dent in their overall estimate of what the geostrategic
                    possibilities were for Germany. But, smart as they were, they did realize that
                    the invasion set back the possibility of making quick progress on detente or on
                    unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that the Afghan invasion might augur
                        something of the same nature within Europe or were we looking for heightened
                        signs of Soviet military activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Two things. One was that we had been watching the SS20 saga unfold,
                    and that was seen by the West as an intentional threat and a serious one. But
                    there was something else that was afoot at the end of my tenure, and that was
                    the Solidarity Movement in Poland. That showed heavy Soviet hands behind a tough
                    Polish government approach to the baby steps of Solidarity. This uncompromising
                    attitude led us to wonder for many months whether we would be seeing in Poland a
                    repeat oHungary and Czechoslovakia. There wasn't a great deal we could do about
                    it because it really depended on how the regime in Moscow saw its equities and
                    how dangerous the Soviets would feel these developments were. But the precedent
                    of Soviet military intervention was established, and none of us had any illusion
                    that it could not be repeated. So, we were also living under the threat that,
                    even as the SS20s were being introduced, Moscow would show an extremely heavy
                    hand in Poland. For American diplomacy, anything that would happen in Poland
                    would have created a much more acute dilemma than the Czech Republic or
                    Czechoslovakia had been, given the domestic element of our relationship with
                    Poland.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Soviet military action in Poland in 1978 or 1979 would have roiled
                    the strategic relationship between Washington and Moscow. Afghanistan was not
                    regarded as a direct threat by anybody in Europe. But the evolution of
                    Solidarity and the Soviet reaction and the play-out of the SS20 issue certainly
                    were.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The SS20 was high stakes poker both in terms of strategy as well as
                    domestic politics in Germany and in Europe, and it was a major challenge to
                    American diplomacy in Europe. There were heroes such as Mike Glitman, who backed
                    up Paul Nitze, who negotiated the end game to this and who were called upon not
                    just to do that but also to give a persuasive public face to an extremely
                    complex situation so as to get public support for the position.</p>

                        with which to beat the Soviets over the head?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: From my perspective, and that of my people in the political section
                    in Bonn, this was one of a number of negotiations that were ongoing for a very
                    long time. There were others. There was the whole SALT/START process that was
                    going on at the time. There were the MBFR negotiations in Vienna, eventually
                    heading into the Conventional Forces in Europe agreements later. There was the
                    CSCE negotiating process that Max Kampleman was heavily involved in. These were
                    long running shows. We monitored the cable traffic as these agreements were
                    negotiated, and we were privy to the considerations as to how we should use the
                    arms control system once it was in place. All of this was a very gradual process
                    and the lead usually came from those who dealt with it directly in Washington
                    and in the field, which often provided the lead to Washington. It was one of
                    those things that would typically be on the agenda for any major review of all
                    the issues with the Germans. On occasion, there might be an American from the
                    MBFR or the OSCE delegation coming in for bilateral discussions with the
                    Germans. Jack Dean, one of my predecessors in Bonn, and now head of our MBFR
                    delegation, came regularly. It tended to be on the agenda of the NATO ministers
                    every time they met. It was not something that we handled directly in Bonn. It
                    was not our job to consider how that might be used in more global relationships
                    but I think the sense that we had was that this was a good thing. Perhaps the
                    German view of this was always a little bit ahead of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the French-German alliance? Was this a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The French were among the four countries that took responsibility for
                    occupation zones in western Germany and occupation sectors in Berlin, with all
                    the rights that went with that status in those sectors. The headquarters of the
                    French 1st Army were in Baden- Baden. Our 5th and 7th Corps were headquartered
                    in Heidelberg and Munich. EUCOM was in Stuttgart. The British army on the Rhine
                    was headquartered at Munchen-Gladbach. We worked with the French both in Berlin
                    in the allied Kommandatura and in the so-called Bonn Group in Bonn. On occasion
                    the Four Powers together dealt with all of Germany. This happened in the German
                    treaties of the early '70s which relaxed the regime in Berlin somewhat. Our
                    negotiator was Kenneth Rush. Their position in Germany gave the French leverage,
                    and they participated in all considerations of the Bonn Group. In the Bonn Group
                    section of the political section of the embassy a couple of officers were doing
                    nothing buBerlin. Though the French were equal participants in the Bonn Group,
                    they did not necessarily pull equal weight. In those days, we did not think much
                    about the Germany-France relationship because that concept had not evolved yet
                    between those countries. Schmidt and Giscard could get along easily, and did so
                    in English. But it was still a situation of unequals. The French occupied part
                    of Berlin, and the French military were present in part of Germany. France had a
                    permanent seat on the Security Council with veto rights. Germany had none of
                    these attributes. But at that time Germany had no pretensions yet to have a
                    profile in terms of European policy. Germany was focused on itself, in
                    particular on improving the situation of Germans on the other side of the iron
                    curtain line, through a policy of Kleine Schritte of Brandt, a policy of “small
                    steps.” Bonn was occupied with the potential of Soviet power to derail this
                    entire process. Bonn was also preoccupied with the importance of keeping the
                    United States in Europe. So Bonn was quite prepared to take the American lead on
                    all sorts of issues in order to maximize its objectives. France provided little
                    by way of security, guarantees, money, or openings for German policy at that
                    time. I don't want to belittle the French, but at that time we were not talking
                    about a Germany-France relationship the way we do today.</p>

                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Berlin had become a very different place. The mood in the '60s, when
                    we felt and acted as occupiers, had been replaced by a mood in which we
                    Americans saw ourselves as facilitators to help the Germans in that city do what
                    they wanted to do. The funding was German. Military security was principally
                    provided by us. Increasingly, we exercised the powers that we legally had in a
                    more and more restricted way. Formally speaking, things didn't change. In
                    reality, they did. Formally, we still controlled the Berlin police force. The
                    reality was that we were increasingly inclined to let them make their own
                    decisions. We did maintain the Spandau function right until the end. The German
                    government also was not involved in the function of the quadripartite Berlin Air
                    Safety Center, where the allies dealt with the Soviets on the flight safety of
                    each flight to and from Berlin. Berlin was also increasingly becoming of age. It
                    was reviving economically. It was seen as a city with a future. Young people
                    were no longer leaving; they were coming back. It had always been the capital,
                    but it was not the seat of government. That issue was decided years later. But
                    Berlin as a city was coming back.</p>
                <p>I did have occasion to go to Berlin. Of course, I went to other parts of Germany
                    as well as part of my job. But I had special reasons for a while to go to Berlin
                    because I fell into a job that was regarded as sensitive and so few people knew
                    about it. It involved the prisoner exchanges. For a long time the United States
                    had maintained a channel, both with Moscow and the East Germans, through which
                    we were able to make deals involving the exchange of people. Some of these
                    people were famous, like Sharansky. Many of them were nameless. The West Germans
                    had their own fairly elaborate system of buying out people from the East. But we
                    had our own equities. Often they were Germans who had been working for us and
                    who ended up in custody and whom we were interested in getting back. The East
                    Germans, of course, had occasional interest in some of their people who were in
                    the West. So there were negotiating points that existed to facilitate this
                    running negotiation. For two years I was the American prisoner exchange
                    negotiating point. It required a number of visits to East Berlin and occasional
                    meetings in West Germany.</p>
                <p>Q: How did these things work out? You'd come up and say, “Okay, you've got this
                    in your stable. We've got these in ours?” Was it a horse trade?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It depended on a lot of factors, many of them extraneous to the
                    individuals involved. My interlocutor was an East German civilian named Wolfgang
                    Vogel. He had no official position in East Germany. He was an attorney with a
                    law practice. But he was a confidant of Honecker and he was allowed to do things
                    that no other East German was allowed to do, like driving a Mercedes and going
                    to the West whenever he wanted to and using hard currency. We knew that he spoke
                    for the regime. Of course, Vogel knew that his American interlocutor spoke for
                    the United States. So everybody knew exactly with whom he was dealing. But
                    unlike a typical negotiation between states, which involves office buildings and
                    press attention, there was none of that. This was all pretty much hidden from
                    view. It was even hidden from view of my colleagues in the embassy.</p>

                    made a deal that would have involved the transfer of money. During my time, I
                    don't think I had a great deal of luck getting people released. These things
                    went up and down. But the discussions continued. Once every three or four
                    months, or more frequently sometimes, it was not always in East Berlin.
                    Sometimes Vogel would come west and I would meet him in the west. They had very
                    specific interests in people and they certainly were willing to trade. It was a
                    very carefully orchestrated dance on the part of these negotiators around some
                    very fundamental principles of “You can give me what I want and I can give you
                    what you want.” But just how that worked out and which particular person the
                    regime would see fit to let go, sometimes with the publicity of that person then
                    turning up on the other side, depended very much on the political circumstances
                    of the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the West German side was just riddled
                        with agents. You might negotiate something but by the next day two more
                        would have been picked up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The discussion that I was part of was not part of the inter-German
                    exchange process, which was mostly money one way and people the other. The West
                    Germans were aware that we were engaged with the East Germans. But to a large
                    degree what my predecessors and I and my successors were doing was not briefed
                    to the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there the SS20s and other things were
                        happening but Berlin was not being used as a way of ratcheting up
                        tension?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: No, but the geographic position of Berlin continued to make it
                    vulnerable. We were still in the situation in which any physical move by the
                    Soviets against Berlin would have triggered major consequences. The anticipation
                    that this would happen was less high than it had been earlier, when Khrushchev
                    made his threats. In the time I was posted there in the '60s, I went through
                    some miniblockades. But the reality was that Berlin remained a hostage and a
                    touchstone of East-West relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover on your Bonn

                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I have a couple of things that I should like to mention. One is that
                    I spent a good deal of time with the political/military section on the issue of
                    the conditions in which the U.S. forces lived in Germany at the time. The
                    Germans, being systematic and relatively well funded, were providing excellent
                    new barracks for their forces. We typically used World War II facilities that
                    had been cobbled together and were kept together by continued cobbling. There
                    was a constant refrain of the old saw that our mechanics were lying on their
                    back in the mud and snow to repair the trucks and the Germans had these
                    wonderful new facilities with clean pits, and that the living conditions in the
                    German barracks were superior to the ones we were occupying. To a large degree,
                    that was a reflection of the factual situation. There was considerable pressure
                    on the part of the U.S. military to improve the quality of service to the
                    servicemen in Germany. The embassy became the vehicle through which that concern
                    was brought to bear on the German government at the political level and over a
                    long period of time. For a while, I was the point man as political counselor on
                    that offensive. We were dealing with a politician named Dohnanyi, brother of the
                    famous conductor, who was the special negotiator of the chancellor on this
                    matter. There were a number of exchanges between the ambassador and Dohnanyi,
                    the foreign minister, and every politician we could get our hands on. It all had
                    to do with getting German resources in order to improve the barracks situation
                    for us. It was a tough issue. It was not one that got people mad at each other
                    but it did not go very smoothly.</p>
                <p>Another issue was that within the embassy we had, I recall, 13 different offices
                    that were run by military personnel. That may seem like an extraordinarily large
                    number. We had three attaches. The large Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC)
                    dealt with the defense ministry on procurement issues. There were a number of
                    intelligence offices which interfaced with different parts of the German
                    intelligence system. We had military running all over the place, with their
                    agenda, their own marching orders, and their own home offices in Washington or
                    at European headquarters. At times it was a little difficult to keep that all
                    together. Frank Meehan, the DCM, had the brilliant idea that he would hand over
                    this function to me and that I would coordinate all this. I was then an FSO-2,
                    which gave me star rank. My job was to try and pull together the 0-6s at the
                    colonel or captain level. Most were personally friendly to me, but not about to
                    shed too much of their autonomy, even when faced with a direct ambassadorial
                    order that they accept my coordinating role. So I found myself practicing the
                    skills of diplomacy within the walls of the embassy. I still think back to this
                    episode with a mix of amazement and disbelief. We kicked around the idea that
                    maybe we ought to get a one star in there and make him the head of all the
                    military. But DOD would have none of that. The attaches came from DIA. The
                    procurement folks came from the Pentagon. They didn't have the same bosses, so
                    the idea of having a one star simply didn't fit the uniformed forces' notion of
                    how to do these things. So we muddled along, continuing to deal with all of
                    these military staffers individually as best we could. This happens in every
                    embassy except that the number of different billets in Bonn, some of them behind
                    sets of locked doors, were not easy to penetrate.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I finally should say a word about the Holocaust. When I got to Bonn in 1978, the
                    Holocaust was not a subject that anyone discussed or cared to discuss. It was
                    taboo. Most Germans were aware at our initial attempts at denazification, which
                    we had quickly given up. Basically, Germans were content to leave things the way
                    they were. And then came the American movie about the Holocaust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “The Holocaust.” It was a TV serial. This was the first
                        one that had really come out that had spelled things out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was for TV. It made its way onto German TV in serial form. It had
                    a profound effect on German opinion. Not that it affected U.S.-German relations.
                    Neither did it affect the German position in Europe. Nor did it affect where
                    Germany stood with respect to the Soviets. But it broke a logjam in the German
                    public psyche. It was present and had to be broken at some point, but it needed
                    a trigger. That TV series was the trigger. On the evening after the showing of
                    the first segment, Ruth and I had been invited by several couples as part of the
                    process of being vetted for membership in a local Rotary Club. We found
                    ourselves in the company of people who were older than we were. They had all
                    been through the war as adults. That TV show was the order of conversation that
                    evening. As I listened to everybody talk about it, what emerged was that, yes,
                    they had known about it; no, they had no part of it, and they were, of course,
                    opposed to it. So, in a way, it was an unsatisfactory discussion to listen to
                    that night. But at least there was a discussion. I also remember shortly
                    thereafter having one of my periodic lunches with an official in the
                    chancellery, Hannes Braeutigam. He later became UN PermRep in New York and
                    subsequently justice minister in the state of Brandenburg. Hannes was a good
                    friend, a calm, considerate, thoughtful individual. We discussed the Holocaust
                    show, and he cried. I don't recall any other occasion in the course of my many
                    business lunches with diplomatic colleagues when I found myself talking to a man
                    who was crying. But he was. This outing of the Holocaust had a deep effect. It
                    made possible a public discussion by people of my age, between parents and
                    children, and among children, and in schools, that was all a part of the western
                    part of Germany coming to terms with its past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that this was probably a good thing or
                        that this was going to screw up our relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was neither. It was a process of people all of a sudden looking at
                    themselves and letting go of what was inside them but had remained suppressed.
                    This was not seen in terms of how it would affect Germany's standing. What I was
                    watching on those two occasions that I just mentioned was the emergence all of a
                    sudden of a personal realization of something that deeply affected them. That
                    evening with the Rotarians, there was no need for me or for Ruth to say
                    anything. We just listened. This was not an American-German discussion. This was
                    a German discussion. It was a discussion of Germans who had never talked to each
                    other about this but all of whom had been through it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Germany when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: In '81 and went on home leave. I had no assignment until the first
                    week in September, when I got a call that I was going to the Senior Seminar.
                    That's where I spent the next year.</p>
                <p>Q: This would be '81-'82.</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It was wonderful. It was just as wonderful as my year at Princeton
                    but in a different way because it was a different program. First of all, it was
                    Washington-based. Secondly, the interaction of the members of the class was
                    tighter than my interaction had been with the other members of the group at
                    Princeton. In the Seminar we were together all the time, basically teaching each
                    other, and interfacing with each other in different settings, in different
                    places, for eight months. It was a mindstretching experience in many ways. It
                    was good to get out of all the issues that I had been dealing with for six years
                    in northern European embassies and to focus on something entirely different,
                    such as the fishing industry in New England, the status of Puerto Rico, the
                    future of IBM in San Jose, California, the output of the Boeing Company, oil
                    extraction in Colorado- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Through the Seminar, I also made very good friends with people of different
                    backgrounds from the Foreign Service. The group was a good one. The military
                    were okay, but I don't think the military sees the Seminar as a choice
                    assignment for its officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The War College was what got their top people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That's right. Later on, my wife was a member of the War College at
                    Fort McNair. She had an equally positive experience there. Of course, they had a
                    far greater number of military officers than we had in the Seminar. The Agency
                    and the Department of Agriculture sent solid people. But I think the Agency was
                    parking someone they couldn't otherwise place, and he didn't contribute much,
                    partly because of the culture he came from, which was the DO. But it was a good
                    group of Foreign Service officers, a rich group, and a diversified group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '82, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: By the late spring, I had been paneled to go to Geneva as DCM. I
                    regarded this as a dream post, having been to Geneva as a student, having served
                    there for long periods at conferences - the Law of the Sea, Human Rights -
                    speaking good French, knowing people there, liking Switzerland, loving Geneva,
                    and having basically walked every street on foot in Geneva during my eight
                    months of TDY, and returning to the UN environment that I had cut my teeth on in
                    the beginning when I was in L in New York and in Geneva.</p>
                <p>The ambassador was Geoffrey Swaebe, a senior businessman from California. He had
                    been head of the May Company. He was a personal friend of Nancy Reagan's. He
                    anMrs. Swaebe were self-assured, approachable people. Geoff had a very good
                    sense for people and situations. He could not have reached that stage in
                    business life without those qualities. I had one interview with him in
                    Washington, at the end of which I was informed that he had chosen me as his DCM.
                    So I was looking forward to an ambassador I didn't know but whom I thought I
                    could work with. So, in fact, in my last month of the Seminar, I clocked out for
                    about a week and went to Geneva and got briefed there and returned, finished the
                    Seminar, took my summer vacation, and went to post.</p>
                <p>I went there in early July in 1982. I left in November of 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What mission was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: This was the United States Mission to the European Office of the
                    United Nations and other International Organizations. I have never had a
                    visiting card with such a long title before or after. I was the DCM. Our offices
                    were located in a spanking new building overlooking the lake and the United
                    Nations, on the west side of the lake. I was parked for a couple of weeks in the
                    apartment that had been occupied by my predecessor, Don Eller. But the mission
                    had located a residence across the lake in Chene Bourg, north of Old Town. It
                    was a brand new villa surrounded by a wall which I'm sure our security officer
                    liked for that reason. It was a spacious and elegant house with a nice garden.
                    By the time Ruth joined me, I was already installed. Like the residence that we
                    enjoyed in Bonn, this one was spanking new. We put it to good use. I had to,
                    because the entertainment responsibilities of the job were enormous. But I can
                    come back to that later.</p>
                <p>What was the post like? It is a post that handles the U.S. relations with a large
                    number of organizations. These included the UN proper (with the Office of Human
                    Rights), pluUNCTAD [UN Committee on Trade and Development], the International
                    Telecommunications Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the
                    International Labor Organization, the World Health Organization, the UN High
                    Commission for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World
                    Council of Churches, the International Wildlife Association and others.. We were
                    also doing business with the International Committee on Migration [ICM]. There
                    are a lot of other UN-associated organizations in Geneva. There were also many
                    NGOs. We dealt with them all. When I got there, the U.S. Mission was in a heavy
                    operational relationship with ICM and the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross, which is a Swiss organization that implements the Geneva Conventions.
                    There had been incidents and many deaths in the refugee camps in Lebanon, Sabra,
                    and Shatila. There was an immediate need for moving refugees. I found myself
                    involved in the logistics of those operations. Typically, when things like that
                    happen in the world, NGOs get involved. You don't see much about this
                    operational side in the press, but things have to be done and paid for, and the
                    systems management is often in U.S. hands. That is where the U.S. Mission in
                    Geneva came in.</p>
                <p>There were other negotiations in Geneva that involved the U.S. but that were not
                    part of the U.S. Mission. The START negotiation was independent of the U.S.
                    Mission. It had its own ambassadors. The CCD, where I had served in my earlier
                    days, was operating independently with its own ambassador. The GATT and
                    everything that later became the World Trade Organization was handled by yet
                    another American ambassador. They were all independent and we had no direct
                    policy relationship with them, except that the Mission did provide the logistics
                    for all of these operations in terms of the housing, offices, and
                    transportation.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We had a lot of visitors. All these organizations attracted many
                    delegations throughout the year, some of them quite large. The WHO would draw
                    the presence of an Assistant Secretary of Health and Education, but also of the
                    Surgeon General, Dr. “Chick” Koop. The annual meeting and the meeting of the
                    board of the International Labor Organization would also bring in large
                    delegations. The officers in the political session in the Mission followed the
                    WHO, the IPU, the ILO, the WMO, and WIPO. I deliberately mention these acronyms
                    because Geneva is a town of acronyms. We had to keep track of what was going on
                    in the bureaucracies of these organizations because, typically, up to one-third
                    of the funding was American. We had major equities in many of the programs of
                    these organizations. So we were heavily involved in watching and influencing the
                    operations and the policies of these organizations. This meant that the
                    ambassador and I had direct dealings with the directors general of the WHO and
                    the ILO, Dr. Mahler and Monsieur Blanchard, and their colleagues in other
                    organizations. We also entertained them and other senior staffs, and they
                    entertained us. I already mentioned that the entertainment level at Geneva was
                    intense. It wasn't just all a matter of eating and drinking. It was affording
                    opportunities all day long to work with contacts and to get our job done.</p>
                <p>The role of Ambassador Swaebe was unusual. He had no questions about the fact
                    that he was the boss. But he had his own notion of how a DCM ought to operate.
                    An example of that approach was that we had a daily staff meeting which he
                    attended, but which I chaired. At some point in the proceedings, I would of
                    course call on the ambassador, as I did on the others. But he never interfered.
                    The other element of his approach to dealing with me was that he wanted to spend
                    a lot of time with me. Typically, I would be in early to read the cable traffic.
                    A little later, we would have our staff meeting. Then I was ready to get to my
                    desk. But after staff meeting, Geoff Swaebe wanted to sit down for a nice long
                    chat. It made me uneasy because I could just visualize the in-box growing by the
                    minute. In retrospect, however, Geoff Swaebe's approach was a fine way of
                    operating. It served him, because he heard a lot from me. And it served me,
                    because I had his support. His approach was to give me full authority. He backed
                    me up in public even though he might tell me later in private that I might have
                    done something differently. So I knew that I did not have to worry about the
                    ambassador. As a result, I had a lot of authority in the Mission, since
                    everybody knew that the relationship was solid. Ruth and I got along well with
                    the Swaebes. We shared some very amusing and funny incidents. Swaebe did not
                    like to go to bed late, so by the time it was 10:30 at dinner parties at the
                    residence, he would tell me, “I'm going up stairs now. You say 'Goodbye' to my
                    guests.” At another time, we got instructions to make the residence available
                    for a dinner for four people. The ambassador was not to attend the dinner. It
                    was a mystery to us what was going on. We proceeded as ordered, and the staff
                    set the table for four. The ambassador arranged to be out of the house. Four men
                    showed up, had dinner and left. Geoff had told me earlier, “I want you to come
                    to the house when they're gone and we'll just chew the fat for a bit.” So around
                    10;30 in the evening I turned up at the residence and then, just by chance, as I
                    was leaving, we looked at the guest book. Like perfect gentlemen, all four
                    guests had signed their name in the guest book. So we knew what was going
                    on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The visitors were there to discuss the Israel/Palestine issue. It was
                    arranged out of Washington. It was on U.S. ground.</p>
                <p>Geoff also had an original approach to efficiency reports. He explained to me
                    that in the May Company, when they hired somebody, he would have that person
                    tell the board what he proposed to do for the company. That was then committed
                    to writing. Then, at the end of the year, that same person had to take that
                    checklist back to the board with a notation as to what he had accomplished. So
                    the board could see the difference, if any. Operating on that principle, he
                    said, “You write your efficiency report and I will cut out all the cr-p.” In the
                    Foreign Service at that time, it was already customary to ask officers to
                    provide at least raw input for efficiency reports. It was then the rater's job
                    to put it all together. But Geoff took the process one step further. He said the
                    only person who can really know what he's doing is the person himself, and the
                    only person who is the best judge of saying whether the job he has done is the
                    person himself. It made sense to me and I found it helpful. It cut through the
                    mythical notion that efficiency reports are somehow magically written by raters
                    who spend an entire year thinking about their subordinate's performance.
                    Swaebe's introduction of real world practices seemed to make sense to me. I did
                    of course run into the fact that my predecessor, Don Eller, being a nice guy,
                    had been giving top ratings to everybody he rated for several years. It fell to
                    me to ratchet that down a little bit. The practice of overinflated reports was
                    widely known to be common in the Foreign Service, but the situation in Geneva
                    was out of bounds. My new approach, of course, was not all that welcome. But
                    with the ambassador's authority, I did make it stick.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The issues. One issue that I dealt with directly was as cochairman - with the
                    British DCM - of the Geneva Group. This was the group of countries that
                    contributed the most money to the United Nations system. So,, Switzerland was on
                    this group even though it was not a member of the UN. Our job was to keep UN
                    budgets in check. These were the Reagan years and there was administration and
                    congressional pressure to keep the exponential expansion of the expenditures of
                    these organizations in check. We had an Assistant Secretary of State by the name
                    of Newell, a young man. He had come in as a worker bee with the Reagan election
                    and had been rewarded with the job. He tried to carry out this zero growth
                    budget idea, which caused all sorts of difficulties, given the fact that even
                    inflation would cause a certain increase every year in these already large
                    budgets. Nonetheless, the two officers who were working with me on this, and my
                    cochairman, the British deputy chief of mission, David Moss, spent a lot of time
                    not only jawboning the Directors Generals of the organizations, but also going
                    into detailed budgetary review of the budgets of these organizations. That was a
                    complex and difficult undertaking, because these financial directors held high
                    UN rank and did not take kindly to having outsiders come in and look over their
                    shoulders, because they had been used to doing business for many years without
                    that sort of supervision. So we found ourselves in an uphill fight all the way.
                    While we claimed some success, it was never enough to satisfy our masters in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that Geneva would have been a hotbed
                        or a softbed of time servers, bureaucrats, of other nations, a good place to
                        put people who were the relatives of the powers that be in their country and
                        that this would have meant a heavily padded bureaucracy there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: It really wasn't. At my level I was dealing with top-level people,
                    who were bright, motivated, turf conscious, and mission conscious. The Director
                    General of the World Health Organization had programs that any reasonable person
                    would say were good, to eradicate disease, tackle HIV, and go after all sorts of
                    smaller diseases that could be handled effectively by the WHO, and were. He had
                    around him a group of lieutenants who were excellent in their field, good
                    doctors, good administrators, and a lot of loyal others who spent many days and
                    months in unattractive countries trying to implement those programs. As to the
                    work of the UNHCR, most of the staff was in the worst parts of the world trying
                    to deal with immense refugee problems in camps. If you wanted to have a soft
                    life, you would not want to be engaged in these activities. You wouldn't want to
                    work for UNHCR. The International Committee of the Red Cross was always active,
                    in dangerous places where there was conflict. At every level, people were
                    risking their lives to do their job implementing the Geneva Conventions. Sure,
                    there was always the odd loafer, the odd obviously misassigned person. But in my
                    time I found more chaff and misplaced patronage at the Secretariat in New York
                    than I did in Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Now, Geneva is, of course, a pleasant place to be. Some of the sinecures, like
                    the staff of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which droned on
                    year after year after year, got bored and became a bit of a bore. But to a large
                    degree, Geneva was doing the things that the world wanted, like delivering the
                    mail, forecasting the weather, and protecting patents. The international staffs
                    were smart folk who knew what they wanted and who were willing to fight for
                    their budgets and argue for their programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other points should we cover in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was often confronted by questions from my colleagues who were
                    posted in Geneva for the first time. They would call on me and ask: “Well, what
                    do I do,?” because this is not a bilateral post. There is not a government to
                    talk to. There is not a country to observe and report on. And my answer was that
                    all they needed to do was get involved in the operation of the international
                    organizations that the diplomatic missions had relationships with. Most of my
                    colleagues took that advice, and had happy assignments, though I was surprised
                    to see how ill-prepared many diplomats, including some of our own, were for this
                    multilateral work. It was not something that they were used to. Certainly, a lot
                    of Europeans were not, although many Europeans, once they got used to it, were
                    very good at it. It involved giving direction to large bureaucracies, focusing
                    on the politics and policy issues in the Executive Committee or the Board or the
                    General Conference of a certain organization, exercising advisory roles of some
                    sensitivity to visiting delegations on all sorts of issues, whether they had to
                    deal with the Israeli-Palestine conflict or the China issue or the Cuba issue. I
                    should mention another realm of activity, namely human rights. The human rights
                    part of the UN Secretariat was located in Geneva. In the old days, I had been a
                    member of our delegation to the Human Rights Commission, working for Mary Lord
                    and then Marietta Tree. So I knew how that operated. This time, I was watching
                    Dick Schifter, who arrived as the new representative to the Human
                    RightCommission. Dick sought me out because it was clear that I needed his help
                    and he needed mine. He needed mine to do his business, to meet people, to lobby,
                    to have access to people, and to entertain. Ruth and I frequently did so at our
                    house. We would have a large number of people for dinner - Dick and his human
                    rights crowd. Dick also needed advice on how to operate within the Human Rights
                    Commission. That was a sensitive thing because Dick, who became a very good
                    friend and has remained a good friend ever since, came from a school of thought
                    - lawyer that he was - that held that if somebody said “I will do this,” then
                    that would happen. But, as he assiduously lobbied over dinners, drinks, and
                    otherwise, with beautiful argumentation for a particular position or a
                    particular vote, he discovered that, when the vote occurred, those colleagues
                    whom he thought had told him they would vote one way, did not. And he would come
                    to me and say, “Well, wasn't he supposed to vote with us? They told me they
                    would.” I had to say, “That's the way the world works. This is not a legal
                    setting that you're in. You're in a political setting, where you have to realize
                    that maybe they accepted your dinner invitation because they felt no way out,
                    but their reaction to the dinner may have been to get as far away from the U.S.
                    as they could as soon as they went home. You're just seeing the effect of that.”
                    Anyhow, something like that was always going on and Dick soon learned the ropes,
                    and he became a superb head of delegation. I was not a member of the delegation
                    myself, although I think there were times when my name was on the list. At any
                    given time, there might be 20-50 delegations in town for all sorts of meetings.
                    Some of them were one-man shows; they didn't need our care or input or help.
                    Others needed it all the time. One issue which always drew the Mission staff and
                    us in was that of Israeli representation. We had to be ever watchful for efforts
                    to throw Israel out of meetings. That's where the political section and I did
                    get involved a lot. We would pull the strings of the resident network in Geneva
                    in order to keep that from occurring.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>But how do you control all these loose horses? Ambassador Swaebe made it very
                    clear that he wanted every U.S. head of delegation, no matter how small the
                    delegation or insignificant the meeting, to call on him on his first day in
                    town. With his authority he could pretty well make this requirement stick. When
                    he wasn't there, they called on me. When they called on him, I sat in. So at
                    least he and I had an idea as to why the people were there, who sent them, what
                    they were supposed to achieve. Then we would tell them about any problems that
                    we saw for them. Some of them were very happy to get advice. Others felt that
                    this was just an intrusion on their prerogatives to operate on their own. So an
                    awful lot of diplomacy was required in dealing with our countrymen, who all felt
                    that they had been chosen by God to come to Geneva to do the Lord's work and who
                    were miffed if they felt we were trying to keep them from doing so.</p>
                <p>I should also mention the fact that we were backstopping the logistics of all the
                    other permanent delegations. This took quite an amount of my time. The afternoon
                    of my arrival, on my first day at post, I went to a reception. Kitty Fields, the
                    wife of Ambassador Lou Fields, then ambassador to the CCD, came up to me and
                    said, pointing her finger at my tie and grabbing it,”You have my garden
                    furniture.” From that point on I knew that I was going to have to deal with a
                    lot of goods - furniture, china, official cars - and that I better be tough. We
                    had a lot of ambassadors in town. Ed Rowney was doing START, with his deputy,
                    Jim Goodby. Both had the rank of ambassador. Paul Nitze was doing the
                    intermediate range missile negotiations. He and his deputy, Mike Glitman, both
                    ranked ambassador. Ambassador Lou Fields was at CCD. There was an ambassador of
                    GATT. So there were just six resident ambassadors right there, not to mention
                    the one that was dealing with UNCTAD. At one time, I counted 13 persons in town
                    with the rank of ambassador, not all of whom were resident, but seven of whom
                    were. They all needed housing, official cars, drivers, and something to show
                    like china and garden furniture. Guess on whose door they came knocking? They
                    didn't want to bother Ambassador Swaebe with those things but they sure as hell
                    wanted them from me. So I had to be judicious, polite, nice, and tough. I had
                    only so much to give out. The problem was that each of them was funded in
                    different ways, not always by the State Department. So, in some cases, we
                    controlled the funds and sometimes they came with their own funds, and they
                    handled these funds themselves. So there was lots of material on which to
                    exercise diplomacy right in-house.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: John Davis Lodge comes to mind. Though quite old, he was alive,
                    almost miraculously, in those days and he was the ambassador in Bern. When he
                    tried to stand, he had on occasion to be literally supported by his staff.
                    Despite all of this, John Lodge added a certain cachet to that position and gave
                    it a class that only a Lodge could. I had worked on the UN delegation headed by
                    his younger brother, so I was familiar with the Lodge style. Lodge saw himself
                    as the prime American in Switzerland. Since he was the bilateral ambassador, he
                    was right. But when people came to Geneva they came not to Switzerland; they
                    came for UN businesIn many cases, Lodge couldn't have cared less. But when he
                    thought about the personage who was coming was within his realm, he did get
                    interested and he would come down. Once, George Bush, who was then Vice
                    President, came to introduce a new American position at the CCD. That made Lou
                    Fields the ambassador he was dealing with. Geoff was not in town. I was Charge.
                    Lodge was coming down. So I had Fields and Lodge, and myself. Every other
                    ambassador in town also wanted a piece of the Vice President. Bush came alone
                    without Mrs. Bush. So we agreed that there would be no spouses at the airport.
                    But as I arrived at the airport, there was Mrs. Kitty Fields. And there was John
                    Lodge, who was almost literally steaming because, as he put it, “The Vice
                    President will come off this plane and he will see you and he will immediately
                    say, “Where is Francesca (Mrs. Lodge)?” He was hot under the collar about the
                    fact that Lou had broken ranks. But what Lou had done was what you would expect
                    Lou to do. He had broken the rules. “I'm going to get Kitty in there.” Well,
                    what then happened was that Bush came off the plane. Lodge was the first to
                    greet him. Then the rest of us greeted him. Then Lodge, who suspected the worst,
                    thought that Fields would play another dirty trick on him, and usurp his place
                    in the motorcade. So he quickly moved away and got into the Vice President's
                    car, just to be sure that he would be riding with the Vice President, which he
                    was supposed to do anyway, but he just wanted to be sure. At that point, my
                    wife, who was handling the press, released the press and they came with all
                    their photo apparatus. The next day, on the front page of the “International
                    Herald Tribune,” there was a picture of Kitty Fields with her arms open as if to
                    embrace Mr. Bush, and Lou Fields standing behind her, and me right in the middle
                    of the picture, but no Lodge. I called the DCM in Bern at once and said, “Brace
                    yourself when the ambassador reads the press tomorrow.” He handled it as best he
                    could.</p>
                <p>Some of the ambassadors were hard to handle. Ed Rowney was modest. With Paul
                    Nitze I never had any problems. Others were more difficult sometimes.</p>
                <p>The entertainment part of the job was huge. The count for one year in our house
                    was 4,000 guests for food and drink. One reception was for the executive board
                    of the World Health Organization - all the surgeons general of the world. They
                    all came. I don't think they had any idea who I was. To them, the reception was
                    just the Americans giving the party in somebody's house. But I noticed one
                    thing. Nobody smoked. But they drank like fish.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There is a story of my departure from Geneva because I was kicked out
                    by the next ambassador, a political appointee who had been head of GSA. He was
                    uncomfortable in Geneva and had difficulty adjusting to a life that he didn't
                    know and a role he had trouble grasping. He treated the Mission officers and me
                    roughly, though in the end he gave me a courteous send-off. For a while he tried
                    to do without a DCM. Eventually, the system reasserted itself.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I'm director of the Office of Western European Affairs from December

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The office's responsibility included six countries: France, Spain,
                    Portugal, Malta, the Vatican, and Italy. That is less than Western Europe but
                    that was the way the European Bureau was organized.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germany sort of stood alone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Germany was part of an office called EUR/AGS, Austria, Germany, and
                    Switzerland. Northern Europe was Britain and the Nordics. That's the way the EUR
                    was structured in those days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The relations with the French were on the whole good, though with all
                    the irritations that usually accompanied it, mostly on political-military issues
                    - a bottom factor was French annoyance at the American role in Europe. So the
                    French attempted to make their own views felt, and perhaps cut down the American
                    influence. The Spanish relationship in my time was influenced by the base
                    negotiations. The treaty was up and had to be renegotiated. I was part of that
                    team. Two ambassadors, in Madrid, Tom Enders and Reggie Bartholomew, were the
                    leaders of the team in succession. I worked closely with George Bader from the
                    Defense Department. He was a very knowledgeable man with a huge amount of NATO
                    experience and a respected and senior figure. He represented DOD on the
                    delegation.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>Relations with Portugal were uneventful during that time. The Azores Base
                    Agreement was in effect and there were no major issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like with Portugal, all rest upon the Azores base

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I remember being quite interested in Portuguese politics. The embassy
                    was interested, too. Portugal had become a democracy through a peaceful coup,
                    moving away from a long dictatorship into a democracy. So, the internal
                    political situation was of interest. Portugal was a recent member of NATO. And
                    we had a domestic Portuguese element, mostly in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,
                    which was personified by Senator Claiborne Pell, who was at that time chairman
                    of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. So there was a domestic Portuguese
                    dimension. There were some Portuguese elected members of the House of
                    Representatives from the West Coast as well. So, the Portuguese did have a few
                    oars into American politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll just touch on these and we'll go back to some of
                        them. Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Italy was a firm NATO ally. The country had allowed the stationing of
                    intermediate nuclear range weapons systems as part of the NATO double track
                    decision. Italy was also increasingly the place where U.S. forces were based,
                    not just at SOUTHCOM, the NATO headquarters at Naples. We had an air presence up
                    at Aviano in northern Italy and an army unit in Vicenza. So even though it
                    wasn't apparent at that time, we were already seeing the precursor of what
                    turned out to be the case about a decade later, when Italy was the home station
                    for more U.S. forces than Germany. With a huge emigrant Italian population
                    spread all over the important states in the United States, Italy was a major
                    factor in domestic U.S. politics. Many prominent Americans of Italian extraction
                    were interested and involved in that relationship. So was the Congress. The
                    American-Italian Association was powerful, to the point that its leaders felt it
                    was their right to designate the next American ambassador to Italy. The
                    government of Italy (end of tape)</p>
                <p>-Craxi and Andreotti, a government well disposed toward the United States but
                    chafing under the image of being less than a prime power in Europe, always
                    wanting to be regarded by us as one of the big countries, and frequently
                    displaying an inferiority complex about itself.</p>
                <p>Malta was a thorn, but a minor one, in our flesh. It had a socialist government
                    that had its own ideas about policy between Libya and Europe, and exaggerated
                    notions about the role it could play. One constant about Maltese politics was
                    that the island needed money. The Maltese saw us as a likely source of that
                    money. So they would cause more of a stir than their size would suggest.</p>

                <p>[Portion of interview not recorded]</p>
                <p>-and a capacity for acting that really was astonishing. The EUR Bureau had a
                    strong front office. It set the tone for the rest of the Bureau which gave the
                    Bureau the sense of itself that elsewhere in the Department earned it the
                    reputation of being exceptionalist and stuffy. I don't know whether I've already
                    put on tape the story about Alex Bloch, the EUR officer who was thought to have
                    passed information to a Soviet agent and made news by being arrested by the FBI
                    in Washington. As press coverage about Alex unfolded, Avis Bohlen, a veteran EUR
                    hand, concluded a conversation with me on the subject with the words: “It is
                    terrible for the Bureau.” Maybe it was terrible for the United States. Maybe it
                    was terrible for the Foreign Service. But for Avis, it was terrible for the
                    Bureau. That was a reflection of the Bureau's views of where it stood in the
                    universe. It stood pretty high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to France. In '84-'87, Ronald Reagan was
                        President. How did France fit into the NATO framework? Technically, they
                        were out but they were kind of in. How did they work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: France was a full member of NATO. But France did not take its seat in
                    the DPC, the Defense Planning Committee. So at the meeting of defense ministers,
                    there was no French defense minister. There was a French foreign minister at the
                    meeting of foreign ministers. At summit, of course, France was represented by
                    the French president, often accompanied by the French prime minister. So France
                    was both in and out, but it was far more in than out. As far as the French
                    military were concerned, they just as soon would have liked to be fully in. In
                    fact, SACEUR had working arrangements with his French opposite number, the
                    French chief of staff, that were not widely publicized, although they were not
                    exactly secret, under which French units of battalion strength were going to the
                    U.S. ranges in Germany to train and exercise with U.S. forces. The then French
                    chief of staff, Admiral Lanxade, told me a few years later, when I had a
                    conversation with him in his office, that this was of high value for the French
                    army. That characterized the feeling also of the French navy. The French Naval
                    Attache told me once that the French navy found it easier to cooperate with the
                    U.S. Navy in Europe than with the French army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Slightly before this, I was consul general in Naples.
                        Admiral Crowe, then CINCSOUTH, was saying the French navy was fine. They
                        would participate in maneuvers and found a very effective course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: The French military saw it much to their advantage to be part of the
                    larger framework where they could interface with and cooperate with and work
                    with other NATO forces and learn from them, and leverage their own power by
                    being part of that game. What Admiral Crowe said at the time was true then. It
                    was true in my time. It is true today. The French military would just as soon be
                    part of the show than be on the sidelines.</p>
                <p>So, the problems were not with the military. They were occasionally with the
                    French defense minister, although I don't recall any particular incidents. Ever
                    present was the neuralgic issue of nuclear policy, with the French keeping their
                    national say over their own national nuclear forces, unlike the British, who had
                    put them under NATO command. But the questions remained how they would ever be
                    used, and what the theory for their use would be.</p>
                <p>The problems we had with the French often had to do with style. Many diplomats
                    from the Quai d'Orsay were trained at the Ecole Normale Superieure. They were
                    part of a corps of civilian-trained experts. They thought highly of themselves,
                    and with reason. But they also had an attitude that they always knew best. I do
                    recall that, when taking the job, I made my rounds here in Washington, and went
                    to the French embassy to call on the charge because the ambassador wasn't there
                    that week. It was late in the afternoon, in early December. The charge, Fred
                    Sieffert-Gaillardin, received me in a dark office which reminded me of the
                    opening acts oGounod's Faust - a desk, a dim lamp, and a person sitting, and
                    barely illuminated. The entire conversation was in French. He opened by saying
                    “Welcome, Mr. van Heuven. There are three things I want to say to you.” This was
                    without any preliminaries. “First of all, our countries have never fought each
                    other. Secondly, I'm delighted that there is somebody in your job who speaks
                    French.” This was a dig at my predecessor, Ed Peck, who didn't. “And thirdly,
                    I'm a very busy man, so if you'll please excuse me,” whereupon I left. So that's
                    how we met. Later, we cooperated effectively on the Chirac and Mitterrand visits
                    to the United States. He later became ambassador to Canada. But he did reflect
                    an attitude, and the attitude showed in my first meeting with him. But I could
                    get over this obstacle, because I put myself on his terrain and could speak his
                    language. I also knew his country. I had also learned, while a student and later
                    visitor in Paris, to cope with this sort of rudeness. Eventually, he regarded me
                    as up to the mark. But if I had been another Peck, who didn't speak French, I
                    think I would have had a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The relation between the Americans and the French has
                        always been a difficult one and it's showing in 2003. The gap is probably as
                        bad as it's ever been. I'm surprised that the French didn't want to make a
                        friend of somebody in the State Department who was dealing with their
                        affairs. It strikes me as being counterproductive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: With me, it wasn't counterproductive. I had enough experience in
                    Paris, with the French language, and with Frenchmen, to understand what I was
                    seeing and not be upset by it. I worked well with Fred later on. But the people
                    like Fred, and there were quite a few, didn't really see it as their job to make
                    friends the way diplomats are expected to do. They sometimes felt that it was
                    their duty to tell you what the rules were. That would come to the fore on
                    occasion. My experience earlier and subsequently, both with younger French
                    diplomats and also at a later stint as a Board member of an industrial company
                    in the United States that was wholly owned by SNECNA, was far different. The
                    young diplomats, some of whom are in the service now, are doing a wonderful job
                    with American colleagues. They don't seem to have those hang-ups. They
                    understand the United States. They have no hang-ups about preserving the French
                    language. They are comfortable using English. The businessmen even more so. They
                    couldn't care less, as long as the business ran right. They worked happily with
                    Americans. So the attitude comes from a particular set in the French upper
                    class. French foreign policy is still run by an upper class far more than the
                    United States is. That elite, which is specially trained, educated, and well
                    interconnected, operates with an air of authority and a sense of self that is
                    reflected in their dealings with the outside. Paradoxically, it doesn't always
                    serve the French cause.</p>

                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The inspecteur de finances does more than either a customs agent or
                    an IRS official here. An inspecteur de finances can fulfill a wide variety of
                    functions, including the diplomatic. In any event, my colleagues in EUR and L
                    had to suffer through these problems in dealing with the French. Sometimes we
                    had excellent personal friendships or good working relationships, but still we
                    could have tremendous rows about details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the disco was bombed in Berlin and we
                        attacked Libya and the French balked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The disco was at the time not thought to be connected to Libya. That
                    connection was established only later. The overflight issue arose in connection
                    with our air strike out of the blue, so the overflight was not on the front page
                    of the newspapers. Of course, we requested permission. We got it from the
                    British and we didn't get it from the French. Later, I thought that, had history
                    repeated itself, the British would probably have refused takeoff rights, and the
                    French would have let us overfly. But that's the way it worked out at the time.
                    The air force flew around France. It made the mission longer and trickier. But
                    it didn't affect the result.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: No, because we never had overflight rights over France. I don't think
                    even our regular military traffic to Frankfurt went over France. I think it went
                    over the Netherlands and Belgium. By the same token, we never had overflight
                    rights over Switzerland either, although there were occasional exceptions. I
                    remember being on a Luftwaffe plane once, taking a German defense ministry
                    official from Bonn to the Sixth Fleet for a visit. The Swiss gave overflight
                    permission. But that was a German military plane. They asked for permission and
                    it was granted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There was a visit of Chirac, who was then prime minister, to
                    Washington which I had a hand in. There was also a visit of President Mitterrand
                    to Governors Island on the Fourth of July of 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the 100th anniversary of the inauguration of the
                        Statue of Liberty, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: Right. It was a full-blown visit. I spent a lot of time on that with
                    Fred Sieffert-Gaillardin. I also happened to be with Secretary Shultz in Paris
                    on the day that Chirac became prime minister for the first time. Chirac wanted
                    to see Shultz, so that afternoon at 4:00, two hours after Chirac had been
                    installed in office, we were in his office for a business call.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Chirac was a robust man in manner, appearance, behavior, talk, and thinking. He
                    was also impetuous, the Lyndon Johnson of French politics. I remember another
                    occasion when I was the notetaker accompanying Secretary Shultz in the fall of
                    1986 in New York for lunch with Chirac. There were four people in the room:
                    Chirac, the French notetaker, Shultz, and me. Since Chirac was the host, he led
                    off with a litany of complaints about American policy. He had a thing about our
                    behavior in Chad. He had other beefs about what we were doing in Africa. As he
                    was talking, I noticed the danger sign that all of us who had been around
                    Secretary Shultz were aware of. When Shultz was angry, the color of his neck
                    would get red. As Chirac continued with his tirade, I watched the color of
                    Shultz's neck get red. Meanwhile, Chirac was intemperate not only in the points
                    he made but in the way he made them. Shultz held back and waited until his turn
                    came. Then he let go. That was useful. But the ensuing conversation got so bad
                    that the French notetaker and I looked at each other, and we both put down our
                    pens. We just stopped writing. In that conversation between Chirac and Shultz in
                    Paris on the first day of his being prime minister, he was also feeling his
                    oats. He was expansive. He was not so much seeking Shultz's advice. He was there
                    to let Shultz know what he was thinking about a whole variety of issues. There
                    was a small group of four or five on his side. I was the only one of a couple
                    with the Secretary. That was my first impression of Chirac as a robust
                    character. Later on, on his official visit to Washington, he was more of a
                    regular guy. He made jokes and he was earthy. Asked what sort of entertainment
                    he wanted at the White House dinner in his honor, he came up with some rock
                    star's name. We wondered “Where did he get that?” Well, it was his daughter who
                    had been advising him. His daughter was familiar with that scene, being a
                    generation younger. AnChirac was listening to his daughter. So in that sense he
                    was with it. He was a little rough on details, in the sense that he was
                    inattentive to details. But he had his eye on the big picture. And he had a
                    politician's instinct of moving in the right direction, of not trying to swim
                    against the current. What I've seen of Chirac later on bears out the impressions
                    I had of him at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I never experienced Mitterrand directly, although I had a lot to do with the
                    arrangements for his visit to Governors Island. I was on the island on July 4.
                    We had engaged in interminable negotiations with the French on details, like
                    whether President Reagan's helicopter would land first on the island or
                    President Mitterrand's helicopter would land first. The French argued that,
                    because he had already arrived in the United States, as honored guest he should
                    get precedence. And the White House, having its own sense about who had
                    precedence within the United States, held a different view. There was a long
                    argument about the minor matter of where to place the French aircraft carrier in
                    New York Harbor. This Fourth of July featured a long parade of warships from
                    friendly countries down the Hudson, led by the Iowa with the U.S. President
                    aboard. The French said that “We'll have the French president on the French
                    carrier, the carrier will not be at anchor, and then the Iowa will salute the
                    French carrier.” The U.S. Navy and the White House were not about to have that
                    happen in full view of American television cameras. Finally, after a lot of tos
                    and fros, a Coast Guard captain in the room - all these planning meetings took
                    place in New York - said, “Gentlemen, it is time for some plain sailor's talk.
                    There will be a current of about 6.5 knots. There will be 50,000 vessels at
                    anchor watching this parade. If you don't anchor the aircraft carrier under
                    those conditions, there will be accidents. That disposed of the argument. But
                    the French, not to be outdone, arranged at the last minute for Mitterrand not to
                    be aboard when the Iowa passed. He went into the City, to the French consulate
                    to visit with the French community of New York City. So they got around that.
                    But we spent literally hours on that issue and similar issues. So the French
                    were very prickly and very difficult.</p>
                <p>That said, there were some other comparisons where we didn't look too good. I
                    remember going to Paris with Secretary Shultz. We had an aircraft full of
                    people, including press. We arrived at Le Bourget, north of Paris, and we had a
                    50-car motorcade into town that mixed in with the rush hour. You can imagine
                    what that did to traffic. Conversely, when Foreign Minister Dumas visited
                    Washington shortly thereafter, he had two people with him. Because of some
                    security threat having nothing to do with the French, but with the Israeli
                    situation, we had blocked off D Street in front of the State Department. This
                    meant that Dumas had to get out of his car on 21st Street and walk all the way
                    to the main entrance. They arrived on foot without any escort, just three
                    people. I greeted them at the door and took them up. Compared with our 50-car
                    motorcade, they looked good in comparison.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we concerned about the French doing things like selling frigates to
                    Taiwan, dealing with the Soviets? Were there any issues that came up?</p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: There probably were, but I have no present recollection that they
                    were anything more than the ordinary raft of issues. Typically, any briefing
                    paper for a meeting with the French would have 10-12 issues. They changed
                    somewhat with time. But they never in my time peaked to the proportions of an
                    international crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>On the subject of Paris, I should say a word about the American embassy there.
                    During my time, we had two ambassadors, Evan Galbraith and then Joe Rogers.
                    Galbraith was a Yalie and a friend of Bill Buckley. Evan was a nice man. I'd met
                    him before in Gstaad. Then I met him again in Paris. The Yale connection made it
                    easy to deal with him. He was not much older. He was a conservative businessman.
                    He had excellent relations with the French business community and spent a lot of
                    time on that. The French business community was by that time already firmly of
                    the view that American methods had to be adopted if France were to compete
                    successfully. So in a way, Evan was with the tide, if not ahead of the tide. He
                    didn't have much use for socialists and he spent very little time with t hem. So
                    when it came to an overall understanding and view of France, he was an uneven
                    barometer. What I remember most about Galbraith is his departure. When he left
                    Paris, Mrs. Galbraith stayed on a little bit in the residence. She had trouble
                    separating herself from Paris. He didn't balk at his being recalled, but
                    evidently she did. So she stayed on. There was a month or six weeks before Joe
                    and Honey Rogers were arriving to take up their new position. But the six weeks
                    got to be four weeks and then it got to be two weeks and Mrs. Galbraith was
                    still in residence on the Rue St. Honore. We knew she had to get out before the
                    new ambassador arrived. But then Mrs. Galbraith came up with the notion that it
                    would be useful for her to stay on and help Joe and Honey to find their way
                    around in their new environment. She saw herself as the Girl Scout in this whole
                    affair. We were literally less than a week away from the arrival of the new
                    ambassador, and Mrs. Galbraith was still in the residence, showing no signs of
                    departing. Messages from the DG, incidentally, had no effect, because Mrs.
                    Galbraith felt no loyalty whatsoever to the DG, who was George Vest. George was
                    not in her chain of command. So who was going to actually move her out of the
                    residence? The task fell to Jack Maresca, the DCM, to do this somehow. I called
                    Jack and said, “Jack, I've got an interesting assignment for you.” Of course he
                    was well aware of the problem. He didn't quite want to become the designated
                    hitter, but I think he felt it coming. In the event, Mrs. Galbraith left about a
                    day before the arrival of the Rogers. It was a close call. Ambassador Galbraith
                    was nowhere to be seen on this whole issue. He left it to us to persuade his
                    wife.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>A word about Spain. The main issue in my three years was the renegotiation of the
                    base agreement. The most neuralgic part of that base agreement involved our use
                    of Torrejon, near Madrid. We had the use of two other bases: Rota and Zaragoza.
                    The 16th Air Wing was based at Torrejon. The old agreement had expired. The two
                    men under whose leadership I worked on this issue made that new agreement
                    happen. The first was Tom Enders, a classmate of mine at Yale, whom I knew well.
                    When Tom left, Reggie Bartholomew took over. I had also known him for a long
                    time in the service. Both provided exceptional leadership in achieving a base
                    agreement that Washington could live with. In the end we gave up the use of
                    Torrejon, but we maintained rights in the other bases. Rota was particularly
                    important to us because it had one of the longest runways in Europe and was a
                    key route to the Middle East. But to get this agreement, we had to start from
                    scratch in explaining to the Spanish military, many of whom had cut their teeth
                    in the Franco years, that there were alliance requirements to deal with the
                    Soviet threat to Western Europe, and that these requirements necessitated an
                    American military presence. What was very much in the Spanish mind, however, was
                    the residue of their servility that they felt had accompanied the earlier base
                    agreements. There was a sense that the U.S. had imposed itself on Spain and this
                    sense did not square with the growing consciousness of self that accompanied the
                    fact that Spain had now not only become a democracy, and got rid of Franco, but
                    had become a member of NATO. So we were faced with an attitudinal problem, if
                    nothing else.</p>
                <p>Enders and Bartholomew approached this issue differently. Enders, who graduated
                    first in my class at Yale, was an intellect's intellect and he was determined.
                    He explained to the Spanish in the toughest possible terms, without much of a
                    hint of give, why a new agreement was required. In doing so, he reinforced the
                    feelings of servility that our Spanish interlocutors wished to shed. Bartholomew
                    was more adept at constructing a persuasive argument that was not so much “we
                    against you” as “we with you.” Not only did he do that with the Spanish, but he
                    also managed to strike a tough deal in Washington, on which both Air Force, DOD,
                    the NSC, and State could all could sign off, and eventually also was acceptable
                    to the Committee chairmen on the Hill. So Reggie earned his spurs as much in
                    Washington as he did in Madrid. It was interesting to see how differently these
                    very capable ambassadors handled that situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in dealing with our toughest
                        negotiating opponent, the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Reggie handled that pretty closely. He had his contacts from his
                    previous Pol/Mil assignments. He knew a lot of people who could make decisions.
                    The times I was mostly involved with DOD were when I was actually on the
                    delegation and we were in Madrid. George Bader was there representing the DOD
                    views. Of course, the Joint Staff had their persons, and the Air Force had its
                    representatives. I had a lot more interaction with those men than I did back
                    here. The deal that was struck in Washington was struck by Reggie pretty much
                    operating by himself, using his established network with DOD, and doing so
                    effectively.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>I would like to say a word about Italy where I had two ambassadors to think
                    about. One was Max Rabb at the bilateral embassy. The other was Ambassador Bill
                    Wilson at the Vatican. Every time you have two American ambassadors resident in
                    the same city you're like to have troubles. Rome was no exception. The oddity
                    was that they should have been fast friends, but they weren't. Max had been the
                    man who introduced Reagan to the East Coast and tNew York, in particular, long
                    before Mr. Reagan became a successful presidential candidate. Max's reward was
                    going to be the embassy in Switzerland, but then he said, “I don't want
                    Switzerland. I want Rome.” So he got Rome. He stayed in Rome for eight years.
                    Wilson and Mrs. Wilson were personal friends of the Reagans in California. He,
                    too, was directly beholden to President Reagan for his position at the Vatican.
                    But despite the fact that their allegiance ran to the same person and ran
                    without intermediaries, the two didn't mix. They didn't mix to such a degree
                    that, when I went to visit as Office Director, I would visit one, leave Italy
                    and go, say, to Malta, which was also part of my territory, come back, and then
                    visit the other. So I avoided mixing of apples and oranges. Every once in a
                    while, Wilson appeared on the social scene in areas that Max regarded as his. Of
                    course, Max was not above turning up on Vatican territory every once and again,
                    because he had friends there, too, even though he was Jewish. So I was a dicey
                    sort of thing. Each embassy had its own administrative operation so one didn't
                    depend on the other. But obviously, the bilateral embassy was large and the
                    Vatican embassy was small, so there was a disproportion.</p>
                <p>A word about Max. Max to me was an illustration of the proposition that there are
                    certain things in an embassy that only an ambassador can do. Oddly, it is not so
                    much what the ambassador does in the capital to which he's assigned, but what
                    that ambassador can do for the country to which he is assigned in Washington.
                    What the five Italian political parties making up the government needed most was
                    a sense that they mattered in Washington. Thus, each party had a delegation of
                    “prominenza” that would go to Washington once a year to make the rounds and have
                    their picture taken. Of course, they all wanted to visit the White House. But
                    the Reagan White House was pretty parsimonious in agreeing to appointments. So
                    it was difficult to get appointments for all these Italian visitors. This is
                    where Max earned his spurs. He could get them into the Oval Office and he often
                    did. It would take a phone call from Max to the White House Chief of Staff,
                    going around almost everyone in the bureaucracy. Obviously, not all the
                    appointment requests were honored. Vice President Bush always took up the slack.
                    So the Italians had very good reception at the top in Washington in those days,
                    largely thanks to Ambassador Max Rabb. Max was a little deaf. He didn't speak
                    Italian. I can't imagine that he knew the details of the ins and outs of the
                    Italian politics. But he had a good sense of the importance to Italy to U.S.
                    interests, not the least of which were thU.S. military units stationed in Italy
                    and the strategic geographic location of the country. Max was assisted by a very
                    capable DCM, John Holmes. He basically ran the embassy and never got any trouble
                    from Max Rabb for that. So it was a good combination, though on paper Max would
                    have been a typical caricature of a political ambassador. But he wasn't. He gave
                    valuable service to his country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Wilson, did you get involved in the Wilson
                        escapade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: One Saturday morning, Peter Murphy, the DCM, with whom I shared many
                    little battles and a few major ones, called and said, “The ambassador is gone
                    and he's off the screen.” He had left town without telling anybody. Of course,
                    ambassadors are supposed to let at least somebody at the embassy know where they
                    are going to be. It's not just a matter of politeness. It's a matter of good
                    operating procedure. Certainly, the DCM is supposed to know, if only so that the
                    DCM knows that he's in charge. Anyway, Peter told me that Ambassador Wilson had
                    been driven to the airport that morning. He had direct evidence from the driver
                    that Wilson had then boarded a plane. Peter had been able to find out that the
                    flight plan of this private aircraft was to Tripoli. Within 24 hours, Wilson was
                    back in town. Well, I did pass that information up the line. Not that Washington
                    did anything about it. But it was something that Secretary Shultz remembered.
                    Months later, we were about to arrive in Rome and I had to brief him. The
                    Secretary well remembered that Wilson had been off on his own. Wilson was a
                    challenge in other ways, too. The Wilsons lived in a rented villa. President
                    Reagan was going to visit Italy, so the Wilsons assumed that the Reagans would
                    come and have a meal with them. That in itself was controversial, because so did
                    Max Rabb. Mrs. Wilson thought that their dining room wasn't big enough, so they
                    added a dining room to the residence, overlooking the fact that theirs was a
                    rented, historic building to which no changes could be made without express
                    permission of the minister of culture. But the Wilsons went ahead anyway and
                    paid for it. So, what were we supposed to do? The dining room was being
                    constructed, finished, and furnished by Mrs. Wilson. Mrs. Wilson, incidentally,
                    was not just the wife of Mr. WilsoShe was herself a director of Penzoil and a
                    wealthy businesswoman in her own right. She brooked little interference if she
                    had her mind set, and her mind was set on having a lunch for Nancy Reagan. And
                    she did. As far as I know, the dining room is still there, and there's a plaque
                    commemorating the occasion. But the plaque does not record in the footnote what
                    the reaction of the GSO was to all of this.</p>
                <p>The Wilsons also enjoyed the perks that went with the job - the security, the
                    car, the driver, the escorts. And they were all over town. It was rather a show
                    when the Wilsons moved around Rome.</p>
                <p>The Wilsons treated me with the utmost courtesy and great hospitality. They were
                    extremely nice to me. I fancy that on some subjects, at least, I had the
                    opportunity to put my views on the table. Whether they made much difference,
                    it's hard to tell. I'm sure, though, that I could not have talked him out of the
                    Libyan trip, if that was his intent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a lot of flack about Wilson talking to
                        Qadhafi?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Not a lot of people knew about this. It was not public. Nor was it
                    ever clear just how long he saw Qadhafi, or exactly what was said. Wilson did
                    not report his meeting through any channels that I was privy to. I know that the
                    Secretary of State was appalled. Eventually, but a long time later, he managed
                    to convey this into a presidential request for the Wilsons to return to
                    California. But more than a year elapsed before Shultz got that far, because he
                    was dealing with a personal friend of the President's and the President probably
                    couldn't have cared less. This was a tough thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With relations with the Vatican, the Vatican is supposed
                        to have a superb diplomatic corps with very good intelligence. Were we
                        getting much from them? Was this contributing to much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: About every two months or so, I would have lunch with the Nuncio, Pio
                    Laghi, then an archbishop, now a cardinal. In fact, he was the cardinal who was
                    sent just last month to dissuade President George Bush II from starting a war in
                    Iraq.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Laghi had been Nuncio in the Middle East. He was in Haiti when the
                    country became unstable and we sent military forces. The ME was a constant bone
                    of contention. There was as regime change under way, with American political
                    support, in the Philippines. The Vatican also played a role, as did the cardinal
                    in the Philippines, whose name, amusingly, was Sin. Cardinal Sin saw there was a
                    need for a regime change. That was the view of a lot of Filipinos as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Marcos regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: That's right. It was not the view of Mr. Marcos, of course. But Pio
                    Laghi was knowledgeable. I remember our lunches and I remember writing
                    substantive memcons on those issues and sharing them with the affected bureaus
                    in State. So I was drawing on a person with personal experience in the Caribbean
                    and in the ME and the Philippines, and who was part of a network that produced
                    information and views of interest to the U.S. In turn, I would share with him
                    relevant U.S. views and policies. They presumably made their way into the
                    Vatican diplomatic network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether you were getting involved in the
                        Central American issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The short answer to your question is, yes. The Vatican was a source
                    of information, often of a rather broadly based nature. It had good insight. It
                    had a good network. It had good instincts as to what ought to happen. But the
                    Vatican's yardstick as to what ought to happen was of course always different
                    from ours. Their yardstick, ultimately, was what is good for the Church, what
                    would allow the Church to prosper. American interests might or might not
                    dovetail with that. Our yardstick was the American interest. But we constituted
                    a valuable link, which the U.S. maintains, although in the recent past the Pope
                    has caused things to be said that don't square well with American policy. I
                    remember that, in the case of the stationing of intermediate range nuclear
                    missiles, the Pope's position was not very helpful. In the Church hierarchy, if
                    the Pope has a particular view, the cardinals can think what they like, but
                    they're not going to get their way, because it's such a one-man show. The Pope's
                    Polish origins were very useful to us in terms of the change in Eastern Europe.
                    He had a good press in the United States. So the White House handled the Pope
                    with kid gloves. I think any administration would do that. In my time, there
                    were no real questions within our country about the appropriateness of
                    diplomatic relations with the Vatican. I never discussed Church matters with Pio
                    Laghi, although he did once tell me that one of his functions was to make
                    suggestions about the nomination of candidates to become bishop, indicating that
                    his batting average was about 95%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the Italian government, you were there
                        during the Achille Lauro incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: I was, but I played no role in that at all. I was on a trip so I
                    wasn't even in town when this occurred. By the time the incident had occurred,
                    we had located and forced to land in Sicily an aircraft with the perpetrators.
                    The Italians had surrounded the plane. We had surrounded the Italians. There was
                    the issue as to who does what next. This was handled directly by the White
                    House. My desk officer, Tom Longo, managed to worm his way in there. It was late
                    at night. There was a conversation from the WhitHouse with Craxi. Longo
                    functioned as the interpreter on the phone. The situation was complicated
                    further by the presence of Mike Ledeen. He was not in government, but he had
                    good Republican connections with the White House, saw himself as sort of a guru,
                    and for some reason found himself not only on the scene but got himself into the
                    conversation. It was at this very unstructured level, without briefing papers,
                    under crisis circumstances, that the issue of how to deal with the Achille Lauro
                    highjackers at Sigonella was resolved. It showed a breakdown of procedures at
                    Sigonella and in Washington. The interests of the Italians and our interests
                    pretty much dovetailed. We didn't want highjackings. We wanted to catch the
                    highjackers. So the Italians and we ought to have seen this issue in the same
                    way. But how to handle it? American intelligence located the highjackers. The
                    U.S. military forced them down on an Italian base that was mostly used by the
                    U.S. Navy. Then there's the question of who takes over. That hadn't been worked
                    out very well.</p>
                <p>That spat could recur if history repeated itself, but I tend to think that normal
                    coordinating procedures would probably make it less of an issue than it was in
                    this case. The issue flamed out fast.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, did you find yourself trying to work to

                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Max Rabb did a lot along that front and successfully so. Because our
                    basic interests didn't diverge from that of the Italians, it was more an
                    annoyance on the Italian side about how high-handed we were and annoyance on our
                    part that the Italians were in the way of an efficient operation. I've seen that
                    happen in other cases. Left to our own devices, we can be more efficient. But we
                    forget sometimes that, when we're operating on other people's territory, we have
                    to keep the long view in mind. Such an issue may happen agaiDo we want the
                    opportunity to do this successfully once again, or are we going to exclude
                    ourselves from the possibility of doing so? The Italians were relatively pliant
                    on these issues and don't bear grudges. They know on which side their bread is
                    buttered. So, Craxi never made this a sticking point. Neither did anybody else
                    in the government. The Achille Lauro incident did not affect the overall
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I might just say something about one of the functions exercised by my deputy,
                    Tony Kochanek and me in WE. It involved the selection of people. This was not
                    just the function of Personnel. It was an elaborate choreography, in which the
                    candidates were a factor, but so were the posts to which they were aspiring. So
                    was Personnel. And so was EUR. Very often, the brokers in this process were the
                    directors or, more often, the deputy directors of the geographic office.
                    Typically, early in the assignment cycle, Tony and I would run through the lists
                    of all openings that were coming up and all the candidates available. In due
                    course, we would find ourselves targeted by many of these candidates for our
                    support for their particular candidacies. One lesson that we learned over and
                    over again was that, as between the objective of efficiency - taking somebody
                    with language and area experience and putting them in a job where they could be
                    put to immediate use - and the objective of equality or equal opportunity -
                    let's take the guy from a hardship post in Africa and put him in Rome because
                    it's his turn for something that's a little better - equality always won. That
                    was the way the system worked. Rarely did the European Bureau get its way when
                    it came down to the choice of efficiency versus equality. The argument can be
                    made that, in the long run, we were training a broader cadre of people with
                    experience in more than a particular country. In the short run, however, it
                    meant that, for example, when you put a political counselor into Rome who
                    doesn't know Italian and has not served in Italy before, he needs a year before
                    he or she can be effective. In some cases, I've seen those assignments work out
                    in the end, because most FSOs are flexible and motivated to learn. But at the
                    more senior level, particularly in the political and economic counselor area,
                    you are not looking for neophytes. Tony and I were looking for people who knew
                    their stuff and whom the Bureau could trust. But we often found ourselves at
                    odds with Personnel and the DG. This was particularly true in cases in which the
                    DG adopted the practice of directed assignments, where a specific person was
                    nominated to a specific job regardless of experience, language and,
                    occasionally, rank. Thus, we saw stretch assignments, or even double stretch
                    assignments, for reasons that only the DG would know. They were probably pretty
                    good from the DG's point of view. For the geographic bureau, on the other hand,
                    it didn't make much sense. Sometimes ambassadors weighed in. Not all of them got
                    their way. In the end, the assignment of officers was a Washington decision. The
                    7th floor seldom got involved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still talking about Italy, did you find that there was an
                        overconcentration on reporting about the political minuet that went on in
                        Rome? In my time in Italy, I found that the same people were taking
                        different offices and nothing much changed. We seemed to get into the
                        intricacies of the Italian party system or party appointment system which
                        had little interest for the U.S.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The issue of what reporting was useful for Washington was on full
                    display during my time in WE. Most of the large embassies pretty much knew what
                    the traffic would bear. But Italy was probably the best test tube. The
                    intricacies of Italian party politics would be of interest only to an analyst at
                    the Agency, a watcher in INR, and the desk. The desk usually didn't have enough
                    time, because of the press of ordinary business, to go beyond what the embassy
                    or the consulates would send in.</p>
                <p>However, historically, there was much interest in the intricacies of Italian
                    politics. It was for good reason. In the late 1940s, there had been a good
                    possibility that the ordinary working of Italian democracy would have produced a
                    communist government. Indeed, even in my time, the communist party in Italy was
                    huge. In the Cold War, to have a country like Italy turn communist would be a
                    strategic defeat. Therefore, a major American interest was in not having that
                    happen. How do you do that in a country where the largest party are communists?
                    How do you keep them out of government all the time? It means that you have to
                    have coalitions, which together have more votes than the communists. Even so,
                    you have to swallow hard to make that formula work and have the people accept
                    it.</p>
                <p>We put a huge amount of effort into making it work that way. Anybody who thinks
                    that it was the Italians who on their own produced this result is forgetting
                    something: America was always there to make sure that the process didn't produce
                    the wrong result. We were there with influence, with favors, and with lots of
                    money. Speaking now in 2003, with the recent benefit of three more years in
                    Milan as the spouse of the consul general, I have the impression that Italian
                    politics became used to functioning with the influx of a large amount of cash to
                    produce certain results. In other words, we reinforced a measure of corruption
                    into the Italian political system at all levels. While the American influence in
                    domestic Italian politics is now pretty much gone, the pattern of corruption is
                    not. This feature of Italian politics,, which depends largely on favors - as in
                    the cases of Craxi, Andreotti - and on kickbacks, is unfortunate. The U.S. bears
                    a share in responsibility for creating the current situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>Going back again to the reporting, details of Italian politics don't interest a
                    great many people in Washington as long as Italy was with us on important
                    questions. The military forces we had in Italy were an important U.S. interest.
                    With the fall of soviet communism, the threat of the communist party taking over
                    Italy disappeared, though Italian politics today, with Berlusconi, presents more
                    issues of fairness and undue influence than at almost any other time. I don't
                    think anybody in Washington really cares very much about them. What Washington
                    does care about today is that the Berlusconi government has signed on with the
                    Bush administration on issues of importance to the Bush administration. Back in
                    the eighties, reporting from Italy probably provided greater detail than I found
                    necessary for myself. But there were always consumers who did enjoy the details.
                    The top officers in embassies Madrid, Paris, Rome kept their eye on the ball and
                    didn't get off the track with detail. There was a constant calibration as to
                    what type of reporting was necessary and what wasn't. But we had no major
                    difficulties. A typical difficulty that arose in some of these larger countries
                    was the degree to which the embassies tried to control the reporting from the
                    consulates. Some chiefs of mission wanted to get a single view out of the
                    country. Others were willing to let a thousand flowers bloom. Each ambassador
                    and each embassy handled that issue in its own way. Washington lived with the
                    results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: have we covered all the countries now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: I did spend time on Malta because the socialist government and its
                    requests for money required attention. Malta was of interest to us because of
                    Libya. Malta maintained diplomatic relations with Libya and had air connections
                    with Libya. There was a flow of people to and from Libya through Malta. The
                    islands were strategically of importance, far beyond the size of the country.
                    That is true today, as long as Libya is where it is with Qadhafi. But Malta has
                    had to change governments, back and forth. They cannot hold up Europe the way
                    they once did in Madrid, when for six months the CSCE had to wait for Malta to
                    come on board after everybody else had already gone on board. That's not likely
                    to repeat itself.</p>
                <p>I have pretty well covered the issues I meant to cover. This leaves my four years

                    UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From '87 to '91? What were you doing in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The National Intelligence Council (NIC) is a body which is not well
                    known to many Foreign Service officers. The NIC is an intelligence community
                    organization. This means that it is headed by the director of Central
                    Intelligence. This same person is the head of the CIA. In my time, the NIC
                    consisted of 12 individual National Intelligence officers, six of them with
                    geographic responsibilities and six with substantive responsibilities, such as
                    strategic forces, conventional forces, science, global issues, terrorism and
                    warning. I was the NIO for Europe. My principal task was to oversee the
                    production by the intelligence community of national intelligence estimates
                    (NIEs), and other pieces of community intelligence covering the European
                    continent. The area of my responsibilities included Eastern Europe, but not the
                    SovieUnion. The NIEs were our workhorses and also the crowns of our activity.
                    They are estimative documents put together by the intelligence community for a
                    small clientele, including the President and a small number of senior offices,
                    including the Vice President, the Secretaries of Defense and State, and the
                    National Security Adviser. That was our target audience. Once approved, an NIE
                    would be briefed the next morning to these individuals and distributed to
                    another small group. Eventually, it became accessible also to a larger group of
                    people. The NIEs tended to be classified. They were based on all-purpose
                    intelligence, not only from CIA, but also from State, NSA, and DIA. They could
                    also be based on information from newspapers, magazines, personal conversations,
                    academics, or other sources, open and classified. The process is more open today
                    than it was in my time. We published NIEs without any names on them. It would
                    list the functions of the officials who had approved them. Over ten agencies and
                    departments were represented in the estimative process. Only CIA was a pure
                    intelligence organization that was not appended to an operational agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>The NIC had two offices, one at Langley and one downtown. For the approval of the
                    NIEs, we used the downtown office. For everything else, we sat at Langley. We
                    were the senior link between the policy world and the intelligence world. It was
                    my job to interface with the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs,
                    the Assistant Secretary of Defense for ISA, and the NSC officer in charge of
                    Europe. My task was to determine what intelligence support they needed. Mostly,
                    they were too busy with their jobs to figure out what intelligence support they
                    needed. So it fell to me to make suggestions. Mine was an active role. I could
                    tap drafting officers for the NIE process. I had no line authority, but I was
                    usually successful in getting officers detailed to help do the estimates. NIOs
                    had to understand what was going on in their worlds and understand what the U.S.
                    was trying to do within their worlds. They had to figure out what information
                    the government needed, and what analysis the government needed. We could not
                    advocate policy, but we could say, “If you do A, then B. If you do C, then D. If
                    you do X, then you have to watch out for the following.” So, we could - and
                    often did - put things in the alternative. We could do a study that said, “Here
                    are the drivers. Here are the indicators. Here are the possible outcomes. Here
                    are things to keep an eye on.” We had to package it in a way so that the
                    consumer could use it. We had to tailor the NIEs to the tastes of our consumers.
                    In my case, the President was Bush. He had been DCI himself. So he had a good
                    understanding of the process. He knew what an NIE was and he knew what
                    intelligence could do for him. He was one of our knowledgeable consumers. But
                    each president handles his information flow in his own way.</p>
                <p>At interagency meetings one level below the so-called Deputies, the person
                    representing the intelligence community - often me or my deputy - would usually
                    be given the floor first. This gave us the opportunity to shape agendas in a way
                    that few others could, and thus influence the outcome. Of course, we were not
                    supposed to drive the agenda, but if we had views based on analysis - based on
                    facts and information available to us - we could say, “We're heading in a
                    direction which is likely to evolve toward the following results.”</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>We would do between six and eight NIEs a year. Many of them came, went, and were
                    forgotten with the rest. Some of them didn't. In my case, the NIE that caught
                    the most attention and notoriety - but in retrospect was probably one of the
                    least influential - was the NIE we did in the fall of 1990 on the subject of
                    Yugoslavia. The NIE said that Yugoslavia would come apart, that it would be a
                    violent process, and that the country would no longer exist in six months.
                    Unfortunately, these key judgments happened to be right on the mark, including
                    the timing. Meanwhile, the policy world downtown was busy keeping the Soviet
                    Union together and getting ready for Desert Storm. The message that Yugoslavia
                    would come apart was not welcome. It did not fit U.S. Yugoslav policy. This
                    policy was, as it had been for years, to support the territorial integrity and
                    political independence of the country. The administration did not want to hear
                    about federal states coming apart. The U.S. government was trying to keep
                    Gorbachev in power in a federal state. Washington was also busy getting ready to
                    liberate Kuwait. The notion that there might be violence in the Balkans was not
                    part of its script. So the NIE was widely noted but was basically ignored, even
                    by the old Yugo hands, such as Tom Niles, the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    European Affairs, Larry Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, and Brent
                    Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser. All had served in Belgrade. All had
                    grown up with the canonical policy of supporting the political independence and
                    territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. In fairness, Larry was probably well aware
                    that things in Yugoslavia were probably going to change. But he didn't want to
                    advance that change. If anything, he probably wanted to retard it. Warren
                    Zimmerman, who was our ambassador, had also served in Belgrade before. Larry had
                    sent him out with orders that Warren has described in his book, “The Last
                    Ambassador.” But the policy was still, :Let's see if we can keep Humpty Dumpty
                    together,” and here we came along and said, “You can't do it and it's going to
                    blow up.”</p>
                <p>So the NIE became an example of intelligence making the right call and the
                    government basically saying, “No, thank you very much.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We tried to duck it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAHEUVEN: In the words of Secretary of State Baker, we didn't have a dog in that
                    fight. His line to the Yugoslavs was: “Whatever you do, don't fight about it.”
                    That was too late.</p>
                <p>Q: Even before that, you went there in '87. Probably the biggest event in a way
                    in the last century was that the Soviet Union was falling apart. It was going
                    down. Everybody knew there were problems but nobody from the outside really
                    could see what was happening. How about this group?</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Russia wasn't part of my beat. I had two colleagues who successively
                    held the position of NIO for the Soviet Union, George Kolt and Bob Blackwell.
                    Kolt was a Cold War guy. Blackwell was more nuanced. There was a running
                    discussion among Soviet analysts about the Soviet Union. Bob Gates was the DDCI,
                    and then later on DCI. In his confirmation hearings there was the question of
                    whether he had cooked the books on the Soviet Union. He denied that charge and
                    would deny it today. There was an academic debate afterwards as to who saw it
                    wrong, and whether the Agency shouldn't have seen the signs coming of the Soviet
                    breakup. But the fact was that the Estimates on the Soviet Union recognized the
                    many problems but did not draw the conclusion that the Soviet Union would
                    disappear.</p>
                <p>From my vantage point, I looked at the Soviet Union through the prism of Germany.
                    Germany was divided. Europe was divided. My territory was divided because of
                    soviet communism. I went along, in September 1989, with the director of Central
                    Intelligence on a trip to Europe. We spent a day in Germany and visited our
                    German intelligence colleagues. The German intelligence establishment was wholly
                    preoccupied by the upcoming visit of Gorbachev to East Berlin. What they were
                    looking for was whether Moscow would continue to support the East Berlin regime.
                    That event was scheduled for the first week of October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the 40th anniversary of the GDR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Something like that. In any event, there would be a Soviet-German
                    meeting and the question was, “What are going to be the signals coming out of
                    that meeting?” That was what preoccupied the thinking of German intelligence.
                    There was no discussion of the wall, nor the breaching of the wall, nor anything
                    like that. It wasn't on the agenda. It wasn't in anybody's thought. Elsewhere in
                    Europe, there was also no inkling of the fact that things might come to a head
                    within weeks. Of course, there had been large peaceful demonstrations in major
                    East German cities, in Leipzig, in Dresden. We already had seen Hungary opening
                    its borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a real hemorrhage.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Yes. It was significant because East Germans for the first time could
                    get out. They could go to Hungary and then go through East Germany, in closed
                    trains, to the West. So there were plenty of signs that things were changing in
                    Eastern Europe, none that they would change the Soviet Union, and none about the
                    breaching of the wall in November of that year. So, as for my territory, my
                    colleagues and the people with whom I dealt - I could tap into a huge amount of
                    resources, all the way from analysts to clandestine reporting of whatever type -
                    there was no real indicator that all these big things were about to come to a
                    head. There was a trend, but we felt it was a gradual trend. Nobody felt that
                    the earthquake was about to happen. So when it happened - by some quirky
                    decisions and sequences of events in November - the wall opened up, and there
                    was a cascade of events that was out of control. It was a period of about three
                    months. We were all thinking hard about where this could all lead. The dramatis
                    personae in East Germany were changing almost weekly. It was hard to get a grip
                    on that. I do remember writing a little memo to myself in February that said,
                    “There's a possibility of two Germanies with the same president, Richard von
                    Weizsaecker. Many formulas for a future Germany were being kicked around. But we
                    had little idea whether the events would make things flow in that direction. And
                    then to go back to the Soviet Union and your original question, it wasn't until
                    the end of 1991, late in December, that the Soviet Union ceased to exist. So all
                    of a sudden, a Europe that had been divided was no longer that divided. It was
                    still very different, but the dividing line had been breached. So the
                    opportunities for a “Europe whole and free,” - the phrase of President Bush in
                    Germany later on - came closer to realization. We had to start rethinking what
                    this whole of Europe would look like. Certainly in those days, in my own
                    thinking about enlargement, the key issue was whether we should enlarge NATO and
                    whether the EU should also be enlarged. I was strongly in favor of enlargement,
                    if only for the fact that the people to the East had not had the ability to make
                    true what they always felt, namely, that they, too, were Europeans. You ask a
                    Pole if he's European; he's going to say, “Of course I am. I'm from the most
                    European country in the world. I'm catholic.” But seen from the Western Europe
                    perspective, Poland was outside. The major driver was the will of the people,
                    the popular marches in Germany, and then in the successful revolutions in
                    Romania and the Czech Republic. People were driving this change. So it was my
                    feeling that, if that is what the people want, don't stand in the way. What do
                    they want? They want to be part of the West, part of these organizations.
                    Therefore, NATO enlargement and EU enlargement is not only a good thing, it is a
                    strategic necessity. Not to do so will create another division of another type
                    that will cause all sorts of problems. My policy views were shaped by my
                    experience as an analyst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the man who originally you were dealing
                        with, who belonged to the hard-line school that the Soviet Union was a
                        threat that was always going to be there? How much did you all represent
                        your own outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: We did not. We tried very hard not?. Our role was not to advocate
                    policy. What we could say was something like “If the United States government
                    does this, then the German reaction is likely to be the following.” If that were
                    an obviously undesirable reaction, then working that equation backwards would
                    give a message to the policymakers that maybe they'd better think about it
                    again. But we could not say what ought to be U.S. policy and we didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the institutional mindset, the Soviet Union is so
                        powerful that it's almost inconceivable that it will break up because the
                        system is rotten.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, I want to avoid talking about the Soviet Union because during
                    my four years I didn't deal with the Soviet Union. I stood outside of the debate
                    as to whether the CIA and the intelligence community missed the boat on that
                    one.</p>
                <p>But I can tell you something about the process of putting together national
                    intelligence estimateThe process can take up to nine months. First comes the
                    definition of the question or questions you want answered, and running those
                    issues through the interagency process. Then comes the process of answering
                    these questions and running through that same process again. We could have ten
                    institutions around the table, all with an intelligence input and their own
                    perspective. It is possible, of course, that even with ten different agencies,
                    you're going to get a particular mindset, and end up wrong. You cannot predict
                    the future. But NIEs were not so much attempts to predict the future as an
                    attempt to analyze what is there, what people think about it, what are the
                    possibilities, what are the drivers, and what are the limitations. In other
                    words we tried to lay out all the analytical factors. A good NIE might come up
                    with alternative outcomes. I found that consumers often liked this better than a
                    single-view NIE.</p>
                <p>Let me illustrate this point with another NIE that we got approved the same day
                    as the Yugoslav NIE. That was one on Canada. It had been taboo to do
                    intelligence on Canada ever since World War II because we didn't do intelligence
                    on allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also because it would leak.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, intelligence at that level didn't necessarily leak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I would think that the fact that we were even thinking
                        about the splitting up of Canada if it ever got back to the Canadians would
                        have such repercussions that it's almost better not to even think about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Well, that is the essence of my story. The NIC hadn't ever touched
                    Canada. The station in Ottawa was not reporting on Canada. It was there as a
                    liaison function with the Canadian intelligence services. But we had exchanges
                    with the Canadians, and as I worked with the Canadians I became interested in
                    Canada. It was obvious to me that Canada was of major interest for precisely the
                    reason you've just articulated. Not only would almost any expression of American
                    views abouCanadian unity rile the Canadians one way or the other, but Canada is
                    our biggest trading partner, our biggest border, and from any point of view -
                    political, economic, trade - it is the single most important country to us bar
                    none. Here is a country where the talk was about splitting. U.S. officials kept
                    saying, “Well, this is purely a matter for the Canadians. This is a Canadian
                    issue. It doesn't concern us.” Baloney! It concerned us greatly. Imagine for a
                    minute what would have happened if Quebec had voted, as it nearly did a couple
                    of times, for separation. The next morning, Quebec representatives would have
                    been knocking on the door of the State Department asking for recognition. We
                    could not say, “Well, this is a Canadian matter. We leave it to you guys.” They'
                    d say, “We want recognition.” Then we could say “Yes” or we could say “No”. Or,
                    we could say, “Well, we've got to think about this.” We could not avoid making
                    enemies; even, perhaps, we might be making some friends. So, the issue struck me
                    as a crucial question for the United States, and it seemed to me that our policy
                    was inadequate. Therefore, I suggested to Director Bill Webster that we do an
                    NIE on Canada. Broad-minded as he was, he agreed. Some of my colleagues in the
                    system gagged. They said, “We haven't done this. We don't touch World War II
                    allies. We don't target Britain, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada”; I said,
                    “Yes, but here are reasons to think about Canada.” So, we did an NIE on Canada.
                    I recall, it was entitled “Two or Three Canadas.” Had Quebec voted for
                    separation, the west of Canada might have walked, too, leaving Ottawa and
                    Ontario in the middle. So the NIE introduced the notion of not just two
                    countries but three countries up north, and the implications of such an
                    eventuality. I gather that President Bush took all of this aboard and adjusted
                    his public remarks away from the myth that this was just a matter for the
                    Canadians and toward the notion that the USG had an interest in maintaining
                    Canadian unity. President Clinton also took this notion abroad. He expressed
                    support for a particular political outcome in Canada. You could argue that he
                    was mixing into Canadian affairs, but his approach was largely welcome in
                    Canada, though perhaps not in Quebec. But Quebec had no choice but to keep
                    currying our favor. They had their representatives in Washington. They have them
                    now. They act basically as a shadow foreign office. Remember de Gaulle's phrase
                    of “Vive le Quebec libre” when he visited Canada? The French were always ready
                    to play the Quebec card. So, in a way, the Canadian Estimate was more of an
                    attempt to energize the policy world than the YugoslaEstimate, although it was
                    the Yugoslav Estimate that got all the notoriety. My work in that NIE got my
                    colleagues and me the Intelligence Medal of Merit, but the NIE had absolutely no
                    effect on U.S. policy.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: The remarkable fact about this Estimate was that it was unanimous.
                    Typically, an estimate states it was done with the participation of a list of
                    agencies. Any agency that disagreed would append its own views. From the
                    consumer's point of view, it was interesting to get different views. But this
                    one was unanimous on the key judgments. It covered the intellectual brouhaha
                    that had started with a speech on the day of Kosovo Polje by Milosevic. It
                    covered the statement by the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences, and the intellectual
                    underpinnings of the breakup. Of course you can have a lot of intellectual
                    underpinnings, as you always do with the intelligentsia of France, and this
                    still won't translate into policy. But in this case, there was a handmaiden, and
                    his name was Milosevic.. Yugoslavia had kept going through the Cold War years by
                    positioning itself as a leader of the nonaligned. It had been able to command
                    American and Western attention as a lever on the Soviet Union. With the
                    disappearance of the Soviet Union, the lever function lost significance. So
                    Yugoslavia became a backwater. We were no longer interested, because Yugoslavia
                    didn't mean much anymore in the grand scheme of things. Markovic needed help
                    from the INF. But the financial institutions and, for that matter, the U.S.
                    government, were niggardly. Susan Woodward, who wrote a book about the breakup,
                    sees this niggardliness and narrow-mindedness as the basic cause of the downfall
                    of Yugoslavia. There are other books, each with different theories as to why it
                    happened. We didn't delve into these theories in the NIE. Those books hadn't
                    been written at the time. But we did know that Markovic couldn't hold things
                    together. We also knew that things were getting tight. When things get tight and
                    the pie gets smaller, people may start fighting about the crumbs. The fighting
                    among the provinces, the different constituent parts of Yugoslavia, had a sharp
                    tone to it. As the pie kept shrinking, that tone sharpened further by the
                    introduction of nationalist elements. “It's the fault of those Croats that we
                    Serbs suffer” or “It's the fault of those Serbs that we Croats suffer.” This
                    mood eventually led to a feeling of “Well, look at what the Germans in Leipzig
                    have just done. They have managed to detach themselves from the Warsaw Pact.”
                    So, when Slovenia and Croatia broke away, there was a brief war about Slovenia,
                    which the Serbs lost. Slovenia seceded successfully. Then it was just a matter
                    of time before the other provinces tried and ran. Some of them split off
                    successfully. Croatia had great difficulty. So did Bosnia. Macedonia was
                    unsuccessful. So was Kosovo, until the Kosovo war. So the unraveling of
                    Yugoslavia was gradual but rapid. Western inattention was a contributing factor,
                    as was the misplaced hope that, somehow or other, Yugoslavia would stay
                    together. It had been held together by a special set of forces for a long time,
                    including Tito. These forces were no longer present. The outside pressures then
                    did work. The real kicker was Milosevic and his nationalism. That is what tore
                    Yugoslavia apart.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Tudjman, too, in Croatia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: All the regional leaders turned out to be bad guys, the whole lot of
                    them: Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and Tudjman. They were all on a nationalist and
                    personal kick, at the expense of each other. There were no leaders who said, “We
                    have things in common that we ought to build on.” It wasn't the role of
                    intelligence to shape a new policy for Yugoslavia, but it was our role to say
                    “Here is the situation” and note that the existing U.S. policy simply was going
                    to be irrelevant. The policy was forced to change. It did, of course, about 13
                    months later. And then the USG didn't touch the ensuing mayhem, until
                    Srebrenica. Then the situation became a threat to Clinton's reelection. Tony
                    Lake reportedly said to the President, “This is a problem that can cost you the
                    election.” Then Clinton became involved. In the summer of 1995, Lake went to
                    Europe, Holbrooke was appointed and negotiated Dayton. So we pulled the
                    Yugoslavia issue up by its own bootstraps. Had we accepted the Vance-Owen
                    proposals, the outcome would have been a better deal for the Bosnians. But the
                    USG killed Vance-Owen through inattention. This is a long story about a single
                    Estimate.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>I was professionally content in this world of estimates. I lived in a world where
                    it was my job to continually guess “What does Ray Seitz (EUR) need? What does
                    Bob Blackwell (NSC) need? What does David Gompert need in the NSC?” I would try
                    to get them that information, and volunteer pieces on an IC basis, using Agency
                    personnel. There was rivalry between the NIC and the Agency as to who would get
                    there first. In a way, that made for better intelligence. The Agency had to
                    stick to its own system, but I could roam all over. Agency analysts were
                    basically in-house people. My mandate was to get out of the office, to know what
                    academia was thinking, what was going on in the NGOs. I used to do off-sites. My
                    job was well funded, so I could get the best heads in the United States together
                    on an unclassified basis, in some agreeable site within 50 miles of Washington,
                    spend a day or so, and do a report. Those conference reports were not national
                    estimates, but they were wonderful devices. These products generally got good
                    readership and stood up to the test of time. I could live in the unclassified
                    world as well as in the classified world. I could bring to bear all sorts of
                    talent that I could hire, for comment and advice. CIA did little of that in
                    those days. They saw themselves as good enough without being able to go outside.
                    But their views, as a result, were narrower. Today, the situation is different,
                    because all these offices have been vandalized. The former European experts have
                    been put to work on antiterrorism instead of on Europe. In short, I felt I had a
                    great assignment. It gave me visibility. With three exceptions, I visited every
                    country in Europe; a number of them more than once. I was on the road almost
                    every month. I could see people in other governments at policy level. I knew
                    most of the U.S. ambassadors in Europe, and what they were thinking. When I
                    traveled, I was handled by the stations, so I could get a glimpse into their
                    world and what they thought. Often, the thinking would be different. Some of the
                    station chiefs used their ability to input their views into Washington through
                    their own channels. In my travels, I gained greater appreciation of the fact
                    that many FSOs are not attuned to the fact - and to the extent that they are,
                    don't want to accept - that there is a lot more than State and DOD to official
                    U.S. activity overseas. In some cases, particularly where money talks, the
                    station chief could be a key player. So, a visit to an embassy was always an
                    experience. On a visit to Poland, I found that part of the Embassy had come to
                    regard the Poles as our friends, while other parts of the Embassy still saw them
                    through Cold War lenses. So, being the NIO was a heady assignment and it gave me
                    a lot of exposure. Moreover, I think I was the first NIO/EUR who went to Eastern
                    Europe as NIO rather than under State cover. I insisted on that. Milt Bearden at
                    the DDO, agreed. I'd spent half my life and half my professional life in Europe.
                    My identity was well known in many countries. To pretend that I was a State
                    Department officer in some fictional job when, in fact, I was a senior
                    intelligence officer in the United States government, made no sense. So, when I
                    went to Belgrade, Warsaw, anBudapest, I went as NIO Europe. The stations didn't
                    take easily to the idea but they got used to it. It worked out fine. Right now,
                    NIOs are identified by name on the NIEs. They travel as NIOs. It's all above
                    board. But I was at the cusp of that change, and I was one of the very first
                    NIOs to do that.</p>
                <p>So, Yugoslavia kept me busy, but so did the issue of German reunification, and
                    the issue of how the U.S. interfaced with the European Union. We did estimates
                    on that as well. It was an intellectually heady time. We had to think widely and
                    we could tap into all possible resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Europe was reorganizing itself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Just beginning to. Certainly by '91 it had reformed itself, but the
                    question is, what have we got now? I can't pretend that we in the NIC were the
                    star that appeared over Bethlehem, but I think that we illuminated thinking
                    about Europe in a way that was generally helpful. I found the experience
                    ultimately enjoyable. It made for a natural transition to what I did after the
                    government, at the RAND Corporation and the Atlantic Council, and what I
                    continue to do today, which is to think and write about Europe.</p>
                <p>I'd like to say two more things about the NIC. One is about the culture of the
                    intelligence world. When I came to Langley, I found an organization that
                    reminded me of the State Department 30 years earlier. There was, in effect, an
                    Assistant Secretary's dining room. Only GS-16 and above could eat there, and
                    cheaply at that. It was also one of the best restaurants in town. It was like
                    the old Assistant Secretary's dining room at State in 1957. It was a male
                    culture. It was also a white shirt culture. And it was a Virginia culture, a
                    southern culture, all of it different from the State Department in '87, but
                    reminiscent of the old boy school network that characterized the situation in
                    the late '50s and early '60s at State. I encountered a time warp. Langley simply
                    was way behind State. And State was closer to the country than Langley ever was.
                    I have to be a little careful because when I say “Virginia,” I really meant
                    Virginia. You know this area. There is a difference between Georgetown and Old
                    Town, Alexandria. That distinction was palpable. There were a lot of
                    Southerners, particularly in the DO, just like in the Army. They had their own
                    ways. Women who had important jobs were the exception and not the rule. That is
                    now beginning to change. But Langley in 1991 was still quite starchy.</p>
                <p>The other has to do with the product. Most FSOs, to the extent that they deal
                    with intelligence products at all, tend to find them unilluminating, boring,
                    even wrong. In my time at State, I got briefed every day. The briefer would walk
                    in and show the book of folders. My reaction often was “This is drivel and I
                    know it already.” The unfortunate fact was that, since the policy world is never
                    very good at asking the intelligence world what it should need, the intelligence
                    world is left to figure out what the policy world needs. So the briefers piled
                    it on, and the daily briefing book tended to become junk. A lot of it came from
                    NSA. At one point, when I was in the NIC, I asked the director of NSA if he
                    couldn't do something about this problem. I said, “I've got all this stuff
                    coming in by the reams and there is nothing I can do with it.” He said, “Okay,
                    we'll make you a package.” Every two weeks, somebody would come from Fort Meade
                    and hand me a selected package tailored for me, let me see it, and then take it
                    back. I don't think I ever changed my view on any major issue because of that
                    type of input. Yes, I did care what Mr. A was saying to Mr. B or sometimes, more
                    interestingly, Mrs. B. You might learn what new job somebody might be angling
                    for, or what somebody thought of somebody else. But in the cosmic scheme of
                    things, that type of intelligence was not very useful for my purposes. If I had
                    been in the Biographic Division, it would have been useful. But for what I was
                    doing, that wasn't the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Most of the information that I needed to operate at the NIC was easily available.
                    I just had to find it, select it, and put it together in a meaningful way.
                    Secret sources were not key in drafting NIEs. If you're in a military campaign,
                    it's nice to have an informant who tells you where the artillery is hidden. That
                    can save lives. But I wasn't in that sort of a business.</p>
                <p>However, when I got to see how the intelligence community was producing the
                    product which, as an FSO, I had thumbed my nose at, I came to take it more
                    seriously. Sure, it would be no great loss to put aside the incidental,
                    anecdotal stuff. But it was worthwhile to watch for the side comment, or the
                    insight from people who thought and who were well connected, and to look for
                    indicators. I had to learn this as I went. If I didn't, I might miss something.
                    Had we done more of it, we might have been more imaginative in our NIEs about
                    the way Europe was evolving. I also came to view the value of competitive
                    intelligence. The suggestions for having an intelligence czar, and centralizing
                    functions in one particular place, will, I think, not lead to a better product.
                    Decentralization is more useful, because it is more directed to the needs of the
                    policymaker, as long as intelligence doesn't become the excuse for the
                    policymaker. Intelligence can also be highly politicized. When I was testifying
                    on Yugoslavia before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a secret hearing,
                    Senator Bradley asked, “Now, Mr. van Heuven, what would you do?” I said,
                    “Senator, that's a question I cannot answer.” He said, “I'm asking you: what
                    should we do?” I said, “Senator, it is not my job to give a policy
                    recommendation.” Then he said, “Turn off the microphones. I want you to tell
                    me.” So the microphones were turned off. I had a discussion with him. There is
                    no record. I had to hold my ground. No senator can make you say something you
                    don't want to say. You have to stay on the right side of that fence and stick to
                    the analytical line and don't get into policy. Theoretically, I could have had a
                    very different conversation with the Senator over lunch. But in a formal
                    hearing, policy issues were out of the question. Let me just conclude with a
                    word about tandem couples. This has to do with life in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what a tandem couple is.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: In this case, my wife was a Foreign Service officer and I was a
                    Foreign Service Reserve Officer when we met and we got engaged. The rule was
                    very simple. If I was going to become an FSO, which I was on track of becoming,
                    either I had to resign or she had to resign. She resigned. Then, for a while,
                    she was unemployed and our children were born. Then the rules changed and she
                    was allowed back in again, but not until after she had retaken the oral at her
                    expense, which meant coming from Europe, for which she was not reimbursed. Then
                    she was readmitted but there was the question of a job. It was only in Bonn
                    where this finally worked. I was head of the political section; she became head
                    of the consular section. So we were both section heads at the same embassy. That
                    was the first of four assignments - two abroad and two in Washington - where we
                    were together. Then our paths separated. At that time, luckily, our children
                    were already in boarding school. She was CG in Zurich. I was in the National
                    Intelligence Council. Then she was in a Washington job. Then she went to
                    Surinam. I was still in Washington. Then she was an inspector, which meant she
                    was not here much of the time. So we had about eight years when we were not in
                    the same place. It worked out for us in the end, because when she was out of the
                    Service our children were growing up. But today, it is a common phenomenon to
                    have tandem couples. They all face the same dilemmas that we had to face. How do
                    we square a marriage with the requirement of serving wherever you're sent? This
                    dilemma is not just characteristic of the Foreign Service. Today, you encounter
                    it everywhere, with two career marriages, in academic and in business life. It
                    makes things more complicated. At the same time, it provides more professional
                    opportunity, for the spouse - the female spouse in most cases. It is harder to
                    juggle family. It is easier because there are two incomes. It requires more
                    imagination to handle these situations. None of them is similar. In a talk I
                    gave to a high school a few months ago about NATO, I started by telling them,
                    “You high school kids are all going to face a world in which you will meet the
                    same issue that my wife and I had to deal with. You'll both be working when
                    you're married. How do you square that?” These 14- and 15- and 16-year olds
                    probably have long forgotten whatever I said about NATO, but they will not have
                    forgotten the point I made about the fact that they at some point are very
                    likely to be part of a tandem couple, if not in the Foreign Service, then in
                    life in general. AI looked around the cafeteria there that afternoon after
                    talking to a class, I saw as many women as men. Everybody is adjusting to these
                    new situations as best they can. I have no prescriptions or lessons to draw from
                    it, except that it is a good thing that there is equal opportunity? Most people
                    are capable enough to deal with the difficulties that that situation
                    entails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your wife was consul general in Milano?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: She was consul general in Zurich and in Milan. Milan was her last
                    post. Earlier, she was also DCM in Surinam. She had a number of other
                    assignments. She retired at exactly the same grade as I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself acting as a spouse in a post
                        abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>VAN HEUVEN: Milan was the only post where I accompanied my wife. When she was in
                    Surinam, I stayed in Washington. There would have been nothing to do for me in
                    Paramaribo. Moreover, I had work to do at RAND. When we went to Milan, I was
                    conscious that this time the shoe was on the other foot. In Geneva, I had been
                    DCM and, for nearly a year, Charge. My wife was the press officer. During the
                    day, she played that role. At night, she was the Charge's wife. This meant that
                    her whole social life was like mine, but her professional life was with
                    different people doing different things. She knew well how to maintain that
                    distinction. So in Milan, it was up to me to also make that distinction. Even
                    though I had been director of Western European Affairs and had often been to
                    Italy officially, I resolved that I would stay totally out of renewing or making
                    new contacts. So, I looked up nobody that I could have looked up. I excused
                    myself from all working breakfasts and working lunches, even though I was in the
                    residence. I would have my meals in another room. I did not sit in on any
                    working meetings at the residence. I did attend the dinners that we gave because
                    these were dinners with spouses. When we went out in the evening, I went along.
                    But as I went along, I found myself with all these people that she knew, and I
                    knew only vaguely, if at all. I kept myself out of any conversation on matters
                    having to do with Italy, or Milan, or northern Italian politics. I made one
                    exception. USIA arranged for me to speak at the University of Trieste and so I
                    gave a RAND-type lecture there, but I was advertised as somebody from RAND, not
                    as the husband of the CG. When we traveled around northern Italy, we were
                    treated like royalty. There was plenty of protocol. For me, it was a matter of
                    keeping my head down. That was the right way to go. It worked well for us in
                    Geneva. It worked well for us in Milan. It did require discipline on my part
                    because my appetite for what was going on was always there. But the best
                    compliment I got in the end was from the Admin Officer, Dan Piccuta. When we
                    left, he said, “Thanks. You could have been a real pain in the ass and you
                    weren't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is a good place to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Epilogue</p>
                <p>Reading this account a year after it was recorded, four themes emerge.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>One is the preoccupation during my career - indeed my life - with Germany. My
                    first encounter was on May 10, 1940, when German troops attacked the Netherlands
                    and I spent the first hours that day in a bomb shelter on our country property
                    in Huis ter Heide. Then followed five years of occupation, with its
                    progressively ugly, dangerous and, in one case, lethal effect on my extended
                    family, and on me. My direct interface with Germany continued in the sixties,
                    when for four years I functioned as the lawyer of the U.S. military government
                    in West Berlin. Subsequently, I worked cooperatively with German officials at
                    NATO, at the CCD in Geneva, and at the UN General Assembly. Then came another
                    three years of intensive involvement as Political Counselor at the Embassy in
                    Bonn, followed by frequent visits to Germany in an official capacity or as a
                    USIA-sponsored speaker, and ongoing contact with German officials and
                    foundations in Washington.</p>
                <p>During this lifetime of exposure to the German Question - the role of Germany in
                    Europe - in its many manifestations, my sentiments and opinions underwent a full
                    reversal, from instinctive animosity to support of - indeed admiration for -
                    German achievements. The Germany of today - whole, united, democratic, and free
                    - is the result of much effort and of the work of many hands. I feel good to
                    have been a part of that effort.</p>
                <p>The second theme is my exposure to the issue of world order. A product of the
                    Second World War, I have been an instinctive supporter of the United Nations
                    Charter and of the Organization. This international structure - including the
                    Specialized Agencies - seemed to me the way for the world to tackle the many
                    common tasks that lay ahead. Though the proceedings in the UN system produce
                    constant reminders of human imperfection, it has managed its way forward with
                    the help of many energetic men and women of goodwill, devoted to the common
                    good. The process did steadily define and establish standards of human behavior,
                    particularly in the field of human rights, often taking the U.S. Bill of Rights
                    as model. While violations do occur - occasionally even on a massive scale - the
                    world community has by and large adopted the new standards and seeks to
                    implement them. I look back on my involvement in this process at the General
                    Assembly and the UN Human Rights Commission with satisfaction.</p>
                <p>More problematic has been the issue of the maintenance of international peace and
                    security. Over time, events tempered my early idealistic confidence in the
                    efficacy of international law. However, the U.S.-led NATO effort to achieve
                    security, peace, freedom, and prosperity in Europe was a striking success and
                    validated the enormous effort that it required. I feel proud to have been part
                    of that effort. It fortified my belief in the imagination, largesse, and
                    strength of my adopted country and made me proud to be an American. But now new
                    dangers are taking the place of the old ones, and the world is faced again with
                    the challenge of security. It is my hope that, once again, the United States -
                    motivated by enlightened self-interest and characteristic energy and generosity
                    - can provide the global leadership to meet this new challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>The third theme is my lifelong fascination with Europe, the continent where I was
                    born and where I spent almost half of my personal and professional life. In my
                    lifetime, I have seen the dramatic and, to all evidence, permanent change from a
                    centuries-long pattern in which differences were settled by force of arms to one
                    of peaceful cooperation - albeit not without lively competition. The experiments
                    of the European Union and the common currency seem to have taken hold. The EU
                    will serve as the vehicle for bringing to bear the huge pool of talent and
                    energy of Europe's peoples to shape the continent and its role in the world. But
                    despite the successful drive to unity, I am ever more mindful that Europe's
                    diversity is the key to understanding Europe. So the question remains how Europe
                    will organize itself to draw strength from this diversity.</p>
                <p>The last theme is about the United States. Throughout my schooling and foreign
                    service career, I have benefitted tremendously from the company of motivated and
                    loyal colleagues. My years at the National Intelligence Council and at RAND also
                    brought me closer to the questions of how the Americans see the world, what role
                    they see for their country in shaping the future, and what matters to them. I
                    have become more aware of the inherent American tendencies over the last century
                    not to act abroad, or to act alone. But circumstances have forced the United
                    States to face challenges together with other peoples and other countries on an
                    enormous scale; and the U.S. has earned its spurs as a global leader.
                    Globalization will require the United States to continue to work with others.
                    Myths about American ignorance notwithstanding, Americans are comfortable with
                    and in the world. Their inherent optimism, organizational talents, and
                    pragmatism, properly led and forged in open debate, will be key tools for the
                    global tasks ahead.</p>
