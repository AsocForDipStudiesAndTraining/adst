                <p>Foreign Service Security Program and The Emergency &amp; Evacuation Program</p>
                <p>This report on the origins and early years of the US Department of State Foreign
                    Service Security Program is based on recollections of Norman V. Schute, a member
                    of the original group of officers recruited for the program. For background
                    purposes and of possible interest, I am a Stanford University graduate, class of
                    1938, majoring in political science and international relations with minors in
                    history and economics, and studied under Professor Graham H. Stuart who also
                    served as a consultant and a mediator in the Tacna Arica dispute between Peru
                    and Chile and authored many articles and an excellent textbook on American
                    Diplomatic and Consular Practice. With the rise of Hitler and Naziism events in
                    Europe, I was convinced that war was inevitable. In February 1940 I qualified
                    for flight training and reported to US Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida,
                    for training as an aviation cadet. Later, owing to visual problems, for example,
                    depth perception, which meant, in my case, that attempting to land 25 or 30 feet
                    above the deck was not conducive to one's longevity.</p>
                <p>I served as an operational intelligence officer on the staff of Commander South
                    Pacific or COMSOPAC as we say, under Admiral William “Bull” Halsey and carried
                    out duties at Commander Naval Bases forward area Guadalcanal in the Solomon
                    Islands in the early days of the war. After that short tour, I was transferred
                    to the Joint Intelligence Center at Commander-in-Chief Pacific under Admiral
                    Chester Nimitz at Pearl Harbor. Upon release from the Navy I was employed as a
                    Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assigned to one of the
                    two criminal divisions of the New York City field office for several months
                    until beginning my career with the US State Department Foreign Service. Owing to
                    my background, I was recruited as a Foreign Service Security Officer in the
                    newly established Foreign Service Security Program in March 1947. It took me
                    some 15 years to finally reach my original goal of serving as a Consul General
                    at the American Embassy Paris. I never really wanted to be an Ambassador, which
                    was heresy, but my staff was larger than those of most embassies and I was
                    deeply involved in Embassy operations in all areas.</p>
                <p>Now, on with the Program.</p>
                <p>Names of the various offices will be followed initially with their acronym in
                    capital letters.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>During the end of World War II and immediately thereafter, it was quite apparent
                    that the Germans had penetrated our missions and posts abroad. Not only in
                    Europe but in Latin America and Africa as well. During earlier times and
                    immediately after the war it was evident also that security of our establishment
                    was virtually non-existent and while some officers in the Department of State
                    vigorously supported establishment of a foreign service security program,
                    notably led by Ambassador Frederick B. Lyon as Director of the Office of
                    Controls, other old guard traditional diplomatic officers were strongly opposed.
                    The idea was repugnant to them. Appropriations for the program were diverted
                    twice to other departmental areas. Finally, I was informed, President Harry
                    Truman ordered the Department to proceed at once in establishing this new
                    program. In March 1947, 18 new personnel recruited by Robert Bannerman, the
                    Department's Chief of Security Personnel, reported for training and assignment
                    to major posts in Europe, the Middle East and the Philippines as attach�s and
                    assistant attach�s. Along with general lectures, part of the training included a
                    week at Camp Holabird near Baltimore, MD, at the US Army Counter-Intelligence
                    School which, for the most part, was redundant as all of us had served in the
                    intelligence during the war. One candidate, Alex Prengel, had been a
                    cryptographer stationed in England. The head of the Office of Controls was
                    Donald L. Nicholson, to whom we were ordered to report directly. Later, he was
                    followed by Jack Minor, Dennis Flynn, John Ford and E. Tomlin Bailey as
                    Directors of the Office.</p>
                <p>In the beginning there was very little direction. We investigated leads
                    concerning a few local employees' political orientation thought to have been
                    under the influence of Russian, communist or German influence. After a number of
                    months a format was sent out from the newly established Office of Security (SY)
                    providing an outline for conducting surveys of posts in our area of
                    responsibility covering physical, procedural, personnel and technical aspects of
                    security.</p>
                <p>In August 1947 I was posted to our legation in Stockholm and Helsinki. Not long
                    after, both were raised to Embassy status. From the beginning, I and most of my
                    colleagues at other posts were somewhat handicapped by administrative officers
                    who attempted to supervise our work, much of which was sensitive and none of
                    their concern. Our investigations consisted mainly of file checks through the
                    CIA Chief of Station who had liaison with local intelligence and political
                    authorities, and, interviews in background checks. Since I was on good terms
                    with my Ambassador, H. Freeman Matthews, and Deputy Chief of Mission, Hugh S.
                    Cumming, Jr., and most of the staff was being replaced with new officers, I
                    could pretty well cope with the situation, but from time to time I was given
                    initial assignments such as conducting a Cost of Living survey and preparing an
                    emergency and evacuation plan, a newly established requirement of foreign
                    service posts due to the Soviet Russian deteriorating relations with the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The lowering of the Iron Curtain, a term coined by British Prime Minister Sir
                    Winston Churchill in a speech delivered in Missouri, and start of the Cold War
                    in 1948 gave urgency to this new program. Meanwhile I managed to improve
                    procedures in document handling. Instead of routing classified documents via
                    non-US citizen messengers from one office to the next or file room, I managed to
                    get American secretaries to deliver these classified documents, telegrams and
                    memoranda themselves - much to their chagrin and irritation. During the period
                    of my two year tour, the Embassy was located in a large old stone building on
                    Strandvagen 7A opposite the Royal Palace, across a small bay. The code room
                    shared a wall with the rest of the building which was a pension. Although I
                    could detect no listening devices with my elementary scanner, I had carpet
                    installed to dampen the sound of our antiquated code machine. A one-time pad
                    code book was used for highly sensitive messages. It was not possible to move
                    this nerve center to a secure area. The telephone system, too, was antiquated.
                    It wasn't until early 1949 the Communications Supervisor for Europe, William P.
                    Richmond working in close contact with the Chief of State Department
                    Communications, an ex-RCA executive, that a new telephone switchboard system was
                    installed which at least assured some degree of internal privacy and security.
                    Most classified documents were stored in simple key lock steel file cabinets and
                    a few combination lock safes which could easily be manipulated by a
                    professional. There were no overnight guards. Except in Helsinki, the guard was
                    a local employee, a Finn, of course, had access to everything in the building.
                    Only at larger missions were American civilian guards on off-hours duty.</p>
                <p>Another problem was that many of our recommendations required support of the
                    various State Department Regional Bureaus. For example, the Bureau of European
                    Affairs (EUR), of American Republics (ARA), of Far Eastern Affairs (FE), Near
                    East and African Affairs (NEA). Africa became a separate bureau in about 1958,
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>And support usually meant an allotment of funds and that very little, if any were
                    available. This state of affairs finally came to a head in mid-1948 and a
                    conference was held at our embassy in Paris the end of June or early July in
                    1948 for one week under the Chairmanship of Admiral Will D. Wright, US Navy
                    (Ret.). It was generally agreed that security was rather repugnant to many
                    members of the Service who felt we were snooping on their work and their person
                    which was totally untrue. Many cooperated, but many did not. The result was to
                    regionalize the program and establish the regional security headquarters for
                    Europe at American Embassy, London, under the chairmanship of William B. Hussey
                    as Regional Security Supervisor (RSS) and five RSO officers who were Paul Green,
                    Felix Verity, Laurence Gruza, Gerry Rothlein, myself and two American
                    secretaries. Resident Security Officers were stationed at London, Frankfurt,
                    Rome and Cairo. Our mission was to visit all consular and embassies to conduct
                    surveys and write reports with recommendations for improving security. These
                    were forwarded to the post with copies to the Regional Bureaus and the Bureau of
                    Security and Consular Affairs, our bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>A full blown detailed outline covering the four basic areas of procedural,
                    physical, technical and personnel security had been prepared in the Office of
                    the Controls, now named the Office of Security (SY), an office in the Bureau of
                    Security and Consular Affairs, and we were now on our way. SCA could now bring
                    pressure to bear on regional bureaus to support our recommendations.</p>
                <p>I conducted surveys of the constituent post in England and of the I.G. Farben
                    building in Frankfurt, headquarters of the High Commissioner, and embassies in
                    Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Vienna and Bern. During this period, arrangements were
                    made by the Department with the US Marine Corps to staff embassies and large
                    consular posts, e.g. the Consulate General in Naples in Italy, with Marine
                    Security Guards. In mid-1950 I was transferred to the Rome Embassy as resident
                    or Regional Security Officer with responsibilities also for covering our posts
                    of Milan, Genoa, Florence, Naples, Bari and Palermo. Work went more smoothly
                    here and I reported to the Deputy Chief of Mission Llewellyn E. Thompson, later
                    Ambassador to Moscow, and prudently kept the administrative officer, Gaze Lucas,
                    generally informed of my work, always bearing in mind the principle of “need to
                    know,” the fundamental tenet of basic security.</p>
                <p>In late 1952, I was transferred to Mexico City and carried on pretty much the
                    same as I had in Rome as Regional Security Supervisor until transferred to
                    Washington in the Department's Office of Security in the Physical Security
                    Section (SY/P as we called it). In addition to basic four areas of security,
                    there were also a technical laboratory, a protection unit for official visitors
                    and a highly specialized office staffed by two officers, Fred Traband and Paul
                    Clarke, dealing with personnel cases. During this tour, I was assigned to
                    provide protection services in cooperation with the Office of Protocol during
                    the visits of Queen Elizabeth and King Saud of which more later.</p>
                <p>Finally, in March 1958 after much bureaucratic maneuvering, good timing and good
                    luck I was able to obtain reassignment to the Bureau of Near Eastern and African
                    Affairs as a Supervisory Administrative Officer of the near eastern desk. Now I
                    was in the real Foreign Service. In simple terms I was in charge of the
                    logistical support of our foreign service establishments in the Near East. It
                    was an interesting, rewarding, learning experience but exceedingly difficult in
                    the beginning. The preparation of budget spreads, administering personnel
                    support and general services support is an exceedingly complex matter in the
                    State Department. Very soon, we were all in the NEA Bureau began to have
                    problems. Emergencies were popping up in Beirut, Lebanon, and Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
                <p>Owing to my earlier experience in E &amp; E, emergency and evacuation planning, I
                    was spending more time in the main State building in the Office of the Executive
                    Director for the Bureau, preparing summaries of the communications traffic and
                    liaising with the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs on emergency planning.
                    This led to the latter office requesting my reassignment to them to which I
                    happily concurred.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The subject of emergency and evacuation planning, its origins and development
                    from 1948 to 1962 is contained in a separate report, but for now the following
                    are some nitty gritty highlights of the early Foreign Service Security
                    Program.</p>
                <p>With regard to the physical and technical security, we found on opening our
                    embassies in Europe, temporary quarters were usually leased until we could
                    obtain more adequate quarters or build our own. In Warsaw we occupied a former
                    convent undamaged by bombing near the heart of the old city. When I surveyed the
                    quarters in 1950, a number of pock marks in the walls the size of a soft
                    baseball could readily be noted. Each hole was the location of a microphone our
                    technical people had discovered and removed. In the 1950s after repeated visits,
                    much research and refinement of equipment of technical security officers Bob
                    Anderson and Joe Bezjian, two unusually gifted people, finally discovered the
                    location of a Russian microphone in our Ambassador John Cabot Lodge's office.
                    The Soviet Russian government had thoughtfully presented the Ambassador for his
                    office, a replica of the United States Seal, beautifully carved in wood
                    approximately two feet in diameter. It was skillfully constructed of two pieces,
                    front and back, in the center of which a small two-three inch opening contained
                    a what is known as a resonant cavity microphone equipped with a short six-eight
                    inch antenna. The Ambassador's voice could be picked up several floors above his
                    in the building attic where Anderson and Bezjian first heard him talking.</p>
                <p>The moral here is that one should always look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>
                <p>The whole building was later found to be riddled with microphones. Plans were
                    quickly developed for a new building to be constructed under US supervision.
                    Visitor control, too, was a problem. Consular operations obviously require the
                    public's access and most embassies had these activities on the ground floor.
                    Separating visa applicants and others seeking consular services from other areas
                    of the embassy required installing extra doors and blocked passageways. As for
                    procedural or document control, higher classifications of documents were
                    registered and numbered. American staff members were impressed with their
                    obligations to properly handle and store classified materials in safes equipped
                    with manipulation proof combination locks. During non-business hours the Marine
                    guards conducted a security check of each office. If any classified material was
                    left out or in desk drawers, they would pick up the material and leave a
                    security violation notice to be filed in the offender's personnel file. This
                    procedure markedly improved procedural security awareness in the Service.</p>

                <p>Finally we come to the personnel aspects of foreign service security. One does
                    not have to be a world famous psychoanalyst to understand that two driving
                    forces in human nature are sex and greed but mostly sex. Polish intelligence was
                    most adept at personnel penetrations. One of our married officers became
                    enamored of a Polish female intelligence operative. After investigation he
                    confessed and was sent to prison. The wife of another officer became the target
                    of the amorous attention of a male intelligence officer. On learning that his
                    real intentions and real interest was not love but information she could
                    provide, before becoming entrapped, she informed her husband and they were
                    transferred to another post.</p>
                <p>In Budapest an attach� met one of the famous “Duna” girls who were very
                    attractive, intellectually and physically, at an official reception. When
                    invited to her home for the night, he eagerly accepted. Several days later he
                    received a Hungarian visitor at his office in the embassy who displayed to him a
                    number of pictures at various angles of his activities with the young lady in
                    bed and suggested that he cooperate. The attach�, being no fool, informed his
                    chief and was transferred back to the U.S. within a few days.</p>
                <p>In the trade it is called a double penetration but it didn't work.</p>
                <p>Homosexuality in the Service has always been a problem. I voice no personal
                    opinion on this. Basically, officially it is believed that homosexuality can
                    lead to the compromise of U.S. Government security. Both German and Soviet
                    intelligence use homosexuals to establish a close relationship with homosexuals
                    in other countries' services including our own. Those who cohabited on the
                    outside were developed into informants by their lovers. Others were or were
                    likely to become targets for blackmail and thence informants. Traitor is another
                    term used for it. Back in 1946 as I recall, it was the aforementioned Ed Thomas
                    who had to inform Secretary of State Cordell Hull that a very senior officer had
                    been arrested for pederasty in Lafayette Park. In Rome, two of my colleagues
                    after interviews confessed and were released from the Service. Three members of
                    the original Foreign Service Security group were reported to be deviants and on
                    interview were promptly released. And in 1947 before our conference, Foreign
                    Service Chief Inspector Merle Cochran, later an Ambassador, sent home seven
                    communications personnel, a veritable “daisy and chain” as it is known. And
                    that's the way it is, or at least was, in my day.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>On a happier note, I mentioned earlier about being assigned protection protocol
                    duties for the visit of Queen Elizabeth and of King Saud, both of which occurred
                    in 1957. The Queen's visit to the United States was to lay the corner stone for
                    the new addition to the British Embassy in Washington, DC, and I was assigned
                    two or three events that took place at the British Embassy. One was a garden
                    party held outside with large canopies to protect from the sun and then a State
                    dinner attended by the President of the United States and of course, Secretary
                    of State. It was a fascinating exercise and then following these activities the
                    next day I escorted up Massachusetts Avenue, Her Majesty and Prince Philip to
                    the corner and around and back to the building site where the corner stone was
                    and she of course with the trowel tapped on some cement, thereby making it
                    officially laid. During those days and for those duties we all carried weapons.
                    Having been with the FBI I had some skill in handling a weapon and was an
                    instructor for some of the other fellows. I can't say that they were marksmen,
                    but in any event, as I say it was an interesting and a wonderful honor for
                    me.</p>
                <p>The King Saud thing was really an Arabian Knights affair. I was assigned to
                    escort the little Prince, the Royal Protector and the Royal Nurse. I met them at
                    the ship and took them to their hotel. I'd get them up in the morning and put
                    them to bed at night. Later on, from New York we went to Washington and Blair
                    House which is the official residence for official visitors, was completely
                    occupied by King Saud and his entourage. As I recall, in addition to the little
                    Prince, King Saud had so many wives and of course, many children. I believe he
                    brought over four or five adult Princes and each night one of my colleagues
                    would carry a large packet of money and one of them particularly would go to
                    Baltimore and visit the ladies of the evening. They seemed to prefer blondes,
                    brunettes and red heads. My assignment was, I believe, much more interesting and
                    fascinating. The little Prince apparently had a muscular ailment in his left or
                    right ankle so we made a number of visits to Walter Reed hospital where he was
                    given hydrotherapy and then, of course, visits to the zoo and I have a few
                    pictures of it which are nice memories tucked away. Finally things were drawing
                    to a close. My colleagues and I, individually, were directed to report to a room
                    where assistants of the King gave presents of money and watches. At that point
                    they had run out of the official watches which were gold Longines watches with
                    the King Saud's crest, crossed swords and a palm, in a presentation box. So they
                    went downtown and picked up a lot of Gruens and Hamiltons. I showed the little
                    Prince my watch and he sort of shook his head and ran back into the bedroom. On
                    return he gave me one of the Longines. I also received four $100 bills. Well, of
                    course, no government employee is supposed to accept any gifts so I promptly
                    prepared a memo and turned in the four $100 bills and I listed them by serial
                    number. My Chief, then Tomlin Bailey, wasn't too happy that I'd put this all in
                    writing, but it was a matter of personal protection, I felt, and it just would
                    hold the next person accountable for receiving it. Of course, I turned in the
                    watch but sometime later the Chief of Protocol, Wiley Buchanan, said that these
                    “mickey mouse” watches, as he called them, should be returned and that's how
                    I've got this very nice watch.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In closing I would add finally that anyone wishing detail or elaboration may feel
                    free to contact our leader of this project, Director Charles Stuart Kennedy, who
                    can supply my home phone number, but don't wait too long. I am getting long in
                    the tooth and one never knows, does one?</p>

                <p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE EMERGENCY &amp; EVACUATION PROGRAM (E &amp; E
                    Program)</p>
                <p>This report was prepared by Norman V. Schute,Foreign Service Officer, Retired</p>
                <p>With the onset of the Cold War in 1947-1948, U.S. State Department officials were
                    concerned for the safety of U.S. citizens in Europe in case relations between
                    the Soviet Union and the western powers deteriorated.</p>
                <p>In 1948, the Washington Liaison Group (WLG), a Committee of State, Joint Chief of
                    Staff, Army, Navy and Air Force representatives, chaired by the State Department
                    representative, was formed to develop plans for the protection of U.S. citizens
                    and the nationals of certain other friendly countries in an emergency and, if
                    necessary, their evacuation to a safe haven or the United States. Welfare and
                    Protection has always been a Consular function, but this was on a much grander
                    scale.</p>
                <p>The first Chairman, Edwin J. Madill, Special Assistant to the Administrator of
                    the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs (SCA) (the administrator had the
                    same rank as an Assistant Secretary of State) and he immediately set out to
                    introduce and explain the requirements of the Program to all of the Chiefs of
                    Mission in Europe in the Spring of 1948.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador to Sweden, H. Freeman Matthews, was most supportive of this
                    planning and I was directed by my Chief, Hugh S. Cumming, Jr., then Counselor of
                    Embassy (and later an Ambassador), to take on this planning as an additional
                    duty while I was stationed in Stockholm.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, E&amp;E planning was not considered a “main stream” activity
                    in the Foreign Service, meaning you don't make “brownie points” toward your
                    career, i.e., promotions (the same held true for Security Officer) in carrying
                    out such responsibilities...but...I believed in it wholeheartedly and
                    immediately plunged into drawing up plans which then were relatively simple
                    owing to our geographic position and Sweden's policy of neutrality in any major
                    conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>An emergency could be either a local one which involved danger to American
                    citizens in the event of civil war, a revolt against the government in power, a
                    natural disaster, or political/military strife, or, a general emergency which
                    involved the movement of Russian Soviet armed forces into western Europe.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Department established liaison groups, staffed by a Chairman and
                    Assistant Chairman to assist posts in their area in drawing up plans and
                    assuring coordination with other posts in their area in the event of an
                    emergency.</p>
                <p>These liaison groups were established at London (LLG), Paris (PLG), Rome (RLG,
                    Dhahran (DLG) and Manila (MLG).</p>
                <p>Mr. Madill deserves more than kudos for his outstanding work in getting the
                    program established.</p>
                <p>In 1950 after a one-year assignment in London as a Regional Security Officer, I
                    was assigned to Rome in the same capacity but again with the additional duty of
                    Chairman of the Rome Liaison Group (RLG) covering Italy, Spain, Greece and our
                    North African post. There was little support for the program and action
                    consisted mainly of handling correspondence with posts in my area to assure
                    coordination of any possible movement to safe havens or the United States.</p>
                <p>Then, in mid-1952 I was transferred to our Embassy in Mexico City as Regional
                    Security Supervisor and while I was not responsible, it was quite clear that
                    given our proximity to the United States, very little interest, much less
                    action, was directed to E&amp;E Planning.</p>
                <p>After my assignment to the Department in 1955 and later taking up duties as
                    Supervisory Administrative Officer in the Near East and African Bureau (NEA),
                    local emergencies in Bolivia, Paraguay, Lebanon, Baghdad and Cuba finally
                    attracted the serious interest of the Department in E&amp;E Planning. During the
                    Cuban crisis, Charles E. Higdon, Executive Director of Latin American Republics
                    (ARA) and myself, were directed to prepare a new format for the steps, or
                    actions, to be taken by posts in an emergency.</p>
                <p>Basically, the format consisted of four (4) phases which are summarized in the
                    following:</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>With the outbreak of serious unrest locally, Phase 1, after consultation with the
                    Department, could be declared and government dependents (i.e., spouses and
                    children) could be sent to a safe haven (e.g., from Lebanon to Greece or Rome).
                    Other American citizens (i.e., businessmen and tourists) would be urged to leave
                    through individual notices and committees formed in the local American
                    community. Post activities would be reviewed and where possible, reduced; Phase
                    2 required a review of post's activities, which ones to discontinue, and
                    transfer non-essential personnel to a safe haven. Also, warn American citizens
                    and assist them as necessary to leave the country; Phase 3, reduce staff further
                    and burn all sensitive documents; Phase 4, reduce staff to Chief of Mission,
                    Deputy Chief of Mission and one or two assistants, complete burning of
                    classified documents and close the post. Under international law, all diplomatic
                    personnel are required to be provided safe conduct departure by the host
                    country, a requirement not always observed e.g. the violation of our Embassy and
                    personnel in Tehran.</p>
                <p>About this time, Scott McLeod, Administrator of SCA and his Deputy, Harris Huston
                    (both political appointees), took an active interest in the Program. The
                    political situation in Cuba was heating up with Castro's advance from Santiago
                    in the south on up toward Havana and eventual overthrow of the Batista
                    government.</p>
                <p>In late 1957 a new Chairman of WLG, Walter H. Mueller, immediately plunged into
                    his duties. Owing to my background in E&amp;E planning, he asked me to be his
                    Deputy. Walter made a tremendous contribution in formalizing procedures for the
                    Program and in gaining proper respect and support for it. Walter visited all of
                    the LGS and a large number of posts in Europe, Africa, Middle and Far East
                    reviewing plans while I held the fort, so to speak, in the Department.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Mueller's appointment as Chairman, the government in Baghdad was
                    overthrown, the royal family slaughtered and mobs over-ran the city. A number of
                    Americans were killed, hundreds of Americans sought refuge in hotels, their
                    homes and any other shelters they could find. Hundreds of these people were
                    tourists who had arrived on charter flights, and, the airport was closed. But
                    even if it were open, airlines would not fly into the city without guarantee of
                    safety by the government in power.</p>
                <p>Walter and his assistant made an unauthorized command decision and guaranteed
                    Pan-American Airways their costs to provide transportation for all those
                    Americans wishing to leave.</p>
                <p>An important lesson was learned here. No one, or airplane, enters or leaves a
                    country unless the controlling governmental forces of that country permits
                    it.</p>
                <p>Pan-American provided three planes, as I recall, which landed in Ankara, Turkey
                    to await authorization by authorities in Baghdad which, while not entirely
                    stabilized, had some semblance of control.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>At first they said only one plane per week could enter, pick up our citizens, and
                    safely fly out! Our Embassy officers worked very, very hard in persuading the
                    Baghdadis to permit more flights and after extending it to three flights a week,
                    Monday, Wednesday and Friday, finally agreed to permit one daily flight until
                    all who wished to leave could do so.</p>
                <p>A side light here is of interest. If the charter flights were unable to carry out
                    their contracts, the passengers were out of luck. The State Department does not,
                    or did not then, have funds to provide emergency transportation for American
                    citizens in such cases. So...all passengers agreed to re-pay the U.S. Government
                    for return transportation. Years later, I learned that a large number of those
                    evacuees never did pay for this obligation totaling many thousands of
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>Toward the middle of 1959, Castro took over the government of Cuba. In Havana,
                    crowds of over 100,000 people raptly listened to him speak for hours on end. We
                    in the Department were deeply concerned that the mobs, with feelings at fever
                    pitch, would attack our citizens. Fortunately, Castro had strong control, but we
                    were still worried.</p>
                <p>A top-level emergency conference was initiated by the Department to discuss the
                    situation. This meeting was attended by Secretary of State Christian Herter, the
                    Admiral who was Chief of the Joint Chief of Staff, armed force representatives
                    and myself as acting Chief of WLG, in the absence of Walter Mueller who was in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>We each presented our views of the situation. Mr. Herter then asked if we could
                    pinpoint the location of our people, American citizens that is, and I replied in
                    the affirmative. He then asked the Admiral if we had pinpoint plans to rescue
                    our people.</p>
                <p>The silence was deafening! After a moment or two of recovery, the Admiral
                    responded in the negative, but that he would develop them at once.</p>
                <p>Fortunately it was not necessary to implement such plans.</p>
                <p>Baghdad and Havana taught us another lesson. There was an overwhelming need for
                    shortwave communications equipment at many of our Foreign Service posts.</p>
                <p>In October 1959, a State-Army conference on E&amp;E planning was held in
                    Frankfurt attended by top ranking military officials of the U.S. European
                    command, Deputy Administrator Harris Huston, Walter Mueller, Chairman of WLG and
                    myself. The military had thousands of dependent personnel and, as always,
                    budgeted for funds and developed plans for their evacuation via convoy west
                    through France to the Iberian peninsula. Logistic support, e.g. gasoline, food
                    etc., was stored at specified places along the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We, too, had plans but no funds for logistic support, although we had established
                    safe havens at Camp Kagnew in Ethiopia and in Portugal equipped with folding
                    beds and other necessary facilities.</p>
                <p>The military took extremely strong objection to Huston's statement that our
                    people, the non-military U.S. citizens, would join their caravans. The
                    conference ended on a rather sour note.</p>
                <p>On leaving Frankfurt, Harris Huston, Mueller and myself traveled to London to
                    discuss planning with British Foreign Office officials.</p>
                <p>The result was to mark a turning point in State Department E&amp;E planning.</p>
                <p>The British informed us they would, of could, not discuss General Emergency
                    planning with us because there would be no movement of civilians, that they
                    would stand fast and make no attempt to leave their cities and homes.</p>
                <p>We readily adopted Stand Fast in our planning for a General Emergency.</p>
                <p>One big asset to our program was obtaining an allotment of confidential funds to
                    purchase emergency communications equipment: Collins single sideband short wave
                    transmitters. They were small and portable and were shipped to all potential hot
                    spots in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>A new Administrator, John Hanes, a no-nonsense practical leader gave strong
                    support to our work which was important to us vis-a-vis the other bureaus.</p>
                <p>We also proceeded to revise and update the E&amp;E Manual and prepare a new one
                    of action for the Department to take in support. They were simple and concise
                    consisting of only 20 or so pages in outline form. Both were cleared by the
                    various Bureaus and other interested areas.</p>
                <p>In mid-1960 I was transferred to Paris as Chairman of PLG just as the Belgian
                    Congo blew up. It was rough in the back country.</p>
                <p>American missionaries and medical personnel were being hacked to death and in
                    some cases eaten! Time magazine reports were true. There were about 200 of these
                    people, and others registered in the Embassy's Consular Section. Actually, we
                    found there were about 2,000 in the bush! Fortunately, the radio equipment we
                    had sent enabled Ambassador Clare Timberlake to transmit messages to the Embassy
                    in Brazzaville, across the Congo River, where Consul Alan W. Lukens (later
                    Ambassador) could relay Timberlake's report to us at PLG in Paris and we would
                    inform the Department by telephone.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>U.S. Air Force planes were ferrying equipment and supplies to Leopoldville in
                    support of the local government. As always, our military gave massive support by
                    carrying our refugees back to safety, landing at Evreux, France, a NATO U.S. Air
                    Force base. There, they were provided overnight accommodations and food and in
                    the morning transport to a nearby French railway station for onward movement by
                    train to Paris.</p>
                <p>Since almost all of these people had to be approved and processed in Belgium
                    before going to the Congo to carry out their missionary and medical duties,
                    arrangements were made with Belgian Red Cross representatives to provide the
                    railway transportation without charge.</p>
                <p>My assistant and I would meet these people at Gare San Lazare and ask if they
                    wished to return to Belgium or return to the United States.</p>
                <p>Many preferred to go to Belgium hoping to wait out the storm and return to the
                    Congo. But many wanted to return to the U.S.</p>
                <p>I persuaded many of the latter to loan money to their friends for lodgings in
                    little hotels near the station. I had far less luck in requesting an allotment
                    of funds from the Department for loans to those wishing to go home. Finally, we
                    persuaded U.S. Airlines to accept promissory notes. This unfortunately was a
                    source of embarrassment since many refused to repay these loans later on the
                    grounds that the Ambassador, Timberlake, “had ordered them to leave the
                    country!”</p>
                <p>After this, I visited all of our posts in western and eastern Europe, except
                    Moscow, Bucharest and Dublin, as also our post in North Africa, reviewing plans,
                    and consulting on improvements.</p>
                <p>In mid-1961 PLG headquarters in Paris was moved to Frankfurt. A new Chairman,
                    Merrill Hammond, a political appointee, was appointed and I reverted to
                    Deputy.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately he knew nothing of the program. I briefed him each morning and in
                    the afternoon he would send me memoranda directing me to carry out the
                    suggestions I had given him in the morning.</p>
                <p>Ever since the meeting with our British opposites, I finally arrived at the
                    conclusion that the E&amp;E program could be centered in the Department. It had
                    gone full circle.</p>
                <p>In June 1962, while on consultation in the Department, I recommended that the
                    General Emergency safe havens be abolished, that my position be abolished, that
                    PLG be abolished and the whole program be centered in the Department of State's
                    Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>This was favorably acted upon. After home leave, I was assigned to Oslo as Chief
                    of Consular Services, after which I was assigned to Paris as Consul General.</p>
                <p>Walter Mueller was assigned to St. John, New Brunswick, Canada, as Consul General
                    and his duties as Chairman PLG were taken over by James MacDonald, an excellent
                    administrator.</p>
                <p>I retired in 1973. Since then I've been engaged in a spate of community
                    activities and occasionally give talks on the Foreign Service and Emergency
                    Planning. In the latter I stress the fact that no funds are provided by the U.S.
                    government for the travel of U.S. citizens abroad in an emergency and they
                    should be made aware of that.</p>
                <p>Yours truly, [signed] Norman V. Schute.</p>
                <p>N.B. Ambassador Lukens returned to the Department after retirement to serve as a
                    consultant on E&amp;E matters, visiting Middle East and Southeast Asia posts.
                    The current E&amp;E manual is now the size of a telephone book!</p>
