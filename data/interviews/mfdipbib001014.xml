                <p>Interviewed by: Richard L. Jackson</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 30, 1998</p>
                <p>Copyright 2002 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This will be an oral history interview with Mr. Carl Salans, conducted in
                    Paris on December 30, 1998 by Richard Jackson. Mr. Salans, I see that you were
                    in the Department of State from '59 to '72. Before we get to that, could you
                    tell us a little bit about how you came to join the State Department, whether
                    that came from your education and how you got interested in foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>SALANS: Yes, my interest in foreign affairs goes back to my days in high school.
                    I had a history teacher who was an inspiration to me, Miss Margaret Norman, I
                    still remember. We together started something called the Forty-nine Club, which
                    was an international relations club. At that time there were 49 countries in the
                    United Nations. I went on to Harvard College where I studied international
                    relations and political science and to law school where I majored in
                    international law at Cambridge University, Trinity College, in England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The high school where you first got interested, what part
                        of thcountry was that in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:It was Bloom Township High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. I think I
                    was the first student from that high school that ever went out of state to
                    college which shows you the kind of community I grew up in. It was unusual to
                    have an interest in international relations coming from a community like that, a
                    small industrial town. But, as I say, there was this teacher who was herself
                    interested in the subject and got me interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in the years after the UN had burst on the
                        scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes. It was in the aftermath of W.W.II and the creation of the United
                    Nations. The beginning of the role of the United States as a major influence in
                    international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any influence of Adlai Stevenson coming from
                        Illinois?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SALANS: Adlai Stevenson of Illinois was one of my heroes. Yes, all of that I am
                    sure had played a part. The fact that my parents were born in Europe and
                    emigrated to the United States also created an interest. In any case, the
                    interest persisted when I went to law school, particularly when I went to
                    Cambridge. I focused principally on international law studies and public
                    international law in particular, which itself was not a usual course of study
                    for a young lawyer in those days. Maybe even today it is not a usual course of
                    study. But, that was my interest; I pursued it. When I came out of law school,
                    there weren't very many places where one could practice public international
                    law. One of those places was the Legal Advisor's office of the State Department.
                    Other places that came to my attention were international organizations that
                    were created in the aftermath of the creation of the United Nations. I was
                    interested in Paris. I was interested in UNESCO. At that time I applied for a
                    job there, but I was persuaded by the people I had met in the State Department
                    that I had better have a good grounding in my own legal system before going to
                    work in an international organization. I followed that advice, and I accepted a
                    job in the Legal Advisors office in the State Department. That must have been in
                    1959 in the last years of the Eisenhower administration. My first assignment in
                    the Legal Advisor's office was in the Office of Far Eastern Affairs where I
                    worked for the then assistant legal advisor for Far Eastern Affairs whose name
                    was Eli Maurer. In that job, I was introduced to all of the problems of
                    Southeast Asia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam in particular, to U.S.-Japan relations,
                    in particular American-Japanese security arrangements, to U.S.-China relations,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Travel out to the region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:I did not travel out to the region at that stage. I was a youngster and
                    pretty much stayed at home. Although, in 1962, I did travel to Geneva for the
                    international conference on Laos with Averell Harriman and was the legal advisor
                    to the delegation for part of the time of that conference. That was the
                    conference in which the 1962 Geneva Agreements neutralizing Laos were negotiated
                    and signed. But, I did not travel to Southeast Asia itself.</p>
                <p>Q: So what was it like as a young recent employee being advisor to Averell
                    Harriman at a conference like that? What kind of a person was he?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SALANS:I had a great admiration for Governor Harriman and kind of followed him
                    around throughout my career. He was someone who was so devoted to his country.
                    He was a man of principle, I thought, whom one couldn't help but admire, whether
                    one agreed with him all the time or not. I tended to share his views on many
                    things. He was kind enough during his time in the State Department to seek my
                    advice on many occasions. I think he became Assistant Secretary of State for Far
                    Eastern Affairs at one point if I am not mistaken. Later when he was Ambassador
                    to the Vietnam talks together with Cyrus Vance, he sought me out and asked me to
                    join the U.S. delegation in Paris. I think I had a very close and warm
                    relationship with him which to me as a youngster, I still thought of myself as a
                    youngster in those days, was very exciting. I felt it was an honor really to
                    work for a man like that. He and Cyrus Vance were two people I admired very much
                    in my time in the State Department and for whom I enjoyed working immensely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have worked in Geneva very closely drafting with
                        him ancoming up with the framework for those agreements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes. The essential role of the lawyer in that negotiation was A. drafting
                    agreements, B. bringing to the attention of the people in the delegation the
                    relevance to any new negotiation or new agreement of the 1954 Geneva agreements
                    which had been negotiated also in Geneva and which were the result of the French
                    withdrawal from Southeast Asia. There was a whole legal framework within which
                    Southeast Asia was operating starting from 1954 until 1962 and later until the
                    Vietnam conference, which was relevant to any new agreements that would be
                    negotiated. One of the roles of the lawyer was to be thoroughly familiar with
                    those agreements, how they had operated in practice, what the institutions that
                    had been created by those agreements had done, and how they functioned, and all
                    of that. The lawyer brought it to the attention of Governor Harriman and the
                    other members of the delegation who may not have been as familiar with that
                    history and legal framework as the lawyers were. Governor Harriman also liked
                    the way I drafted, and looked to me very often at that conference, but more so
                    later at the Vietnam peace talks, to draft the policy statements that he would
                    make in plenary sessions or other statements. I became kind of a draftsman for
                    him, which went beyond the normal role of a lawyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some other State Department people from
                        differenbureaus on the delegation or the Vietnam negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes. The person I remember best from the Laos conference is Bill Sullivan
                    who later became Ambassador to I'm not sure what country in Southeast Asia
                    (Laos?).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in Iran wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, you are right. He ended up as Ambassador in Iran. He was I think the
                    principal political advisor to Harriman at the Laos conference. Again, at that
                    point, Bill Sullivan was a relatively young man, 1962. He was older than I was.
                    He was not a senior Foreign Service officer, but Governor Harriman took a liking
                    to him too, and Harriman had people he liked and relied on, and there were
                    people he thought were terrible whom he didn't want to listen to. Bill Sullivan
                    was a person he liked very much and relied on very much. I remember, therefore,
                    working closely with Bill Sullivan during that conference and subsequently in
                    the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs in the State Department after the Laos
                    conference was over.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, spanning the years you were in the legal office, Vietnam must have been
                    a particular focus. I don't know if you watched that at all.</p>
                <p>SALANS:In the first years from 1959 until 1962 or 1963, I am not sure exactly,
                    sometime in that era, as I explained earlier, I started off as a junior lawyer
                    in the Assistant Legal Advisors office for Far Eastern Affairs. After two or
                    three years, I became the Assistant Legal Advisor for Far Eastern Affairs. In
                    1963 or '64, I became the Assistant Legal Advisor for Inter-American
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The two together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:No, I left the Far East and began to work on Inter-American Affairs. But,
                    during the first period of four or five years when I was in the office of the
                    Far Eastern Affairs. Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, Thailand as well, became
                    principal areas of activity for me, though there were other interesting things
                    that were happening during that period which I worked on that I remember,
                    particularly United States relations with Japan. In the aftermath of the war in
                    the late 1950's, the United States was negotiating a security treaty with Japan.
                    I participated in the drafting of the security treaty, the status of forces
                    agreement that regulated the basing of United States forces in Japan,
                    negotiations over the status of the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa).
                    The Japanese badly wanted Okinawa back, and the United States finally
                    reluctantly agreed to return Okinawa to the Japanese. That was a difficult and
                    elaborate and long negotiation I participated in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reversion was in those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SALANS:It must have been. My memory is not altogether clear, but I know that was
                    one of the principal issues that I worked on. I think the reversion was in those
                    years, and if it wasn't in those years, it was immediately after. Another area
                    that I worked on at that time was, I'm not sure whether it was the creation, but
                    it was the early days of the organization of SEATO, the Southeast Asian Treaty
                    Organization. The negotiation of that treaty and the carrying out of the treaty,
                    advising what the treaty meant both vis a vis Congress and vis a vis the other
                    parties to the agreement. It was also something that I played a role in and that
                    was also a principal focus of those days. I can't remember in terms of time
                    whether it was in those days when I was Assistant Legal Advisor for Far Eastern
                    Affairs, or whether it was later in my career when I became Deputy Legal
                    Advisor, that I traveled with Secretary Rusk to the Far East, to Japan, to the
                    Philippines for meetings of SEATO nations. I did do that at some point in my
                    career either in those days or later as I say when I became Deputy Legal
                    Advisor. The whole problem of the United States' relations with China, the
                    recognition or non-recognition of China, relations with and the defense of
                    Formosa or Taiwan were issues in those days. I was deeply involved in that
                    because I remember very well, I became not so much a lawyer as a politician,
                    feeling strongly that the United States' non-recognition of the Peoples Republic
                    of China didn't make any sense either as a legal matter or as a matter of
                    political reality. I tried to get the United States to change its policy. The
                    policy was finally changed, I'm sure not for legal reasons, but for political
                    reasons. One often encounters areas when working as a lawyer in the State
                    Department where it becomes unclear whether what you are advocating is really
                    law or policy. The two overlap and are difficult to separate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a separate advisor for UN affairs. SALANS:There
                        was a separate advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been also involved on these issues in a UN
                        context.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SALANS:I was and more particularly when I became Deputy Legal Advisor because at
                    that point I had responsibility for supervising a number of offices in the Legal
                    Advisor's office. The United Nations Affairs office was one of those offices, as
                    well as many of the geographic offices. Those were the principal areas of my
                    responsibility. Again, I am not sure about the timing of this, but I know that
                    another Far Eastern area in which I was involved and on which I spent a lot of
                    time was the United States' relations with Australia, and particularly the
                    setting up in Australia of U.S. military facilities and also the negotiation of
                    agreements for the status of United States forces in Australia. I traveled to
                    Australia when William Battle was the United States Ambassador to Australia. We
                    became very close friends because we worked together day and night flying back
                    and forth from Sydney where as I recall, the Australian Minister of Foreign
                    affairs had his offices, and Canberra where the Embassy was located, where we
                    worked. For two or three weeks we negotiated base agreements and status of
                    forces agreements. Mr. Battle, later, either he became Governor of the State of
                    Virginia or it was his father who was Governor of the State of Virginia. The
                    Battles were a family which was very politically involved in the State of
                    Virginia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SALANS:That may be; he was that sort of person. I think that is right. In any
                    case, I also remember that after he was Ambassador, the Nixon administration's
                    Deputy Attorney General Mr. Patrick Gray investigated him. I think he was the
                    Deputy Attorney General. He went after him for his disloyalty to the United
                    States while he was Ambassador in Australia. Mr. Battle asked me to be a witness
                    in court for him. The charges were eventually dismissed by the judge. Gray was
                    later prosecuted himself for having broken the law in some way. It was one of
                    these political vendettas that were not too far distant from what later took
                    place in the Watergate affair.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SALANS:That's right, but there it was. In any case, that was another experience
                    that was interesting and that I recall from my days as Assistant Legal Advisor
                    for Far Eastern Affairs, or as I say it may have been somewhat later when I was
                    Deputy Legal Advisor, but I believe those occasions took place in 1963-4 which
                    would have made them during my tenure as Assistant Legal Advisor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that just from a feeling of broadening out and getting
                        in new region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:I think so. I think whoever the powers were in the Legal Advisors Office
                    at that time thought that it would be useful for me to broaden out and have
                    another experience. Maybe they already had in mind that they needed to finger
                    someone who would be Deputy Legal Advisor and they wanted me to have a different
                    experience. I'm not sure, but I do recall that one day I got called in to what
                    we call the front office by either Abram Chayes, who was Legal Advisor at that
                    time, or Leonard Meeker, who was his successor. They asked me if I would be
                    willing to take on the job of Inter-American Affairs, which I was happy to do.
                    That job lasted not much longer than two years for me. What I remember as the
                    principal areas of activity during that period are, one, there were negotiations
                    or re-negotiations of parts of the series of treaties that make up the
                    Inter-American system. The Rio Treaty I believe it was called which created the
                    Organization of American States and also created defense ties between the United
                    States and the other nations of the hemisphere. It also contained clauses about
                    the principle of non-interference in one another's affairs, which the Latin
                    Americans always felt was important vis a vis, the United States. There were
                    negotiations in Rio and in Buenos Aires during that period 1964-'65-'66. In that
                    period, I traveled to those cities with the Legal Advisor who was Leonard
                    Meeker. We assisted in the negotiation and drafting on behalf of the United
                    States of those revised treaties.</p>
                <p>Q: When you switch from one area to another as legal advisor that must be a
                    tremendous reading in. You are advising on all the precedent treaties and
                    expected to know.</p>
                <p>SALANS:There is a tremendous reading in. There is also a certain amount of
                    continuity in those offices. People who have been in those offices for some time
                    continue to work there and you learn from the people who have been working in
                    those areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are civil servants, research types?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SALANS:They are lawyers like myself. For example, when I first started, I didn't
                    know very much about the United States' relations with Far Eastern countries,
                    but after two or three years, I knew quite a bit. If a new Assistant Legal
                    Advisor had come into that office, he would certainly have relied on me to a
                    great extent to fill in the background that he didn't have. I remember very
                    definitely when I became Deputy Legal Advisor, the Legal Advisors, who were all
                    political appointees who came from outside the Department and who had been in
                    private practice somewhere, never had any public international law background or
                    experience, relied heavily on me and other people like me who had been there for
                    many years. That is not unusual in the State Department or the Legal Advisors
                    office. It happens in any organization. So, you are right. When one switches
                    from one area to another, there is a lot of reading to do to familiarize oneself
                    with the treaties, agreements, the history of relations between one country and
                    another, the problems that have been historic problems, whether there are border
                    problems or territorial disputes or sensitive issues of relations between one
                    country and another. These are things that one had to try to familiarize oneself
                    with in the political and legal background.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there the same kind of interest in the Department in the Latin American
                    area? It sounds as though the Far East was slightly higher profile.</p>
                <p>SALANS:I didn't think so at the time I was doing this. I didn't have a feeling
                    that I was moving from an area of higher profile to an area of lower profile. My
                    days as Assistant Legal Advisor for Far Eastern Affairs were before the Vietnam
                    War started, and while relations with Southeast Asia and China and Japan were
                    obviously important, there has always been a great deal of importance and
                    emphasis on United States' relationships within its own continents, North and
                    South America. I was involved, for example, in the beginnings of the
                    negotiations on the Panama Canal Treaty with Ambassador John Irwin who later
                    became United States Ambassador to France. I saw him here as well. In those days
                    we were working on the beginnings of the treaty to return the Panama Canal to
                    the Panamanians. We were working already on the problems with the border between
                    the United States and Mexico and all the difficulties that were created along
                    that border with illegal immigration. The use of the waters of Colorado River as
                    between the U.S. and Mexico was an issue in which the Legal Advisor's Office
                    played a key role. There was an unusual issue that arose, I remember, which had
                    to do with the status of the territory in Central America called Belize. There
                    was a dispute between Great Britain and Honduras over the status of Belize. The
                    United States was asked to name a mediator to mediate the dispute between those
                    two countries. The mediator was a man by the name of Bethuel Webster, who was a
                    senior lawyer in a New York law firm. He came down to Washington to fulfill this
                    job at the time when I was Assistant Legal Advisor for Latin American Affairs. I
                    was his chief interlocutor. You talk about trying to educate people; there was
                    an enormous education process so he could understand. I was not that familiar
                    with the dispute either before the mediation, so we both were really learning
                    together. I was in a sense his backstop in the State Department for those
                    negotiations which finally led to an agreement between the U.K. and Honduras
                    over what was going to happen to this territory they disputed.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very traditional New York, old-line type. It
                        seems odthat he would become involved in that kind of a dispute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:It was odd. I thought he was an odd choice myself, but he turned out to be
                    a very wise man and very apt at listening to what each side had to say and
                    weighing the pros and cons of what they had to say and going back to them with
                    more questions. It made them think about whether their position was all that
                    sound as they thought it was from the beginning, and gently working them over
                    time to a common position. He turned out to be a very good choice, even though
                    as you say, he was a very traditional, conservative, wall Street lawyer who was
                    not especially suited for this sort of thing from his private practice. That is
                    one of the strengths of government in the United States that you don't find so
                    much in other countries. For example, here in France, the Foreign Service is
                    essentially a career service, with very little movement between the private
                    sector and the Service. In the United States people from private life come into
                    the government with a fresh eye and different experience. They are not career
                    foreign service officers, but they bring something that often is very valuable
                    to the conduct of United States foreign polica fresh look, a new imagination,
                    different ideas. They don't always bring something positive, but they can.
                    People like Governor Harriman, Mr. Webster and others, Jack Irwin for example,
                    were examples of that principle. It works very well in the United States,
                    although Foreign Service officers often complain about someone coming in from
                    outside to usurp their functions. They do; but on balance it is a good
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find advising these different delegations differences in strategy and
                    differences in style say between Asians you had worked with and then moving into
                    the Latin context?</p>
                <p>SALANS:Well certainly the countries we dealt with and the representatives of
                    those countries were quite different. Asians generally came from different
                    cultures altogether. Even among Asians there are differences say with the
                    approach of the Japanese to the approach of the Chinese, or the Chinese as
                    opposed to the Indians, the Indonesians as opposed to of course the Australians.
                    Then Latin America I found to be something totally different for which I didn't
                    think I was especially well suited, mainly because I didn't speak the language.
                    I didn't speak Asian languages either, but I didn't feel such a disadvantage
                    there because everybody I dealt with even then spoke English. The Latin
                    Americans had a common language among themselves. Everything was done in
                    Spanish, except when they were talking to the North Americans, whereas the
                    Asians, each Asian country had its own language and they couldn't speak to one
                    another in any common language, so English was the common language. That made a
                    big difference in my ability to deal effectively with these people.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SALANS:No. If the job had lasted longer, I would have done that, but no longer
                    had I been appointed Assistant Legal Advisor for Latin American Affairs or
                    Inter-American Affairs I think it was called. It must have been a year and a
                    half after, I was called in by Leonard Meeker to his office. He was the Legal
                    Advisor, and he said, “Carl, I think the time has come for you to become a
                    Deputy Legal Advisor.” That is all he said. So, I didn't get deeply into my job
                    and didn't have time to learn the language.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned some of the border and immigration issues which you found in
                    that context that you were working with local American authorities and lawyers.
                    How was that intersection?</p>
                <p>SALANS:We found we were working not with local American lawyers but with other
                    departments of the government, the Justice Department, Defense Department,
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service, Treasury Department in certain cases
                    involving some of these areas. It was often an inter-agency effort to deal with
                    the problems and one had to coordinate among the different departments of the
                    government. It was not so much with outside lawyers and private practitioners.
                    If they had problems on behalf of clients, say, they would not come to the State
                    Department with those problems, or at least not to me in my experience. They
                    went to other agencies of the government.</p>

                <p>SALANS:No, I don't think I ever dealt with a drug problem at thapoint. It was

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SALANS:I am the Deputy Legal Advisor, and I had responsibility essentially for
                    the geographic bureaus of the Department, as opposed to what I think of as the
                    functional bureaus of the Department. Therefore, I did not work on economic
                    affairs very much for example. I did work on matters involving all of the
                    geographic areas of the world as well as on United Nations matters, and very
                    often also on political-military affairs. These were the years when Vietnam was
                    beginning to be a real issue not so much with the public, but within the
                    government. They were the years during which George Ball was attempting to
                    influence Vietnam policy in one direction. I am speaking within the State
                    Department. There were many characters involved in this. They were the years in
                    which the Deputy Undersecretary of State was a man by the name of U. Alexis
                    Johnson, who had a view on Vietnam which was different from the view of Mr.
                    Ball. Dean Rusk was Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the common polarity there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:What was the polarity? The polarity was Johnson felt, as I think did Dean
                    Rusk, that the United States had to stop communists from taking over South
                    Vietnam. He viewed the struggle there as essentially one between China, Russia,
                    and the communist world on the one hand and the Free World on another. Whereas,
                    George Ball's view, I think, was more that this was a civil war. There wasn't an
                    awful lot the United States could do. Nor was it a conflict that engaged the
                    vital interests of the United States. We had to rely on the local Vietnamese and
                    support them to the extent we could, but we should not involve United States
                    forces and United States prestige in trying to beat off what was essentially not
                    a threat to United States security but a local civil war situation. Leonard
                    Meeker who was the Legal Advisor at that time, had very strong views that the
                    United States should not be military directly involved in the Vietnam situation.
                    I shared those views, frankly, and we worked together to produce and write many
                    memoranda to the Secretary of State and other people in the Department trying to
                    argue from a legal standpoint, the framework of the Geneva accords, why the
                    United States policy should be more one of trying to duplicate for Vietnam what
                    had been done in the Geneva agreements for Laos back in 1962 rather than huge
                    troop involvements, military involvements which were not justified as a matter
                    of international law and under the Geneva agreements. This again was lawyers
                    arguing policy issues, what we felt from a policy standpoint the United States
                    should do. We were the lawyers in the department so we had to use whatever legal
                    reasoning or rationale we could. I remember U. Alexis Johnson not being very
                    appreciative of legal advice which he felt was more policy and not really legal
                    advice; and he was right. Of course, we made the arguments, we lost the
                    arguments. Nobody really paid much attention to what the lawyers were saying.
                    But I often had interplay with people like Bill Bundy, U. Alexis Johnson, even
                    Mr. Rusk, who by that time I had come to know quite well, and we worked a lot on
                    that whole Southeast Asia area particularly on Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes. Essentially what my experience in terms of Southeast Asia was from
                    1966 to 1968, I was in Washington in the Department and increasingly spending
                    time on the Vietnam situation. For example, I remember very well having drafted
                    what later became the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, but wasn't the Tonkin Gulf
                    Resolution at the time I drafted it, and putting it away in my drawer as a kind
                    of contingency plan that if something happened of the kind that later happened
                    in the Tonkin Gulf, the United States had an approach to the Congress to seek
                    authority for carrying on military operations. When the Tonkin Gulf incident
                    occurred and United States ships were attacked, we pulled that document out of
                    our files and put it into the context of what actually happened at the time and
                    it then became the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, but it was something that had been
                    thought of before as a contingency. So, there was this period of two years when
                    I was working on various aspects of the increasing military role of the United
                    Statethe constitutional powers of the President to commit U.S. forces to
                    Vietnam, the applicability of the SEATO treaty, the framework of the 1954 Geneva
                    Agreement, the international law justification for the U.S. intervention in
                    Vietnam, etc. I think that perhaps during this period, maybe you can help me on
                    this, the so-called “Pentagon Papers” were released, to the Washington Post or
                    the New York Times?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ellsberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:I remember that it was either between this period 1966-'68 or it was
                    perhaps at a subsequent time when I was in Washington as Deputy Legal Advisor,
                    that Daniel Ellsberg had released the Pentagon Papers, and we, the Legal
                    Advisors Office and me in particular were involved with the Justice Department
                    and particularly with Mr. William Rehnquist who at that time was Assistant
                    Attorney General for Civil Affairs, who worked out the Executive Branch's
                    position vis a vis the press and vis a vis the courts. It eventually got to the
                    Supreme Court, and we worked out the Executive Branch's position. There was an
                    enormous struggle between the State Department and the Justice Department
                    because the State Department or at least I, the Legal Advisors Office, felt
                    there was really no constitutional basis to prevent the publication of these
                    papers. But, the Justice Department and the White House felt very strongly that
                    everything had to be done to prevent their publication. The suit went ahead with
                    the result that the papers were finally published. Then in the fall of 1968,
                    Governor Harriman asked that I come to Paris to help in the delegation there and
                    the negotiations with the Vietnamese to try and resolve the Vietnam situation.
                    So, in November, I think it was, of 1968, I moved to Paris and was here.</p>

                        monthof the Democratic administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SALANS:The elections must have taken place. It was the last months of the
                    Democratic administration, but there was still an effort being made on the part
                    of Governor Harriman and Cyrus Vance to try to conclude an agreement with the
                    Vietnamese before Mr. Johnson left office. That's my recollection. I remember
                    working with the two of them to try to persuade everybody and then even into the
                    first days of the Nixon administration, that an agreement could be reached with
                    the Vietnamese which would have been an agreement that would have in effect
                    declared Vietnam to be a neutral country and keep the government that then
                    existed in place with the addition of representatives of the North Vietnamese.
                    In other words, I think the term was a coalition government, everybody
                    recognizing that the likely outcome of this coalition government would be the
                    North Vietnamese communist dominance of the government. But, the feeling was
                    that was the best the United States could obtain anyway even if it continued to
                    fight; therefore, why not do what was at least on the face of it an honorable
                    settlement of the war which would give the non-communist parties in South
                    Vietnam an opportunity to prevail if they did the right things, but which would
                    have the risk in it that the North Vietnamese would dominate and eventually take
                    over the whole country. That was felt by Harriman, Vance, and others who shared
                    that view including me, that would avoid continuing the war and reach an outcome
                    that was likely to be the result of the war anyway. Those were in the first days
                    I was at the negotiations in Paris that was our principal preoccupation. This
                    was not so much a legal job, but I think I was perhaps helpful in putting this
                    sort of suggested solution in the context of historical continuity of policy
                    toward Southeast Asia going back to the 1954 agreements and then the 1962
                    agreements, which made it a sensible and honorable solution and a solution which
                    had been tried before in this part of the world.</p>
                <p>Q: There was intense scrutiny of those negotiations by the press. Were they going
                    on two levels, the open, public meetings and then there were the quiet meetings
                    in safe houses that both the Vietnamese and we had direct contact?</p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, that is exactly what was happening; although, the truth is as far as
                    I was concerned, I did not know for a long time that those secret meetings were
                    going on. I don't know whether that was common in the delegation for the more
                    junior people. I'm sure that Harriman and Cyrus Vance and probably Philip Habib
                    knew what was going on. I'm not sure whether the Carl Salans and the Dick
                    Holbrookes knew what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: In Phil Habib's own oral history, he describes intricate logistics of picking
                    up Vance and Harriman and these safe houses out in the suburbs, how they would
                    get figures as visible as Harriman and Vance without the press getting on to
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, of course, I have read about all of that since, but I'm telling you
                    that at the time and for a long time, I did not know that was going on even
                    though day in and day out, I was in the Embassy delegation working with all
                    these people. I simply didn't know. My activity was limited to what the public
                    saw which were weekly meetings between the two delegations at I think it was
                    called the Hotel Majestic on the Avenue Kleber, where statements would be made
                    by each of the delegations. I drafted many of those statements on the part of
                    the United States because again as I have said earlier, Governor Harriman relied
                    on me to a great extent for drafting his statements. But those statements really
                    got nowhere. They were just the public face. The real negotiation was going on
                    between Mr. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Kissinger then, that was in the next phase when the
                        Nixoadministration came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, that's right. Because, by the time I got to Paris which was November,
                    I think at that point while Harriman was still trying to reach an agreement, I
                    think he saw the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese were not going to
                    agree on anything until the new administration came in and they could see what
                    the policy of the new administration would be.</p>
                <p>Q: Phil Habib alleged in his oral history that the new administration actually
                    passed a message “Hang tough; you'll get a better deal from us.” to the
                    Vietnamese via that well-known Taiwanese.</p>
                <p>SALANS:He passed this message to the South Vietnamese, not to the North
                    Vietnamese. They passed this message to General Thieu who was then the president
                    of South Vietnam. Again, I have read this since. I didn't know at the time that
                    such a message had been passed, but reading the memoirs of people like Henry
                    Kissinger and William Bundy, one sees that in fact that did happen and accounts
                    for the fact that the South Vietnamese dragged their feet until the new
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a stiffening of their position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:We definitely noticed a stiffening in their position as we sat there. As I
                    said earlier, both Governor Harriman and Mr. Vance became less and less
                    optimistic as the end of the Johnson administration came that they would be able
                    to do anything because they could see that the South Vietnamese government was
                    not prepared to go along, was dragging its feet, and they suspected if they
                    didn't know that the new administration had told them not to make an
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think you as the legal advisor must have been frustrated. The
                    delegation was meeting secretly and there are the open talks and the new
                    incoming administration saying hold off, don't make a deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, I was very frustrated, and my frustration eventually led to my
                    leaving the State Department and the decision to stay in Paris and go into
                    private practice. It was extremely frustrating because I felt very strongly that
                    in 1968 and early 1969 an agreement could have been reached which would have
                    preserved the ability of the South Vietnamese, our South Vietnamese as opposed
                    to the Viet Cong, it preserved their ability to survive if they could
                    politically function properly without the war continuing. You could have
                    negotiated with North Vietnam a coalition government solution. They would have
                    been perfectly confident that with time, they could have prevailed, but you
                    would at least have preserved a chance for our South Vietnamese to prevail and
                    stopped the fighting at that point I think. When we saw what the new
                    administration wanted to do was in effect to continue the war to save the
                    “honor” of the United States as they saw it, I found that extremely frustrating
                    and I quickly decided to come back to Washington to finish my career in the
                    State Department and then to leave the Department altogether and to return to
                    Paris to practice law. Q: So you then stayed in Paris a little bit into 1969
                    with the new team.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SALANS:I did. I stayed all of 1969 here in Paris. I wanted to leave earlier. I
                    remember going to Governor Harriman while he was still here, it must have been
                    the end of 1968, and saying to him that I would like to leave because I was just
                    so unhappy. He said to me that I should stay. He said the government needs
                    people like you to stay and continue to fight for what you think is the right
                    position. You should stay. “I'm leaving,” he said, “but you should stay.” That
                    sort of puffed up my chest and head a little bit and I stayed on for another
                    year, but nothing changed and indeed I thought it even got worse in the sense
                    that we began to extend the war into Cambodia, into Laos. The whole policy of
                    saving the honor of the United States by intensifying the war under the guise of
                    a withdrawal of American forces, but relying more on bombers and impersonal
                    methods of warfare, I found an obnoxious policy, so I asked to be sent back to
                    Washington. Jack Stevenson from Sullivan and Cromwell was then the Legal Advisor
                    in the State Department. He wanted me back to help him run the office. So, I
                    spent a year more, 1970-71. During this period, I was occasionally detached from
                    the Vietnam delegation to perform specific functions on behalf of the U.S.
                    Government elsewhere. I remember going to The Hague as the legal advisor on the
                    U.S. delegation to negotiate the first International Aircraft Hijacking
                    Convention. I remember the French delegation at that conference, heading by Mr.
                    Guillaume, who is now a judge on the International Court of Justice, playing a
                    very obstructive role, not wanting to surrender sovereignty by agreeing to
                    extradite hijackers to another country. I remember being sent to Tripoli to
                    assist Ambassador Palmer in negotiating the withdrawal of American forces from
                    Wheeling Air Force Base in Libya after Qadhafi came to power. That was an
                    interesting experience, because the Libyan Government had organized mobs of
                    screaming Libyans outside the conference room, shouting “Go Home”, and every
                    time the negotiations reached a difficult point, a member of the Libyan
                    delegation would get up from the table, walk over to a window and open it so we
                    could better hear the howling mob. At the outset of the negotiations, Ambassador
                    Palmer had to ask the Libyan delegation (whose members were all dressed in
                    battle fatigues) to remove their submachine guns from the room, where they had
                    brought them into the room and laid them on the negotiating table, to impress
                    us. That was quite an experience.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get into that, there was quite a transition in the working
                    composition of the delegation. Is it your perception that the new administration
                    came in with considerable suspicion, replaced the Vietnamese speaking American
                    interpreters, that kind of a thing? People like Phil Habib would have been
                    phasing out in that period. Did you see that kind of reshuffle transition?</p>
                <p>SALANS:No. There was of course a reshuffling at the top. Harriman and Vance left.
                    I believe the first person that came in after that was Henry Cabot Lodge and
                    then David Bruce followed as the negotiator. Then eventually Philip Habib became
                    the negotiator. I think he was head of the delegation for awhile wasn't he?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Q: He describes in his oral history with a lot of indignation somebody he brought
                    in to interpret who knew Vietnam that initially the incoming team didn't want to
                    use. I think he said they turned it over to General Vernon Walters. He set up
                    the safe house negotiations through French intelligence sources.</p>
                <p>SALANS:I do remember that General Walters suddenly began to appear as a principal
                    player in the negotiations. That I do recall with the advent of the new
                    administration. At the lower level, I remember Philip Habib staying on. I
                    remember Bob Miller staying on. I remember Dick Holbrooke staying oI can't
                    recall the other...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Negroponte.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:John Negroponte stayed on. I stayed on during that period. At the level of
                    interpreters, I don't remember that frankly. I don't see what the importance of
                    that would have been at that level, but I certainly do remember Vernon Walters
                    suddenly appearing and becoming more of a presence. He had an office not with
                    the delegation but elsewhere in the Embassy. One would see more of him starting
                    with the new administration.</p>
                <p>Q: That was quite a crew, Dick Holbrooke and John Negroponte and some of the
                    people who rose to the surface. You observed them in fairly intense activity in
                    this period?</p>
                <p>SALANS:I did. They were young at that time, as was I. We were all in our 30's
                    although Holbrooke, I think, may have been in his 20's. I'm not sure. We were
                    all young people. Holbrooke and Negroponte were extremely bright people. Dick
                    Holbrooke even at that time was an aggressive young hawk type person, but much
                    admired by everybody he worked with, an obvious star, as he later became. John
                    Negroponte was a quieter person but also very bright, very imaginative. They
                    were both devoted hard working people and as I recall it, very frustrated people
                    in the delegation, as I was. I certainly had the highest admiration for them as
                    I did for Bob Miller who was a more senior foreign service officer at that time.
                    I remember a funny incident with Bob Miller. He was, from a hierarchical
                    standpoint, below me in the hierarchy of the State Department. I was Deputy
                    Legal Advisor which was the equivalent of a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,
                    and I think he maybe was at the level of a desk officer, but Phil Habib asked me
                    if despite that I would be willing to sit lower down in the delegation of the
                    ranks when the delegation marched into the room where the famous four sided
                    table was, would I be willing to sit and have Bob Miller sit in a higher order.
                    Of course I said yes. It had no importance to me whatsoever. He was a wonderful
                    guy and also I think deeply frustrated as I saw it. Peter Tarnoff and Jim
                    Rosenthal were also involved in the Vietnam Peace Talk and they later rose to
                    the heights in the Department.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He put me on to interviewing you. I think it is an
                        interested perspective. So you came back to Washington with this frustration
                        and had a final year or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:I had a final year or so in Washington as Deputy Legal Advisor. I
                    continued to work on Vietnam negotiations from Washington, although I was
                    replaced on the delegation by another lawyer whose name was George Aldrich. He
                    came from the Legal Advisors Office. He really handled most of the legal issues
                    in the negotiations rather than me in Washington. I stayed involved and stayed
                    abreast of what was happening. At that point I was really representing the Legal
                    Advisors Office at many of the meetings at senior levels in the Department. I
                    went to the weekly staff meetings of the Secretary of State where there were
                    discussions of what was happening in Vietnam. I attended a lot of meetings with
                    U. Alexis Johnson that were concerned with Southeast Asia and the war because
                    the Legal Advisor himself was principally tied up in the law of the sea
                    negotiations. There were negotiations going on about law of the sea treaties. He
                    was extremely interested in that, and he left to me basically the role of
                    administering and managing the office and representing the office in these other
                    meetings. I also became involved in other matters apart from Vietnam. I came
                    back to Paris I remember in the last year, it must have been 1971, as the
                    principal United States representative in the negotiations of what became known
                    as the World Heritage Convention. This was a UNESCO negotiation which led to an
                    international treaty by which a number of historic or geographic sites of renown
                    were named as part of the world cultural heritage. That was a refreshing change
                    for me from the Vietnam negotiations. It was more constructive, and led to
                    something that even today the world enjoys and appreciates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you had a fairly sizable office to manage you
                        know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes there were I think at that point 60-70 lawyers in the office. It was a
                    good experience for later coming to Paris and starting my own law firm and
                    learning how to manage lawyers, which doesn't come easily to lawyers. Management
                    is not usually a lawyer's strength.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you have a couple of lawyers up in New York, Herb
                        Reis anBob Rosenstock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SALANS:Herbert Reis, yes. I think Bob Rosenstock was in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reporting directly to L?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SALANS:They were reporting to the Ambassador and to the Assistant Secretary of
                    State for United Nations. The Legal Advisors Office, particularly the Assistant
                    Legal Advisor for United Nations Affairs, did have a role in supervising the
                    work of Bob Rosenstock and Herb Reis. I would occasionally have something to do
                    with their affairs as well, particularly Herb Reis whom I knew better. He came
                    from Washington. Bob Rosenstock had a different origin. I don't know where. The
                    Legal Advisors office also sent a lawyer to Saigon. I think Bob Starr was sent
                    to Saigon as a lawyer and worked there for a year or two. We sent a lawyer to
                    Geneva to work there in the U.S. mission to the various United Nations
                    organizations located there. It was the beginning of an expansion of the legal
                    realm outside of Washington a bit. We brought in for the first time what I would
                    say was a visiting scholar from the international law world, Professor Louis
                    Sohn from Harvard, and later Steven Schwebel, I think he came from private
                    practice. He is now the President of the International Court of Justice. John
                    Moore from the University of Virginia and Professor Baxter from Harvard Law
                    School, they all came down and spent a year in the Legal Advisors Office. That
                    was a program that was started during my years as Deputy Legal Advisor.</p>
                <p>Q: With Reis and Rosenstock, were there sometimes differences of opinion between
                    Washington and what they and the Ambassador there wanted to do?</p>
                <p>SALANS:I don't remember that as being a particularly contentious relationship.
                    There are always differences of view on what people want to do, but I don't
                    remember those as occupying my mind or my time very much. Whatever differences
                    there were I think were basically worked out. Herb Reis had been for many years
                    Assistant Legal Advisor for United Nations Affairs in the Legal Advisors Office.
                    Therefore he knew the Office well. I don't think there was anything that rose to
                    the level of what you would call friction between us.</p>
                <p>Q: Differences the L perspective and traditional FSO culture. I always felt most
                    FSOs regarded the lawyer coming as somebody that would make problems for them,
                    find reasons why they couldn't do whatever they wanted.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, I think that that attitude depended a lot on who the Secretary of
                    State was and who the people at the top of the Department were. First of all, I
                    think that in the general conduct of foreign affairs, the law does not play a
                    very important role. That's unfortunate from my standpoint, but that is the
                    fact. International law is not a very settled and organized group of rules that
                    countries or nations really abide by to a great extent, unfortunately. But, very
                    often countries and the United States in particular want to appear to be
                    complying with law. I think it is in the interest particularly of the United
                    States and countries like the United States to establish rules of law that other
                    nations will be guided by so they will act in a predictable way and not resort
                    to force to settle problems. One of the roles of the lawyer in the State
                    Department is to show the foreign service officer why it is important for the
                    actions of the United States in the field of foreign affairs to conform to some
                    standards which one could cite as precedents to other countries as the way
                    things should be done. You negotiate agreements, treaties, conventions, whatever
                    form they take, to standardize rules of behavior on one subject or another and
                    lay down the rules by which you are going to be judged. Very often foreign
                    service officers don't see the relevance of this and often what the lawyers say
                    are the rules that have grown up over history, custom, practice, treaty, they
                    find inconvenient because oftentimes it frustrates what they want to do. Again
                    the intelligent lawyer whether it is in foreign service or private practice
                    tries to find a way that the policy maker or the client can achieve what it
                    wants to achieve but in a way that conforms more with rules and standards of
                    behavior that conform to law. I always felt that most of the people I dealt with
                    in the foreign service appreciated what the lawyer was trying to do although
                    they often, I would say most often didn't in the end pay much attention to what
                    the lawyer was saying. Maybe they did to a certain extent. Maybe they modified
                    their policies a little bit to take into account the law. They certainly liked
                    to have the lawyers on their side so that they could, whether it was vis a vis
                    the public, vis a vis the Congress, vis a vis another nation, say that what they
                    were doing was in conformity with the law. Sometimes it wasn't a vague
                    international law standard people had to be concerned with but statutes that
                    were enacted by Congress that you had to comply with while conducting your
                    foreign policy. There, people looked to the Legal Advisors Office to tell them
                    whether they could or could not do something that may have been regulated by
                    statute. Often it was a question of whether constitutionally the executive
                    branch of the government or the President could do something without going to
                    Congress. There very often were issues the State Department and the Justice
                    Department had to work out over the ability of the President to act as Chief
                    Executive and the United States spokesman in foreign affairs without the consent
                    of Congress. So, the role of the lawyer in the State Department is
                    multi-faceted.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that the view of the lawyers at the FSO level would depend on
                    the Secretary. Would you say that among the different secretaries you have
                    observed, there was a different feeling toward them?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SALANS:I think so. I did not work in the State Department under many Secretaries
                    of State. I worked principally under Dean Rusk, but I think I know what the
                    attitude of Mr. Kissinger was toward law and lawyers even though I was not in
                    the Department when he became Secretary of State. I think that he did not
                    believe, and I think he has even said this publicly in his writings and his
                    speeches, that law was an important factor for him in what he decided to do.
                    Where I think Dean Rusk had a greater appreciation of the role that a lawyer
                    could play. Not only was the attitude of the Secretary of State important but
                    the relationship of the Secretary of State to his Legal Advisor. This is a very
                    personal thing. If the Secretary thought that his legal advisor was a wise man
                    who could help him, then I think, he paid more attention to the law, and his
                    under secretaries and assistant secretaries also got the message that the
                    Secretary was interested in what his legal advisor was saying. I think, for
                    example, that Dean Rusk's relationship with Abe Chayes, with Leonard Meeker
                    later, was quite close, and Chayes, of course, had his own relationships in the
                    White House, which Meeker didn't have. Those relationships, one could see in the
                    office that your role went up or down very often depending on who the Legal
                    Advisor was, who the Secretary was. I think also in the Department there were
                    people like George Ball, for example, who was somebody who liked to hear what
                    lawyers had to say. U. Alexis Johnson looked at lawyers as people who would help
                    him justify what he had already decided on without regard to what the law was.
                    This was true of other people who were in policy making positions.</p>
                <p>Q: Having an actual lawyer as Secretary like Secretary Christopher or Secretary
                    Vance, that too would change the relationship although you weren't there at
                    those times.</p>
                <p>SALANS:I think that certainly that would. If one is trained in the law, one has a
                    greater appreciation for the legal aspects of foreign policy. I think even the
                    President's attitude toward the law could also be a factor, whether he felt that
                    legal aspects of policy making were important or not. Abram Chayes' role, as
                    State Department Advisor, in the Cuban Missile Crisis helped shape United States
                    policy there because President Kennedy and his closest advisors wanted him to
                    play a role.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the contact with the White house that some of the advisors had.
                    Did you find that as the Deputy, you were frequently in contact with lawyers in
                    the White House or the Congress or the CIA as these policies developed?</p>
                <p>SALANS:Yes, I was. I don't have a strong recollection of those relationships.
                    They were not daily kinds of relationships. Certainly I had relationships with
                    lawyers in the Justice Department, the CIA, and the White House. I remember
                    working with people like John Dean in the White House during the Nixon
                    Administration, who later became infamous, but I don't have any strong
                    impressions of those relationships. They were sporadic relationships devoted to
                    specific issues that came up that were not of a continuing nature in my personal
                    experience. It may be different for other people.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Q: Well, in this last year were there any other things you would like to mention.
                    You were watching just what you had opposed on Vietnam come to pass, the
                    expansion of the war, the strikes over the parrots beak, that was in that
                    period.</p>
                <p>SALANS:That was in that period. The last year of my tenure at the State
                    Department was really a year in which I was actively looking to do something
                    else. I mentioned earlier the negotiation in Paris for the World Heritage
                    Convention. I probably came to Paris three or four times during 1971 for that
                    negotiation, and whenever I had any free time, I would go out and see if I
                    couldn't find a job in Paris which I finally did. At that point I was 39 years
                    old. I had never been in private practice before. All my training and experience
                    was in public international law, and there aren't very many law firms looking
                    for people that age with no experience in commercial law and no clients or
                    willing to take them. In the end I had to accept a salary cut from my
                    magnificent government salary of $36,000 a year. I accepted a job for $30,000 in
                    Paris just so I could leave the government. I was really so frustrated over the
                    Vietnam policy. So I spent a lot of time in the last year just managing the
                    Legal Advisors Office. I'm sure I was involved with many things, which have
                    escaped my memory now, but I continued to work principally on the geographic
                    areas of the Department's activity. I continued to be involved in Asian matters.
                    I continued to be involved in Latin American matters, particularly the Panama
                    Canal. I was involved during that period it seems to me also, there must have
                    been something going on with respect to the Middle East, because I remember
                    trying to come up with ideas of what could be a possible status for Jerusalem in
                    the ultimate Arab-Israeli peace agreement. Even then we were thinking about that
                    and working on such issues. That last year, while I was trying to do my job, my
                    mind was really focused on leaving.</p>
                <p>Q: Well thinking about your experience there with respect to people who may read
                    your oral history and be thinking about an international law career, what
                    conclusions do you draw? Is the legal office something that is really a career
                    or is it to do what you did, a department to come in to or go out from?</p>
                <p>SALANS:Well, when I joined the Legal Advisors Office in 1959, it was definitely a
                    career legal office. People came and stayed for 30-40 years. That changed
                    radically with the advent of the Kennedy administration and with the appointment
                    of Abram Chayes from the Harvard Law School as the Legal Advisor. Abe Chayes
                    brought with him a bunch of young Harvard graduates who clearly had no public
                    law experience at all. In fact they had very little experience of any kind. They
                    were recently out of law school, most of these guys...</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>They were not people who were coming to the Legal Advisors Office for a career;
                    they were coming for an exciting experience where they would be in the field of
                    foreign relations with somebody they admired, Abram Chayes. Most of those people
                    stayed anywhere from three to six years and then left and went to teach in law
                    schools or to private practice or did something else with their lives. During
                    the tenure of Abe Chayes in the Office, the character of the Office began to
                    change. He continued to hire people who were not looking to the government for a
                    career, but who were energetic, bright, imaginative young lawyers interested in
                    an experience in the field of foreign relations. I very much encouraged this
                    attitude and carried on with it after Abe Chayes left following the
                    assassination of President Kennedy. I think this is a policy one has to be
                    careful about because as people come and go, so often you lose experience and
                    any continuity in what you are doing in the Office. There must be a balance I
                    think in the Legal Advisor's Office. Many people, like me for example, who come
                    thinking they will only stay for a few years, end up liking it and I stayed for
                    almost 15 years. Other people stayed longer than I did. Some people stayed for
                    far less time than I did. The Legal Advisors Office became one of the premier
                    government legal offices in Washington. It was able to attract the best lawyers
                    around, so that it became almost impossible to get in to the Legal Advisors
                    Office by the time I left the Office. As opposed to the days when I joined the
                    office, there was a steady stream of people who came and did not look upon their
                    job there as a career. There became such a demand for jobs in the Legal Advisors
                    Office that the office could attract the best people, people who were law clerks
                    to Supreme Court Justices which it never could get before. I continue to visit
                    the Legal Advisors Office to meet the new Legal Advisors as time goes on, and I
                    think the office remains a very exciting place. It is a place where lawyers can
                    become involved in the events of the day, the events in the newspaper, without
                    themselves being in the newspaper. They participate in and help to shape United
                    States foreign policy, even though the lawyer most often does not have the
                    leading role in the shaping of foreign policy. It is a job that demands a lot of
                    imagination. It is a job that requires one to have good relations with one's
                    clients, with the foreign service officers with whom one works. If one is going
                    to have any impact on foreign policy from a lawyer's standpoint, one has to
                    establish good working relationships and relationships of trust and confidence
                    in the advice you are giving so that you are listened to.</p>

                <p>The role of the lawyer in the formulation and execution of United States foreign
                    policy, while usually not determinative, can be influential and contribute to
                    sound policy. The lawyer advises his “clients”, the Secretary of State and those
                    under him, on what law and precedents exist with respect to a given situation
                    (both international law and domestic law) and how that law is to be interpreted.
                    The lawyer advises on the legal consequences of alternative policies or actions
                    being considered by the United States Government in its relations with other
                    countries and may recommend one or another as being sounder policy from a legal
                    standpoint. The lawyer advises as to what rules are desirable to foster in
                    international relations to achieve U.S. national interestsuch as peace, limits
                    on resort to force, democracy, stability, predictability, free trade, respect
                    for human rights, etc. when considering what policies the United States should
                    adopt or encourage others to adopt, bearing in mind that United States actions
                    create precedents which others will follow. Lawyers help to shape the way
                    policies fixed by the President or the Secretary of State are carried out to
                    conform to existing law or to create desirable precedents. Lawyers in the State
                    Department, together with those in the Justice Department, advise on what the
                    powers of the Executive Branch are in the field of foreign relations and on
                    compliance with U.S. legislation bearing on foreign affairs. They participate in
                    the creation of new rules of international law through the drafting of
                    international agreements and treaties. They are involved in dispute resolution,
                    whether before the International Court of Justice or in other fora. They testify
                    before congressional committees on issues within their domain. In all these ways
                    and many others the role of the lawyer in the State Department can be exciting
                    and stimulating, both as a lifetime career or as an experience in one's
                    professional life. Whenever I meet a young lawyer who is looking for a job, I
                    tell them about the Legal Advisors Office and tell them how much I enjoyed
                    working there and urge them to think of that as an alternative. I think it is an
                    exciting job and would like to continue to think it is one of the premier legal
                    offices in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, from the perspective of having spent an equal or longer time in a
                    private practice subsequently, the world has changed in that period, the
                    proliferation of NGOs, the other ways outside government that lawyers can shape
                    policy, it seems to me that you probably continued active in the same interests
                    you had before but just in different ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SALANS:I have remained interested, but I must say that I haven't participated in
                    the shaping of the policies toward the things I have been interested in. I've
                    frankly been so busy with the firm that I helped to establish in 1978 in Paris.
                    There were three of us, two Americans and one French lawyer, who established a
                    firm which in 20 years has grown to over 300 lawyers with offices in eight
                    different cities around the world. That has been a full time job and a full time
                    occupation, so that I have not had much time to participate in the other events
                    that are of most interest to me. Frankly, private law practice is not nearly as
                    exciting to me as practicing law in the State Department was. I much more
                    enjoyed what I was doing in the Legal Advisors Office than I have in private
                    practice. What I have enjoyed in private practice is building an institution.
                    That I liked, and I even liked that when I was in the Legal Advisors Office. The
                    idea of attracting bright young people and surrounding oneself with the people
                    in whom you had confidence who did excellent work has always been something that
                    gave me a great deal of satisfaction. I have continued to do that in private
                    practice. Now, just recently I have really retired from my position as a partner
                    in this firm. I continue to come into the office from time to time, but I am now
                    trying to enjoy my children and my grandchildren, my wife and...</p>
                <p>Q: Well, Mr. Salans, we thank you very much. This concludes the oral history
                    interview December 30, with Carl Salans conducted by Richard Jackson.</p>
