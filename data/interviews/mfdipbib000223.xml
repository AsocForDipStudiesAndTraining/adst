                <p>Interviewed by: Melbourne Spector </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 8, 1996</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an oral history project under the Marshall Plan
                        portion of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program which in turn is a part
                        of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. The subject today is
                        William Colman, a distinguished public administrator who has worked in both
                        international, national, state and local fields. We are going to concentrate
                        today mainly on his experience with the Foreign Aid program. My name is Mel
                        Spector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bill, why don't you go ahead and tell us a little bit about your background and
                    how you got into the foreign aid business.</p>
                <p>COLMAN: In brief, my university training was in the field of public
                    administration at the University of Missouri and the University of Chicago. I
                    finished my academic work in 1939-1940. My first working experience was in the
                    State government of Missouri to carry out the requirement under the Social
                    Security Act that employees of State and unemployment compensation agencies be
                    selected under a merit system. In a lot of states this called for setting up a
                    new personnel system because the civil service competitive examination process
                    had not been universally adopted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what year was this, Bill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: In the spring of 1938 I took leave from my M.A. graduate work at Missouri
                    and went to St. Louis to assist the person who had been selected to handle the
                    Missouri state government program to establish a merit system in unemployment
                    compensation. That person was Professor William Burke at Washington University.
                    I finished some work under his supervision and returned to the University of
                    Missouri in late 1938 to finish my Master's Degree work, and I received the M.A.
                    in June, 1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The degree was in what field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>COLMAN: Political Science. Then I went on to the University of Chicago to begin
                    work toward a Ph.D. I studied under Charles Merriam and Leonard D. White.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two of the greats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I was there two quarters, and it was then decided in Missouri that they
                    would move the merit system office from St. Louis to Jefferson City, the State
                    capital. Congress, in the meantime had broadened the amendment to the Social
                    Security Act by extending the merit system requirement to state public welfare
                    and public health. So it was necessary to install a merit system in the health
                    and welfare departments of the state government as well as perfecting the one in
                    unemployment compensation. I was contacted because of my earlier experience in
                    St. Louis to come out and set up the larger system.</p>
                <p>I went to Jefferson City in April of 1940. A Merit System Council appointed by
                    the governor was in overall charge and I was the Merit System Supervisor. I went
                    through the whole process of setting up rules and regulations, getting positions
                    classified, examinations held, and registers of eligibles established. I
                    completed that for the agencies and they began to appoint their new employees
                    off of the merit system registers. By that time it was late 1941 and I was then
                    asked by the Director of State Personnel in Louisiana (perhaps with the
                    encouragement of Albert Aaronson of the Social Security Board) to go down and do
                    the same thing in Louisiana that I had done in Missouri. I arrived in Baton
                    Rouge in early October and set up shop and laid out the installation
                    schedules.</p>
                <p>Pearl Harbor occurred in December. Rather coincidentally, I received a telegram
                    from Charles Mills in Washington who was in the Office of Emergency Management
                    asking if I would be available to take a position in the Classification Section
                    of the Personnel Office of the War Production Board (WPB). My natural instincts,
                    perhaps like those of numerous people at that time, told me that I might have a
                    better chance of not getting called to military duty if I were working for the
                    Federal Government and particularly in the War Production Board. It was like a
                    magnet; it drew me to Washington. There, for a brief period of about two months,
                    I was a Classification Analyst under the immediate supervision of Arthur
                    Tackman. However, the Personnel Director of the War Production Board then
                    declared that he would no longer ask for deferments of employees from military
                    service and I applied to the Navy for a commission and was commissioned an
                    Ensign in May of 1942. I put in four years in the military, all in personnel
                    management work.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My first duty was in the Office of Naval Officer Procurement (ONOP), First Naval
                    District headquarters in Boston. That involved interviewing civilians applying
                    for commissions in the Navy. Then I was transferred to the Naval Training
                    Station at Bainbridge, Maryland where I later became the Selection Officer in
                    the Station's personnel office. My staff and I were in charge of selecting or
                    assigning graduating recruits to various kinds of duties, filling orders coming
                    into the Training Station for personnel with various qualifications. By that
                    time IBM was a well-known firm, and we were putting the qualifications of these
                    people on punch cards and then when they needed people with certain backgrounds
                    we would make the selection and fill the order.</p>
                <p>In the spring 1945 I was transferred to Washington with the Bureau of Naval
                    Personnel, Navy Department, where I again was in what you might say was the
                    central management of the duty selection process over the country. I made a lot
                    of field trips to particular stations to see how things were going. I was
                    demobilized in February of 1946. A trip to a Navy conference in San Francisco in
                    January had allowed me to go up to Salem, Oregon and be interviewed for the
                    position of State Civil Service Director and I was selected for the position
                    prior to leaving military service. I reported to Salem two days following
                    demobilization.</p>
                <p>For the first time, I had state-wide personnel management jurisdiction over all
                    the departments. In Missouri and Louisiana my duties had been confined to the
                    merit system mandated agencies by the Federal Government under the Social
                    Security Act. Again in Oregon, I started from scratch and got rules set up and
                    positions classified. The governor already had the Civil Service Commission
                    comprised of three members, the chairman of which was Samuel Chambers. They had
                    contracted with the Public Administration Service (PAS) to classify the jobs in
                    the state government, so that was pretty well underway. We proceeded and set up
                    the rules, the salary ranges, and the examination processes by which registers
                    would be set up and so forth. I arrived there in early 1946 and left in the
                    summer of 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got quite a bit done in one year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: It was fifteen months. I arrived in Salem in February of 1946 and left in
                    June of 1947. I came back to Washington and settled down in the same apartment
                    building at 14th and Clifton Streets, in which I had lived when I was stationed
                    in the Navy Department. I began looking around for employment and I was told
                    that Sam Board, a personnel recruiter for the State Department, was looking for
                    a personnel and civil service experienced person to assist in modernizing the
                    Greek government in Athens, as a part of President Truman's program for aiding
                    Greece and Turkey in their post-war rehabilitation endeavors. So I was selected
                    to go over as a Personnel Specialist in the American Mission for Aid to Greece
                    (AMAG).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is to Athens?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>COLMAN: Athens, yes. There, for the first time, I met Hubert R. (Hugh) Gallagher.
                    He was the Director of the Civil Government division of the Mission. The Chief
                    of Mission was Dwight Griswold, former Governor of Nebraska. He and Gallagher
                    had known each other in connection with the Council of State Governments for
                    whom Gallagher had worked in prior years. Hugh asked me to be his deputy, I
                    don't think we ever had more than four or five people working in the division.
                    He was number one and I was number two. I conducted a general survey of what the
                    personnel situation was in the Greek government. Of course there was a lot of
                    patronage. Also, they had copied several aspects of French Civil Service in
                    earlier years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were dealing with a French model?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: A French model and also British to some extent, and I will always
                    remember my first meeting with Minister of Finance Helmis, who you might say was
                    really the minister of administration for the Greek government. He looked after
                    financial, personnel and central management matters. He was explaining the
                    greatness and the competence of the Greek personnel system. He said that the war
                    had been a very disorganizing influence, but that before the war Greece had been
                    recognized as “one of the very best personnel systems in all of the Balkans!” (I
                    had naively been expecting him to say “Europe”.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the best personnel systems in all of the
                        Balkans!!!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: All of the Balkans. This was an important transition point for me in two
                    respects: The transition into working abroad; and the opportunity within the
                    field of public administration central management that might allow me to get
                    over into organization and management as well as personnel issues.</p>
                <p>On another occasion, the Greek Government came to Hugh and said, “We've got a
                    terrible mess here in the Ministry of Public Works and we would like you to have
                    a look taken at that.” We looked at organization structure and so forth and made
                    some recommendations, a few of which were, I think, adopted. An interesting
                    conference occurred between Gallagher and the Minister of Public Works, his name
                    being Nicoliades. There was a lot of duplication in the field offices of the
                    Public Works Ministry and Mr. Gallagher was kind of impatient. He said, “Mr.
                    Minister don't you realize that that's poor administration?” The Minister
                    replied, “Of course it's poor administration, Greece is a poor country!” I
                    remained in Greece for about a year, arriving over there in August of 1947 and
                    coming back to Washington in July of 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt a minute Bill, and ask, before you leave
                        Greece. What did you find, say, on the personnel system; what did you do?
                        Did you try to convert it all to a US model or did you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>COLMAN: As the expression goes, “That's a very good question.” That was my first
                    instinct, but I discovered that it was a serious mistake and I again tried to
                    help the Greeks develop an improved system based on their own history and
                    culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe we were talking about your experience with the
                        Greek Personnel System and you were making some comments. I think you said
                        you had written an article about it, Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes, I did. The article was entitled, “Civil Service Reform in Greece”
                    and published in the Public Personnel Review, which was a publication of the
                    Civil Service Assembly of the United States and Canada, 1313 East 60th Street in
                    Chicago. The title of the article as I submitted it was “Civil Service Reform in
                    Greece: A Failure!” The editorial staff refused to publish it unless those two
                    words, “a failure” were removed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't want to admit to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: They didn't want to admit that civil service systems failed. Now, there
                    were a lot of things wrong with the civil service system in Greece. Immediately
                    after we got there, several things were apparent. They were over-staffed, they
                    were inefficient, and the civil service was not capable of carrying on the
                    day-to-day operations of the Government, not to mention the expanded (and
                    remember civil war between two major factions was going on at that time) the
                    expanded and vigorous military and economic programs needed.</p>
                <p>The most pressing problem was a requested increase in civil service salaries by
                    the Greek Government since employee unions were threatening to strike if their
                    demands were not met. After we had negotiations, a compromise was reached with
                    the understanding that the Greek Government would put a freeze on all new
                    appointments, reduce civil service strength by 15,000 positions, eliminate
                    overtime pay and reduce pay for serving on committees and finally, last but not
                    least, an increase in the work week from 25 hours to 40 hours. Of course we
                    wonder where we got the 40 hours. The answer; United States. The most important
                    lesson that I learned about technical assistance to foreign countries from the
                    experience in Greece was that it is a terrible mistake to try to transplant the
                    practices and structures and so forth from federal, state, and local governments
                    in the United States over into another country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt there? If you don't transplant then what
                        do you do?</hi>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>COLMAN: You try to look at the needs that country is facing and ask yourself the
                    question, “Starting all over to deal with this particular question, how ought we
                    to organize it?” and not think well let's pass a Civil Service Law that provides
                    A, B, C, copied out of a statute from Illinois or some other state, or the US
                    federal government.</p>
                <p>Another major question, and this still, I believe, pervades our foreign
                    Assistance to other nations: “To what extent should the United States Government
                    require, or demand that countries receiving economic aid to take steps to
                    improve or modify governmental practices?” That's a major question. If the
                    answer to that is yes, then should the United States try to lay down detailed
                    plans or should it confine itself to objectives and ask for the reaching of the
                    objectives by such means as the sovereign country would decide? The tendency of
                    a lot of people, and I discovered this not only in Greece but in the ECA
                    technical assistance program, that too many of our people are transplanting or
                    trying to. That tendency is very understandable, but the main lesson that I
                    learned from my Greek experience, was the necessity for flexible approaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. What do you think generally? Do you feel that
                        you and Hugh Gallagher and others—do you think you made a difference in
                        Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. We stirred things up and got them to recognize that they ought to
                    make some changes. The pressure was kept on by our successors, our mutual friend
                    Ford Luikart, for example. They adopted some legislation, those things they
                    agreed to do that I mentioned a minute ago, about changing the work week and so
                    on. My understanding is that in a later year they passed a civil service act of
                    some sort, but with more rhetoric than substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: They moved off the dime and so some progress was made. It certainly gave
                    me a big dose of caution for future matters of that kind. When I came back to
                    the US I asked about the details of the Marshall Plan and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Marshall Plan had been passed while you were in
                        Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: That's correct. In the summer of 1948, when I returned I went to the ECA
                    headquarters in the Miatico building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Economic Cooperation Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes, headed by Paul Hoffman, former president of the Studebaker Company.
                    I applied in the Organization and Management (O&amp;M) Division because I had
                    gotten into organization matters in Greece, and I wanted to broaden my public
                    administration experience. The person who interviewed me was Robert Rupard. He
                    thought that the fact that I had the organizational experience in Greece and had
                    been in the various executive positions in personnel management in the United
                    States might qualify me in O&amp;M. The head of the O&amp;M Division, Harry
                    Fite, who had joined the organization from the Budget Bureau, interviewed me and
                    appointed me as both an analyst, and as an assistant to him in running the
                    division. The division was one of four reporting to the Director of
                    Administration, who was Donald Stone. The other divisions making up the whole
                    administrative area were Personnel, Budget, and Administrative Services. The
                    Personnel Division was headed by Virgil Couch and I forget who was head of the
                    Budget Division at that time though we had adjoining offices. The Administrative
                    Services head was Orbun Powell.</p>
                <p>I began work there with the O&amp;M Division and we tackled various management
                    problems that would arise in divisions throughout the agency and go in and look
                    at them and make some recommendations. For example, we had a system of personnel
                    ceilings for the various organizational units of ECA; the Budget Bureau was
                    imposing agency personnel ceilings throughout the Government at that time. Don
                    Stone would have periodic meetings with the division heads under him about how
                    to handle the personnel caps. At O&amp;M, along with Budget, we looked at
                    various divisions and departments, giving them suggestions as to how they could
                    meet the personnel caps and still get their jobs done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you did that. Did this give you an
                        opportunity to help them perhaps improve their operations, organize
                        better?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. For example, we devised and helped set up a small unit in the agency
                    called the Program Methods Control Staff (PMCS). For quite a while they would
                    develop new forms, and they would develop various program processes for
                    different departments. But they were not part of the Department of
                    Administration. They were a part of what fell under Tyler Wood, the Assistant
                    Administrator for Operations. Dick Bissell was Assistant Administrator for
                    Programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Don Stone asked me to give some study to the provision of the Economic
                    Cooperation Act that dealt with technical assistance. That was a very brief
                    subsection but as far as Western Europe was concerned, we would try to give
                    assistance wherever we could in the reconstruction problems and rehabilitation
                    problems that those countries were facing. A separate part of that, at the
                    outset it was separate. The British and the US had agreed to form an
                    Anglo-American Productivity Council and my recollection is that it was pushed by
                    Philip Reed, President of General Electric, who had been in some conversations
                    with British industrialists. They thought it would be a good idea, and I think
                    took it up with Hoffman, and thought it would be a good idea to have that. So it
                    was formed with a small council made up of US and British officials, comprising
                    not just public sector but some private sector people in there too. It was a
                    discrete part of the ECA Technical Assistance Division.</p>
                <p>I thought that the technical assistance provision had great importance, and I
                    sent Stone some memoranda on it. I don't know what the internal discussions
                    were, but Hoffman decided that there ought to be a division of technical
                    assistance (TA) and that was assigned to the jurisdiction of Ty Wood, who was
                    head of Operations. When you give technical assistance, you bring people to this
                    country and take them around to see our processes, and you send our experts to
                    other countries. That's an operational thing. A very able person out of the
                    General Counsel's Office, William (B.Y.) Hoff, was named head of that division
                    and he recruited an assistant working in Don Stone's office, Jack Fobes. Hoff
                    set about organizing the TA division and because of these papers that I had
                    written for Stone, he asked me to take over the operations side of the division
                    and Jack Fobes would take over the program side. That may seem like an overlap,
                    but the way it was divided was that a decision would be made over on the Program
                    side that we ought to let half a dozen teams from half a dozen countries come
                    over here and look at such-and-such a subject and make that offer known through
                    our missions abroad. Then the handling of these people and working up of the
                    itineraries and so on would be over on my side—Operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I had a staff, I guess, of about thirty program managers. I had four
                    sections. For the handling of people coming in—every delegation that came over—a
                    project manager would be in charge. Sometimes they would handle more than one
                    delegation at a time, because if it were a fairly simple itinerary they, after
                    making advance arrangements, would let one of the people in the delegation kind
                    of look after the rest. Sometimes, not very often, but sometimes a Project
                    Manager would be handling two or even three different projects at the same time.
                    In terms of personnel, that was the largest of the sections. I had a recruitment
                    section of two or three professionals to work with the Personnel Division in
                    getting the right kind of American experts that the overseas country had asked
                    for.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>A third section had to do with, you might say, the logistics and other supporting
                    services, such as what visiting delegations would need in such-and-such a field.
                    What kind of books ought they be provided, and what kind of other services. That
                    section was tied in with the Budget Bureau Division, headed by Bernie Rosen,
                    whose job it was to be a reservoir of knowledge about how the US Government
                    worked. Finally we had the equivalent of a fourth section—the Anglo-American
                    Productivity Council, located in New York City. I visited it there on an average
                    of every ten days or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Bernie Rosen also supervise the people that came to
                        be trained at the Bureau of the Budget?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: That's correct. The head of our section that handled visiting delegations
                    was Elliot Hanson. He was succeeded by Ted Weems. The recruitment section was
                    under Mr. Gale, and he was always called Biff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Biff Gale, I had forgotten him, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: He was in a lot of hot water and was transferred out shortly after I left
                    the TA division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember the details.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: We got him transferred out. The logistics person was Al Hurt, close to,
                    but different from the orchestra leader Hirt's name. What I have just described
                    were the three Washington sections of the operations side of the TA Division.
                    The fourth section—the Productivity Council in New York covered both operational
                    and program matters. We handled a lot of visiting officials from both public and
                    private sectors in Western Europe. We would all the time be discovering better
                    ways to implement technical assistance policies. And here again my staff and I,
                    warned others about the transplanting concept. Our job was to inform
                    participating countries of our practices and ways in which they might and might
                    not be applicable to their situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: To acknowledge and remember that we were dealing with sovereign nations
                    and their sense of pride, ambition and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don Stone; although he was not your supervisor, didn't he
                        keep a kind of a very close touch with the organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. He certainly was interested in it. Occasionally when we would run
                    into disputes with other parts of the agency—for example, there was an office of
                    labor advisors under Clint Golden to begin with and I forget who took his place,
                    but incidentally, Clint Golden was our labor person in Greece. He came back and
                    headed up, for a time, the Labor Relations Office in ECA and then his deputy
                    took over. But anyway, if a nation wanted to learn better how to do certain
                    things, some of the best places for them to learn often would be in unionized
                    plants, but other aspects would be in non-unionized firms. The labor division
                    wanted to rule that foreign visitors would not be taken into any non-unionized
                    plants in the United States and between Hoff and myself and Stone and Ty Wood
                    and Hoffman, that was quashed. As a compromise it was agreed that if the
                    itinerary developed for a visiting team covered mostly non-union plants, the
                    labor division would add some unionized ones for a better balance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a recording with William Colman. I should have
                        said the date is May 8, 1996, but we will put that in later at the beginning
                        of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I was with the Technical Assistance Division from 1949, when I entered
                    it, to the fall of 1950 when I was recruited by Edgar Johnson, the head of the
                    Korean program in the ECA to go over with Chief Meyer, the newly appointed chief
                    of mission as his deputy. I would like to ask Marge a question here. Was Chief
                    his proper name?</p>
                <p>MARGE: No, his name was Clarence.(Marjorie A. Van Auken joined the ECA mission in
                    Seoul, Korea as a secretary shortly after its establishment, and, along with
                    most of the ECA staff was evacuated from Seoul to Japan, within a few days after
                    the outbreak of the Korean War in June, 1950. A small core staff was set up in
                    Pusan, as the China-supported North Korean army moved through Seoul and occupied
                    most of the peninsula. Within Japan she was transferred to the ECA Field Office
                    in Tokyo and became secretary to the Director. Upon the arrival of a new Chief
                    of Mission and the decision to conduct the downsizing and eventual liquidation
                    of the ECA Mission in South Korea from the Tokyo office, she became secretary to
                    the Acting Chief of Mission. She and Colman were married in 1954.)</p>
                <p>COLMAN: Clarence and they called him Chief.</p>
                <p>MARGE: It was because there was a baseball pitcher in the big leagues named
                    Clarence E. Meyer and they called him Chief Meyer.</p>
                <p>COLMAN: Well that was his usual name. The reason that you were thinking I spent
                    time over there and so on and how I managed to forget the name of this person.
                    Well in World War II he had been captured by the Japanese at the outset of the
                    war. He was an oil industrialist and...</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. He was running a big oil operation in the far east and he was
                    captured and held in a Japanese prison camp for about two years. The prior Chief
                    of Mission over there, and I have forgotten who that was Marge, before Meyer
                    came over there. Who was the big boss? Do you remember?</p>
                <p>MARGE: Arthur Bunce; but the mission largely scattered, upon its evacuation from
                    Seoul early in the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is before the Korean war broke out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: No. I arrived in Japan/Korea shortly after the second allied retreat from
                    Seoul. What was the name of the river up there at the border?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Yalu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: The Yalu; the retreat from the Yalu was going on. Chief Meyer and I went
                    over to Seoul, Korea. No, we didn't go on the same plane, but we got there
                    roughly at the same time. We went over to have a session with John Muccio, the
                    US Ambassador to South Korea. The Chinese and North Koreans were getting pretty
                    close and Chief Meyer went into Muccio's bedroom and saw that all over the
                    Ambassador's bed were valises packed, leading Meyer to think he was ready to get
                    the hell out! Meyer recalled his prisoner period with the Japanese. In the
                    meantime there was a big row going on in the U.N. about the critical military
                    situation in Korea. Meyer said that he was not willing to undertake this
                    assignment and would I be willing to stay in and run the show?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I said all right, provided that Edgar Johnson and people back in
                    Washington would okay the arrangement. They did and Chief Meyer left in a few
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say, “run the show,” what was the Economic
                        Cooperation Administration Program doing at that point?</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>COLMAN: On the point of partial liquidation because it looked like South Korea
                    might very well be, if not defeated, occupied. We had all kinds of contracts out
                    for raw materials and various other things. On the logistical side we worked
                    hand-in-glove with the G4 part of the military establishment of MacArthur's. The
                    US Military occupation of Japan (SCAP) was still in existence. MacArthur was
                    still “God Almighty,” and Japan hadn't yet formed its own government. That
                    didn't come for a year or so later. We had to reduce our personnel. We had to
                    cancel contracts. We had to divert shipments headed for our Mission in Korea to
                    Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei and other ECA missions.</p>
                <p>MARGE: Bill, you are forgetting that meeting in Manila right after you got there.
                    You went down to Manila and met with the Mission Chiefs and everybody wanted
                    cars. They didn't care about two by fours. They all wanted cars.</p>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. That was both an information and deal making conference. We had the
                    Mission Chiefs from the Far East in there. We explained the situation to them,
                    “Here are our orders and here are the personnel and so on, and who wants what?”
                    Then about a month or two or three or four after that we had a similar meeting
                    with the Mission Chiefs in Tokyo, to wrap up some more things. Essentially it
                    was to protect property and to get out of there in an orderly way and get the
                    personnel redeployed. Of course there were some ongoing things in which part
                    delivery had been made and where it could be made by getting into the Pusan
                    Harbor. That was the only way you could get it over there. The Japanese were
                    very cooperative in some respects. They would transfer funds over there via the
                    Japanese and Korean banking systems.</p>
                <p>My time was about two thirds in Tokyo, maybe three fourths, and the rest over in
                    Pusan. The dozen or so staff members in Pusan were under the immediate
                    supervision of Allan Loren, who reported to me. There was a get-away plan that
                    if Pusan got overrun, Korean military and civil personnel would go to Chegu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an island off of Korea obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: An island off of South Korea. I saw it in the paper, reading about it the
                    other day. The plan was for the officials and the records and so on, both Korean
                    and US in the office over in Pusan, to get on this ship. One of the staff people
                    took me to the ship and I've got a picture of it. In fact I've got a whole album
                    of pictures of these countries that I'm describing. Anytime your curiosity gets
                    overpowering I imagine I have a picture of the get-away ship and many other
                    things and people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>COLMAN: We've got a picture of departure day for MacArthur en route to the
                    airport, having got his butt kicked out of SCAP leadership. Well, pictures that
                    you would naturally take at exciting times. Edgar Johnson wrote me a highly
                    complimentary letter about how well the liquidation had been executed. I ran
                    onto the letter, I had forgotten all about it, here yesterday or the day before,
                    when I was going through these papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt you? Harlan Cleveland wasn't associated
                        with the program anymore at that point. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Harlan ran the China program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: China. I see. So he had nothing to do with the
                        Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: He had nothing to do, at that time, with the program. Now when I went
                    back with Ty to help set up a new mission in South Korea Harlan was in a
                    position up, I think, in Bissell's earlier post of Assistant Administrator for
                    Program. During my first tour in Tokyo and Korea, Paul Hoffman had been
                    succeeded by William Foster and ECA changed to MSA—Mutual Security Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. I didn't mean to get you off your stride
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I remember writing a letter to Harlan in that capacity that he was in
                    from over in Seoul about some things that I thought were going badly wrong in
                    the Far Eastern setup, mostly political, stuff about Chiang Kai-shek and so on.
                    Harlan was not in the picture at the time of my first tour. Edgar Johnson was,
                    you might say, the equivalent of a State Department Desk Officer for Korea, and
                    the Far East was in the charge of Allen Griffin.</p>
                <p>MARGE: Harlan was with UNRRA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARGE: ...in Shanghai because that's where I first ran across him and then he
                    went to the, what we called the “Gravy Train,” in China—the China Program. He
                    was over there in a civilian capacity.</p>
                <p>COLMAN: He was running the China program when I was in the Technical Assistance
                    Division, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So when you finished...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Harlan was in a back and forth situation with UNRRA and running the ECA
                    aid to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you finished in Korea you came back to the
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I came back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you come back to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I came back to the Federal Civil Defense Administration. That was after
                    about two months in MSA headquarters. There were a number of things that Griffin
                    wanted to really get updated on and things that some other missions... Oh!
                    Another thing; In the Spring of 1951, Griffin, Ed Arnold and others wanted me to
                    look in on two or three ECA missions in the Far East. For that brief period they
                    added something onto my title about Far Eastern Representative and in July 1951,
                    when I left a man by the name of Arganoff took over these duties. He resigned, I
                    think, about two months after I had come back to the United States. This had to
                    do not only with the liquidation—there would be occasional liquidation things
                    tied into Korea, money and so on—but this was to look at things that Griffin was
                    concerned about. I remember going to Taipei and spending two or three days with
                    Raymond Moyer and went down to the Philippines again and spent a little time
                    with whoever was in charge down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably Vincent Checchi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARGE: Was that Vince Checchi?</p>
                <p>COLMAN: We got a telegram from Vince Checchi in the course of this personnel
                    redeployment. We sent somebody on their way to Manila and a cable came back
                    about this individual, I have forgotten who it was, from Checchi—”Why was he
                    dispatched?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dispatched?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>COLMAN: Yes. Why was he showing up in Manila? Either at Checchi's end or my end
                    there was a screw up, I don't know which. I spent a month or so when I got back
                    with Griffin chasing down a few things and then Hugh Gallagher stepped into the
                    picture again. A Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA) had been
                    established as an independent agency of the Federal government. Civil defense
                    was a big thing at the time. He said come over and be my deputy. Millard
                    Caldwell, former Governor of Florida, was named chief of the organization. Ralph
                    Spear was over there and also Joe Chambers. I don't know whether that rings a
                    bell with you or not. He got the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery in one
                    of the island landings in World War II. Hugh headed the Field Operations
                    Divisions of FCDA and wanted me to be his deputy and to organize regional FCDA
                    field offices over the country as a part of readying the country for defense
                    against foreign attack.</p>
                <p>We went by common regional lines e.g. New England. We recruited Regional Civil
                    Defense Directors. We had about twelve of them. I was chasing around recruiting
                    and then working with the regional directors on getting their offices set up. A
                    lot of legislative stuff in their own regions—how to deal with the governor and
                    legislature of the states in their region. We wanted to get the National Guard
                    more involved and so did the Executive Office of the President. I spent about a
                    year with FCDA from October 1951, to September 1952. It was about eleven months.
                    At that time another person, another former boss, captured me and that was Bill
                    Hoff, who had been head of the Technical Assistance Division in ECA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: During all of the war planning that had gone on during the Korean War—he
                    helped set up the Office of Defense Mobilization (ODM) and the Defense
                    Production Administration (DPA). One of the issues closely tied in with civil
                    defense but not dealt with in FCDA—How you recover from an atomic attack? How do
                    you best prepare yourself for the worst?; and then, how do you come out of it as
                    quickly as possible? The job was to develop an index of vulnerabilities to
                    attack. It was called the Post Attack Production Staff. I joined that staff as a
                    consultant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: No. These were independent agencies. The ODM was given general directions
                    by the Executive Office of the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I was with them, and at that time I had shifted over to a daily basis of
                    consulting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Then you went back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: I was with Hoff from September 1952 until January 1953 when I shifted
                    over to the ODM and served there until August of that year and that's when Ty
                    Wood called me back into the foreign aid program—to go with him to Korea and
                    help him set up a new economic mission. The Korean War had ended with an
                    armistice, and North and South were in a semi-peaceful mode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is C. Tyler Wood, not to be confused with Tighe
                        Wood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Right. After the armistice agreement was signed, not a peace agreement.
                    (That has been emphasized here lately in 1996 in connection with US-North Korea
                    negotiations, that what ended the Korean war was not a peace but an armistice.)
                    It seemed logical to reestablish an Economic Mission to Korea and treat it like
                    other friendly countries, regarding economic assistance. Ty asked me if I would
                    go over and help him set it up and partially recreate the earlier mission. I
                    left and went with Ty in August of 1953 and I came back in November of 1953, so
                    that was just a short period over there, but it was a formative period. It
                    worked very fast and I think pretty effectively. The foreign aid agency was now,
                    in the early days of the Eisenhower administration, the Foreign Operation
                    Administration (FOA), under the leadership of former Minnesota Harold
                    Stassen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were setting up in effect a brand new
                        mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: That's right. We were stationed in Seoul, living in the Chosun Hotel and
                    dealing on a daily basis with South Korean officials. During the other period I
                    perhaps had met with President Syngman Rhee no more than two or three times in
                    that period of commuting between Tokyo and Pusan. In 1953 we could get right
                    down to business with the top Korean officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very good that you had that access to President
                        Rhee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: We had some very useful assistance from the US military. It had taken
                    over the remaining odds and ends of the MSA mission. Upon our arrival in 1953,
                    we found that we had inherited several very able military people and they helped
                    us set things up. Max Taylor was still commanding the 8th Army over there but
                    they were in a peace keeping role at that time rather than a combat one. Also,
                    some people in the former ECA posts in Korea, Japan and elsewhere came back and
                    joined Ty Wood's staff. I came back to FOA Washington in November 1953.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: Oh yes. I specified that it would just be a start-up kind of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLMAN: 1953 to 1954. I was asked by Al Roseman to join his staff as a consultant
                    to study their operations. I was asked by him to assess the work that was being
                    done in the Division, I guess the report was somewhat critical because he
                    thought it was too critical. I had completed the job. Oh, and in the interim
                    when I was still with Ty Wood, I think it was in that period, Don Stone had
                    tried to get me to come back and head up the Personnel Department. Virgil Couch
                    had left. I wrote Don that I just didn't want to get back into central
                    management. I was through with central management types of activity, and why
                    didn't he take a look at Bob Rupard? Don wrote a letter back saying that he had
                    always taken my advice and that this time he was appointing Bob. I read this
                    letter yesterday. I had forgotten it existed, but I remember it now.</p>
                <p>After I finished that report for Roseman, I saw a new employment opportunity and
                    that was with a commission on intergovernmental relations. Eisenhower had
                    promised Robert Taft that if he were elected he would set up a commission to
                    look at the division of powers and responsibilities between the national
                    government and the states.</p>
