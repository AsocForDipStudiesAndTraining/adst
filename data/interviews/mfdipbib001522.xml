                <p>DR. ROBERT R. BOWIE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Robert Gerald Livingston, Philipp Gassert, Richard Immerman, Paul
                    Steege, Charles Stuart Kennedy and a public audience at the German Historical
                    Institute, Washington, DC</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 19, 2008</p>
                <p>Copyright 2008 ADST</p>
                <p>Q-Gassert: Dr. Bowie, welcome to the Institute. My name is Philipp Gassert, and
                    I'm the Deputy Director here. We're really pleased that this event worked out
                    today. Thanks to Gerry for taking the initiative and bringing such an
                    interesting panel together. We are not only in the business of studying history,
                    but we also create history, for example, in oral history interviews, so we're
                    really glad we can host this event. It is, I think, part of a long lineage and
                    series of bringing in former decision-makers who have been involved in making
                    history now in order to have a discussion, to have conversations, with
                    historians who were studying past events. That's all I have to say. Most of us
                    here know the institute and also know those who are presenting. We tried to keep
                    this group small so that we would have more of the benefit of the taping for
                    those who want to hear the questions of the historians. Without further ado, I
                    would like then to turn over the panel to Gerry Livingston, and I would also
                    like to thank you once again for taking the initiative and organizing this
                    wonderful event.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Pleasure, thank you, Philipp. Actually, this goes back, Bob, to a
                    dinner you were at in the Fogg Museum at Harvard a few months ago at the
                    fiftieth anniversary of the Center for International Affairs there, which Bob
                    founded in 1958. And, Karl Kaiser was there and was very impressed with his
                    conversation. Let me just very briefly, because we want to get started,
                    introduce everybody at the table one after the other. In the middle is Charles
                    Stuart Kennedy, Stu Kennedy, who is director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History
                    Project, which we're linking up with here for the purpose of this discussion. He
                    founded it twenty years ago, and he's interviewed, what, 200, 300 diplomats?</p>
                <p>Q-Kennedy: Oh, we've got about 1700 so far.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: 1700 diplomats!</p>
                <p>Q-Kennedy: ...so far. It's not just me. We have others doing it. But 1700...the
                    first thousand are on the Internet.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: The project is archived at the Library of Congress. He was a
                    diplomat himself for 30 years and served in Frankfurt and Dhahran and Saigon,
                    Athens and Seoul, and I guess as a final nice gesture you served in Naples,
                    right?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Q-Kennedy: Just in time for an earthquake. (laughter)</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Good time at the end! (Pause) Then right to my immediate left is
                    Bob Bowie, the star of today, and let me just quote. That's all I have to do is
                    quote what Thomas Schwartz, who submitted some of the questions that are on the
                    list you have, wrote in his book America's Germany about McCloy in Germany. This
                    is a quote: “Razor-sharp mind and skill in negotiation made him, Bowie, McCloy's
                    most important and influential advisor, especially in matters relating to
                    European integration.” Bob comes from an old Maryland family and started as a
                    lawyer in Baltimore, where we picked him up today, or just outside of Baltimore.
                    Served in the army in the Pentagon and worked under General Lucius Clay there.
                    1945 to 46 he went with General Clay to Germany, then taught law at Harvard and,
                    with a leave of absence from 1950 to 1952, went to serve in Germany with McCloy
                    as legal advisor. Then he became director of the policy-planning staff in the
                    Department of State under President Eisenhower from 1953 to 1957 succeeding Paul
                    Nitze. Later, he became counselor of the State Department in the 1960s and
                    Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1977 to 1979. Way on my
                    left is a colleague of Bob's. Bob published three books, and among them was a
                    book published in 2000 with Richard Immerman from Temple University on how
                    Eisenhower shaped Cold War policy, the enduring Cold War policy. It's called
                    Waging Peace: How Eisenhower Shaped an Enduring Cold War Strategy. Second from
                    the left is Paul Steege of Villanova, an historian of Berlin in the postwar
                    years. His most recent book is Black Market, Cold War: Everyday Life in Berlin,
                    19461949. It's just been published, and there was an event at the Woodrow Wilson
                    Center that some of you may have been at a few days ago. I'm going to ask Stu to
                    start with the very first question. This is all being taped. When we address
                    Bob, please speak right at him, speak loudly, and if you don't speak loudly
                    enough, I'll yell at him (laughter). So we hope after we go around with some
                    introductory questions, we'll throw the floor open to your questions, and away
                    we go. [To Kennedy]: Stu Kennedy.</p>
                <p>Q-Kennedy: Yes, it's nice to be back here after our last conversation, which was
                    twenty years ago! Bob, talking about the time when you went out to Berlin for
                    the first time with Clay: could you speak a little bit about how well you and
                    your colleagues were prepared to deal with the immense problems of
                    reconstructing Germany?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Let me just say before I start that I'm as deaf as a post and I have a
                    hard time hearing in a room like this, which has terrible echoes, and so I may
                    have to ask for repetition. But anyway, I have this one. I would say that in
                    terms of how well prepared we were for doing what the job was was nil
                    (laughter). I had no background whatever with respect to Germany except having
                    traveled there when I was an undergraduate in college, and I went abroad
                    frequently in the summertime. I had traveled there then. But it did not in any
                    way prepare me for any duties with respect to Germany. Really, Clay, if you
                    looked at his record, had very few special qualifications for dealing with
                    Germany. He didn't speak German, his wartime experience had been entirely in the
                    Pentagon, in charge of the procurement for the war. He did spend just a few
                    days, I think, on a special assignment in Germany, but that was about it. And he
                    did not have any background that would specially have qualified him. So I would
                    say that he made a point of getting some very excellent experts, especially from
                    the academic world, who knew all about Germany, and he was one of the most
                    intelligent, brightest men that I've ever worked with. We had all sorts of
                    materials that had been prepared particularly by the British with respect to
                    Germany, and certainly I studied those very hard just as soon as I knew I was
                    coming to Germany, but this was really book-learning, and I think Clay also had
                    done some of that sort of thing. But again, he had to learn on the job of what
                    his assignment would be. But as I say, he was a man who really was one of the
                    most impressive intellects. And he also thought very much strategically. So by
                    the time he'd gotten there and surveyed the situation and had read 1067, he
                    began to formulate in his own mind what his strategy would be and how he would
                    try to achieve it. Gerry said I was an advisor to Clay. I was a personal
                    assistant to Clay; I was not formally an advisor, but he was a man who was
                    impressive in the sense that he was a general and I was a major, and what he
                    wanted from an assistant was for you to speak up to him and tell him what you
                    thought and argue with him. And he would argue back, just forget all about rank.
                    It was just like a really intellectual talk, or real discussion, and he expected
                    you to speak up and say what you thought. Of course, civilly, and with proper
                    personal relationship. It was a wonderful assignment. There was one other man
                    who was in the same role, and when something was on Clay's mind and he wanted to
                    know more about it, he would give us an assignment and expect us to come back
                    with a report of maybe 10 or 12, 15 pages. And he would read the report almost
                    as fast as you could turn the pages and by the time he finished with it, he
                    would turn to you and he'd ask the most penetrating questions about what you had
                    said, and he would almost always hit the real point which was worth talking
                    about. As I say, what he wanted you to do was to give and take. So it was a very
                    satisfying kind of role.</p>
                <p>Q-Kennedy: All right. Thank you. I'm going to switch seats now and let you two
                    gentlemen move over [to Steege and Immerman].</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: So, Paul, why don't you move over, and we'll let you go on. And see
                    if we, in this first phase, stay with General Clay, if we can. Richard, you want
                    to move over a little closer? So pull the microphone close to you and also talk
                    directly to Bob.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q-Steege: Well, first off, thank you very much for this opportunity. It's a real
                    pleasure to be able to engage in this conversation with you. Building on this
                    notion of Clay and Clay on the ground, as it were, in Germany, one of the things
                    that really strikes me about your experiences is the ways in which you were
                    going back and forth. So you were in Berlin in 1945 and 1946, then back in the
                    States, in Germany from 1949 into the early 50s and then back in the United
                    States. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the different
                    perspectives—how Berlin looked from Berlin; how Berlin and Germany looked from
                    the United States. One foreign service veteran talked to me once about Clay and
                    others—and particularly on lower levels within the military government in
                    Germany—being afflicted by localitis—that they were too invested in the
                    situation there and that things looked different to them than they did from the
                    United States. So for you as somebody who was going back and forth, did the way
                    in which Germany looked change? Did it look different in the United States? Was
                    there a gap in terms of what people saw or understood from your perspective?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, I'm not sure I can answer it well, but anyway. When you were in
                    Germany at that time, right after the war, you found it hard to believe the
                    degree of disorganization and destruction and chaos. You'd go out on the street,
                    you'd see the rubble, and you were aware that there was no transportation, no
                    communication, no mail, no telephone, and you drove up the Autobahn, the roadway
                    was normally in place, but every time you got to a bridge it had been blown out.
                    So you had to go down into the valley, come up again on very improvised roads,
                    and similarly, whenever you came across a little town, it was being run by a
                    small detachment of maybe four or five soldiers from the Bronx, some of whom had
                    some German. But they were running the place, and they would mobilize enough of
                    the talent in the town to be able to try to make things go to some degree. But
                    bear in mind, the water supply had probably been broken by the bombing, there
                    was no collection of the garbage, no sewage, and no government, of course, and
                    so there was a real sense of chaos everywhere. I think probably back in
                    Washington, they didn't have any very clear picture of this. The initial
                    directive for the military government did not seem to reflect these conditions
                    (Clay had no part in drafting it), and it was fairly draconian. It was nowhere
                    near as bad as the Morgenthau Plan, which had been temporarily approved by
                    Roosevelt and was really later described as the pasturalization of Germany,
                    really wiping out the industrial base. But Stimson and others had said to
                    Roosevelt, he just couldn't do that, and then they adopted 1067, which was
                    intermediate. But even that was pretty draconian, and it called for no effort at
                    reconstruction of Germany and nothing should be done in that direction except to
                    prevent starvation, or such a degree of difficulty that it threatened the
                    occupation itself. So anyway, in Germany, you were keenly aware of this
                    situation as I described. The people in Washington, I think, had a hard time
                    visualizing this, such that to some considerable degree, you had bifurcation.
                    There were other complications regarding policy. One was the dual source of
                    instructions. As Deputy Military Governor, Clay reported to the Defense
                    Department. And at the same time, he was getting instructions from the State
                    Department. And this often created a considerable amount of tension. And the
                    second thing that affected policy was the Potsdam meeting which was held not
                    long after the end of the war. That was a three-power meeting, because the
                    French were not yet included in the occupation. And the Potsdam protocol was
                    somewhat more tempered than 1067. It provided that the recovery of Germany
                    should not be allowed to go further than would give the Germans a standard of
                    living comparable or similar to that of the rest of Europe, which was not very
                    high either at that time. But nevertheless, it wasn't anywhere near so rigid or
                    strict as 1067. The other thing which was later very important was that the
                    Potsdam agreement or protocol called for treating Germany as a unit, as a single
                    economic entity, because the original plans had provided for separate zones
                    within Germany for each of the occupying powers, and each of the military
                    governors was in charge of that sector of Germany. And the Potsdam agreement
                    also provided that there should be German administrative organizations,
                    agencies, for the various necessary functions, which would treat Germany as a
                    whole. There would be no German government, but these various agencies would be
                    jointly supervised by the Control Council of the various governors. So they
                    would be in control in the end, but they would use these German agencies as the
                    means of carrying them out. Very early on, Clay concluded that his objective was
                    to end up with a Germany which would be peaceful and not threatening, and that
                    in order to do that, it was necessary that it be sufficiently prosperous to at
                    least be able to have a decent living, and that there should be a great emphasis
                    on quickly restoring democracy, which would ultimately make it possible to turn
                    over to the Germans the governing of the country. So he felt that 1067 was too
                    constraining. And so he early started to try to restore economic life as best he
                    could because he thought that Germany could not possibly be peace-loving and
                    stable if it was down on its knees. And secondly, he wanted to start right away
                    to give Germans some experience with democracy, and so he was eager to get a
                    framework that he could use for proceeding rapidly with both those. He tried to,
                    in effect, interpret the instructions by writing an outline himself of what he
                    was doing with respect to early stages in the governing of Germany, and tried to
                    get it approved and put out. The State Department and Defense Departments said
                    no. [To Steege] Do you want me to go on now? [Steege nods.]</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Because they would not accept any modification of 1067, so he took another route.
                    He knew Jimmy Brynes—he had worked for some months before coming to Germany,
                    when Byrnes was in charge of war mobilization, in the White House, and had now
                    become Secretary of State. So he arranged with Byrnes to come to Germany and
                    essentially wrote him a speech which incorporated his conception of what ought
                    to be the policy. And Byrnes made that speech in Stuttgart in September 1946.
                    Essentially Clay used that as the basis for saying this is what our policy is.
                    So he really just circumvented the two departments back home. And, of course, in
                    my opinion, he was the one who had a rational and coherent policy which was
                    addressing both the early stages of democracy and the early stages of trying to
                    get some degree of economic revival.</p>
                <p>Q-Steege: Could I just follow up on that a little bit... I was really struck by
                    your comment about Clay and his manipulation of the Stuttgart speech by Byrnes
                    and wondered about how you would kind of map out causation, especially with the
                    relationship between Clay and Germans and particularly German politicians—to
                    what extent did they stimulate Clay in particular ways, or were they something
                    that Clay also used to pursue his ends? How would you explain that
                    relationship?</p>
                <p>BOWIE: You mean, his relationship with the Germans?</p>
                <p>Q-Steege: Yes, and the ways in which that then shaped his relationship with his
                    superiors.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, Clay was a genuine democrat. He really believed in democracy. His
                    father had been a senator, and he had been a pageboy in the Senate at one point.
                    So he had a very good political instinct. So, early on, within a few months
                    after he took over, he decided that he was going to name minister-presidents for
                    each of the L�nder (states) of his area. He named as minister-presidents people
                    who had been in the resistance or had not been tarred with the Nazi regime. And
                    he created a Council called the L�nderrat, composed of the minister-presidents,
                    which met regularly. He attended to give them instructions and for discussion
                    about conditions and problems. And he formed a fairly congenial relationship
                    because he insisted on give-and-take there, too. I mean, he sought their advice,
                    their information, and they became very cooperative. And he also instituted
                    having regular press conferences, where he encouraged the German press people,
                    to their amazement, to ask hard questions about things that they really wanted
                    to know. This was all demonstrating, as he was trying to do, what he thought
                    they ought to remember about democracy. When we moved to Berlin, he got to know
                    Reuter who had been a communist but who was anti-communist now, and formed a
                    high respect for him</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I think Clay was committed to carrying out the various requirements which had
                    been set out in 1067 and also in Potsdam. Essentially there were four D's: there
                    was denazification, demilitarization, the destruction of war-making potential,
                    and then a deconcentration of the large enterprises, particularly in the Ruhr.
                    And he was quite prepared to carry out those policies, but he wanted to do so in
                    a fashion which would return some degree of understanding of democracy and also,
                    as I say, restore a viable living standard, because the living standards were
                    terrible. In addition to the environment which I described, there was a severe
                    shortage, as there was in much of Europe, of food. The theoretical ration for
                    the people was twelve hundred calories, and that was often not fulfilled because
                    the farmers who had some grain on their farms didn't want to part with that
                    because there was nothing to buy and the currency was no good. So it was a very
                    tight problem with respect to food, and it was necessary to import a great deal
                    of the food from the United States.</p>
                <p>But coming back to the relations between Clay and the Germans, it was, I think, a
                    very cooperative one, in which he tried to give the feeling that he respected
                    them and that they were expected to respond, and they did.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Let's stay with the Clay period. Richard, do you have any
                    particular questions on the Clay period? I think if we could stay, do, divide in
                    that way, stick with one period...</p>
                <p>Q-Immerman: Well, if you want to talk about Clay—I don't want to talk about the
                    Clay period, so, in other words, you can go on. As I said, I actually wanted to
                    build on that and move forward chronologically, but if you want to...</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Sure, sure! Go ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Q-Immerman: Well, I'm curious, building on what you just said...But first let me
                    say how nice it is to see you again. In fact, I believe Bob and I were together
                    last at George Kennan's hundredth birthday party, which says something about
                    something. You've just provided us with an extremely detailed assessment of what
                    was going on on the ground in Germany in 1946, 47, the origins of the Cold War.
                    In 1953, you're back in Washington, and—now the biography should be corrected
                    because I think that's important. Bob was not only director of the policy
                    planning staff; he was the State Department representative on the Planning Board
                    of the National Security Council, the board that was working on policy. One of
                    these questions has to do with Solarium and things like that, and Bob was
                    directly involved. This is a period, basically transition from the Stalin note
                    to the elections in Germany in 1953; the proposal to establish the European
                    Defense Community; statements about agonizing reappraisal and other things that
                    are all going on during this period. So my question is, when you come back to
                    Washington, to what extent does your experience in Germany, your expertise in
                    Germany, and for that matter, anybody else's expertise in Germany, directly
                    influence policy as it is being evolved. And I particularly will put this in the
                    context of, let's say, the relationship between Eisenhower, who had direct
                    experience in Germany, and, let's say, Dulles, whose experience was much more
                    peripheral. So here you are now in the center of things. How much difference, do
                    you think, it makes that you actually arrive in that position having been
                    involved in what happened earlier with the negotiations over the European Coal
                    and Steel? I mean, you're right in the middle of everything. Does the
                    administration exploit your expertise?</p>
                <p>BOWIE: By early in 1953, when I joined the Eisenhower administration, the basic
                    policies toward Germany had been settled and were in progress. The Marshall Plan
                    had recognized that German revival was essential for European recovery. A
                    democratic government had been established with Adenauer as Chancellor. The
                    transition from occupation to sovereignty was underway. The European Coal and
                    Steel Community was to integrate Germany with Western Europe and reconcile
                    Germany and France. Adenauer solidly supported this course. He believed it would
                    lead to stable peace in Europe. And he was convinced it was the best way to
                    achieve ultimate reunification with Eastern Germany.</p>
                <p>The SPD, led by Schumaker, strongly anti-communist, opposed this policy. Instead,
                    with the millions of refugees from the East, he supported making reunification
                    the primary goal and rejected integration with the West as impeding it.</p>
                <p>Still unsettled was the critical issue of Germany's role in defense. Adenauer had
                    raised this question after the invasion of South Korea from the North, and
                    reports of Soviet military buildup in East Germany. Deeply concerned about
                    Germany's vulnerability, he insisted that the Germans should be able in some way
                    to contribute to their defense. NATO had only limited conventional forces,
                    depending heavily on U.S. nuclear forces for deterrence.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>After debating various alternatives, a consensus developed to negotiate a treaty,
                    based on a French proposal prepared by Monnet, for a European Defense Community.
                    That was now up for ratification. Dulles and Eisenhower, who strongly favored
                    European unity, sought to encourage its adoption but without success.</p>
                <p>To return to Richard's question: I was involved in the process of completing the
                    German policy, especially the EDC, and an alternative after its failure. But my
                    primary activity as Director of Policy Planning and member of the NSC Planning
                    Board was in drafting Eisenhower's Cold War strategy.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Paul, do you have any more questions on the earlier period? Or?</p>
                <p>Q-Steege: [to Immerman] Did you want to follow up on that? [Immerman shakes his
                    head]. The question I'd just ask, so, in 1953 the uprising in East Germany and,
                    what has come to light since 1989 certainly is the ways in which it was not just
                    in East Berlin but across all of East Germany, in hundreds of towns, and that
                    this really was a massive scale—was that something that was known to you and to
                    the Eisenhower administration at the time, this massive scale of the uprising,
                    and, does that matter, or not? Was that a transformative moment, in terms of
                    understanding either Germany or as a way of understanding the global strategic
                    situation in which the United States found itself?</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, this was obviously something which was a very great concern because
                    of two reasons: 1) the Eisenhower campaign had been urging more attention to the
                    liberation of Eastern Europe, and Dulles was particularly eager to do this, to
                    appeal to the votes which would be attracted by the idea of the liberation of
                    Eastern Europe. And one time during the campaign he made a speech which was
                    rather strong about how it was going to get these people free, and Eisenhower
                    called him and said, Look, you're perfectly free to argue for our concern about
                    Eastern Europe, but you must say always that any liberation would be by peaceful
                    means. So, I mean, Eisenhower had no question about this. He was not going to
                    have any idea that the United States was going to use force to get freedom for
                    East Europe. One of the other basic tenets of Eisenhower was that a nuclear war
                    would be an absolute suicidal disaster for both sides, and that therefore one of
                    his key purposes was to see to it that our effort to contain the Soviets not
                    lead to the possibility of direct conflict between the forces, because he felt
                    that if you had a real conflict between the two, it would almost surely
                    escalate, and be highly likely to go on until it got up into using nuclear
                    weapons. And, as I say, he thought that would be suicidal for both sides. He was
                    absolutely convinced that by threatening retaliation he could deter the Soviets
                    from using nuclear weapons and even from a large-scale attack. Earlier, when it
                    was discovered that the Soviets surprisingly had developed nuclear weapons much
                    sooner than expected, Truman had approved NSC 68. This was an analysis of what
                    this implied and concluded that when they got an adequate inventory of nuclear
                    weapons (by 1954), they would be tempted to use them to annihilate the United
                    States. And Eisenhower rejected this and was convinced that we could deter the
                    Soviet Union if we made them understand the consequences of any such event.
                    Nevertheless, he was fearful that if their regime or empire was really
                    threatened, then it might very well cause the happening of military
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>So, coming back now the uprising in Germany, certain people like C. D. Jackson
                    said, Oh, this is now a wonderful opportunity; we'll just exploit this to the
                    full. And some people were urging that we make weapons available to the people
                    who were carrying on the uprising. Eisenhower was opposed to this. He said, We
                    cannot create a situation in which they think their empire is threatened and we
                    cause actual, direct conflict between the two sides. That was also his attitude
                    even with the Hungarian problem; it was terrible to sit by and not do something,
                    and there were people who said we should at least take some effort to give them
                    weapons and support, but he said, No, he was not going to jeopardize the
                    possibility of peace, of any real conflict, that, agonizing as it was to see the
                    Russians overrunning Hungary, for example, or the putting down of the uprising
                    in Berlin and elsewhere in 1953, that was simply too risky, in his opinion, for
                    the longer term, for the maintenance of deterrence.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Could I ask, Bob, at this point, what about the intermediate stage?
                    What were Eisenhower's views, your own views, about covert action operations
                    such as Frank Wisner and others were running against Eastern Europe?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Under Truman, the CIA with the cooperation of the Policy Planning Staff
                    led by Kennan had carried on a number of covert actions with respect to Eastern
                    Europe. They dropped agents into Eastern Europe and similar activities with the
                    purpose of trying to create trouble. By the end of the Truman administration,
                    the CIA wrote a report saying—contrary to what had been the premise—that we
                    don't have the instruments and we don't have the means of carrying out any such
                    covert actions effectively, and it was foolish to keep on doing them.
                    Eisenhower's attitude was consistent with what I have said. He didn't see any
                    sense in using such covert activities; he didn't think they would work. At the
                    same time, he was quite prepared to use covert action on our side of the line
                    where he felt that governments were being subverted, and so, in various places,
                    he did use these, and sometimes it was rather doubtful wisdom, but nevertheless,
                    that was fundamentally his policy. So he wasn't opposed to using covert action,
                    but he didn't believe it was a useful way to deal directly with the Soviets, but
                    it was a way to deal with the threat of Soviet subversion on our side of the
                    line. (pause) Is that it?</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: That's it. (laughter) OK, Richard.</p>
                <p>Q-Immerman: I want to go back to that period, first of all, in the aftermath of
                    the Berlin uprisings in 1953, which, in a way, you indicated, were sort of a
                    non-event, that if anything had reinforced the predisposition of the
                    administration before that not to take any sort of aggressive or risky behavior
                    to support indigenous movements, and in this case, I think it was an indigenous
                    movement...but, I'm still trying to locate the space in which policy was, to
                    some extent, in flux. You mentioned earlier the difficulty of reconciling the
                    integration of Germany into the Western alliance, while at the same time
                    supporting, to some extent, the eventual unification of Germany and keeping
                    that, which, I think we can agree, was a very difficult balancing act for
                    decades. I wonder if you can comment, though, that just at this time in 1953, we
                    have Kennan, for the first time, explicitly proposing the potential
                    demilitarization of Germany, or the United States's withdrawal of Germany, in
                    part as a way of forcing the Soviets to reciprocate, and therefore moving the
                    Soviet forces from his view farther to the east, and that's followed almost
                    immediately by Dulles proposing similarly a withdrawal of both Western and
                    Soviet troops on the premise that the United States might, the West might never
                    again be in as strong a position as it is then to basically compel some type of
                    settlement through the middle of Europe. So I guess my question is, to what
                    extent was there still debate in Washington as to a) the sort of deployment of
                    US troops or NATO troops in Germany for the foreseeable future, or some sort of
                    effort at that point to either withdraw troops, neutralize Germany, some other
                    solution other than the one that turned out to be what was followed, and many
                    would argue was successful?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, I think that the view of those who had been arguing that the way to
                    deal with Germany was to integrate it was that if you tried to create a Germany
                    which was theoretically or really neutral, there was a real likelihood that the
                    Soviets by subversion would be able ultimately to become dominant in that whole
                    area. After all, of course, you'd had the whole period after the war of seeing
                    how the Soviets, when they got any real opportunity to do so, had been able to
                    really put the screws on each of the Eastern European members of its empire. And
                    so it was really the belief that a Germany which was neutral would play games,
                    would try to play both sides of the street, and that, under those circumstances,
                    it was likely to end up with Soviet domination rather than real independence,
                    real neutrality. And so, I think Eisenhower, for example, had no interest
                    whatever in trying to have a neutralized Germany, because hbelieved it would be
                    a source of instability. So that notion was really rejected by the
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: We've got about another half an hour, and I'd like to open it up,
                    if the panelists are willing, to chances from the audience, let me say if you
                    have questions, please...</p>
                <p>BOWIE: Now, let me just tell you so you won't be misled that after you ask the
                    question, I will not have understood it because of all the echoes, and
                    Livingston's going to translate for me.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Right, and there are certain subjects that Bob can't address
                    because he just simply wasn't there, for the time of the airlift, for example.
                    So, please stand up, and, we have a microphone, don't we? And put your question
                    directly to Bob and move forward if you want to, Peter, and make it as clear as
                    you can.</p>
                <p>Peter Quint: My name's Peter Quint, and I'd like to go back to McCloy and ask
                    about the release of convicted war criminals by McCloy and ask to what extent
                    was this a decision of his, and to what extent was this a decision that came
                    from the higher echelons of the government? And, what did he...was this an
                    agonizing, a difficult decision for him, or was it something that he thought was
                    clearly correct?</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: [repeating for Bowie]: The question of the war criminals—what was
                    McCloy's attitude toward that. Was it his decision, the decisions to release,
                    pardon the war criminals, [did it] come from higher echelons of the government?
                    Was it hard for him to do this? [To Quint] You didn't ask this but, [To Bowie]:
                    What sort of pressures was he under to bring about these pardons? [To audience]:
                    Bob was intimately involved in this.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, he inherited this from Clay. Clay had said he would like to deal
                    with it, but he never got around to finishing it off. And so there were
                    something like a hundred of these people of various sorts who had been convicted
                    with sentences of all sorts, high, up and down: ten years on one end and death
                    penalty on the other. And McCloy, as the military governor, had to deal with
                    these. The pressures from the Germans to mitigate or deal with these in various
                    ways were just horrendous. It was unbelievable! The churches urged that there be
                    clemency or that the sentences be changed, particularly with respect to the
                    death penalties, which were I think about a dozen or so, and they cited the fact
                    that the Basic Law which they had adopted outlawed death penalties. And, as I
                    say, many of the high church people were pressing very hard and some of Germans,
                    particularly military types, tried to create the impression that he should
                    mitigate these sentences if he expected Germany to contribute to defense.
                    Acheson, essentially, I think, took the view that it was entirely up to McCloy.
                    There was no instruction, as far as I know, from headquarters to McCloy. And
                    McCloy told Acheson that he wanted to have an independent committee that would
                    advise him on what to do with respect to these various sentences. And he got a
                    committee of three people, I think it was three. One of them was a distinguished
                    New York judge named Peck. The second one was a man, a New Yorker, who was in
                    charge of paroles and modifying sentences in the New York system. And the third
                    person was a man named Snow who had been and still was, I think, a legal advisor
                    in the State Department. So these three people were convened to review all the
                    sentences and to give their advice to McCloy. They studied these records. They
                    were not supposed to go back over the testimony, but they were supposed to
                    consider all the other aspects of the sentences. One of them did a study during
                    the summer, and the three of them got together for about six weeks and went over
                    all the records and came up with a report.</p>
                <p>The report recommended that many of the sentences be modified. With respect to
                    the death penalties, I think it was something like a half of them which they
                    thought should be reduced to life sentences, and then with respect to the lesser
                    sentences, they proposed a very large number be reduced somewhat. The principle
                    reason for many of these was the disparity among the different sentences for
                    similar offenses that had been heard by different judges, and second, that there
                    was a general tendency for the sentences given in the early stages to be more
                    severe than those given in the later cases. So they tried, I think, to more or
                    less equalize them. And in the case of a number of the death penalties, they
                    decided that it was excessive, in view of the facts found by the court on which
                    the sentence was based.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>After McCloy had had a chance to study the report and talk to the committee, he
                    did reduce a number of the sentences in accordance with their proposals. And
                    also changed, I guess, about half or a significant part of the death penalties.
                    One of the sentences which was changed, which later caused a lot of press
                    coverage and protests, was about Krupp. Krupp was the son. The father had been
                    indicted, but it was found that he was not capable of having a trial. He was ill
                    or something. So they simply took his son who had had a relatively minor
                    position in the Krupp enterprise—I think he was a member of the Board of
                    Directors or something like that. Most of these cases had involved slave labor;
                    that was the charge. And, anyway, McCloy apparently was somewhat affected by the
                    idea that they had simply substituted the son because they couldn't get the
                    father. So I think that was one case where it was influenced by that condition.
                    But otherwise, he'd largely followed the advice of the committee.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Your advice. You advised on this too, did you not?</p>
                <p>BOWIE: I didn't advise him on the individual cases. I reviewed the Board Report,
                    and I gave him my general impression that they had been somewhat lenient. But I
                    think he felt the board had been conscientious, they were men of integrity, and
                    that they had done their best. The later charges that he made his decisions to
                    placate the Germans, in the sense that they were not based on the merits, I
                    think is absolutely false. I think he really did his very level best as a lawyer
                    to do what he felt was just or fair in light of all the circumstances.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Any more questions from the floor, please, would you take a
                    microphone and get as close to Bob as you can.</p>
                <p>Speaker: Mr. Bowie, this is about Clay and the currency reform. Did Clay have to
                    battle tooth and nail with Washington to get the authority to execute the
                    currency reform, or did he have to simply outfox Washington in the way that you
                    described earlier today?</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: [repeating for Bowie]: The currency reform, which is, of course,
                    after your time. Did Clay have difficulties with Washington on trying to get the
                    currency reform put through? Did he have to outfox Washington in order to get it
                    put through? This was the currency reform of 1948.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: I just honestly don't know. I can't remember a thing about that. This was,
                    I think, after you had the merger of the three zones for the purpose of
                    administration, and they decided that it would be necessary and desirable to
                    have a currency reform. I think the initiative for some of these things came
                    from Erhard, and I simply don't remember a thing about whether or not Washington
                    intervened. He did, I think, have various arguments from time to time about
                    economic policy, which the State Department argued for, and he had a different
                    policy. And I think there was a feeling on the part of the State Department that
                    he was kind of difficult to deal with. But, I can't answer your question.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Do we have anything more from the floor? At all? I have a couple of
                    questions, but, Paul and Richard? We've got about fifteen minutes left. (Pause).
                    Well, I wanted to ask you to talk a little about something we talked about in
                    the car coming down, Bob, which I think is perhaps not given sufficient
                    attention. And that is, in this period of the transition from the Allied Control
                    Council to the bizonal and trizonal, the obstacles that the French put up. I
                    remember you were saying the other day on the phone that in some regards, the
                    French were more difficult in the early years than even the Soviets were, in
                    terms of four-power administration. Could you say a little bit about that?</p>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, I don't know that I'd say that they were more difficult than the
                    Soviets, but the French had lively memories of the German occupation, and they
                    had more historic memories of other fights with the Germans. And so they were
                    inclined to resist anything which had a tendency to build up the power of
                    Germany even in a small way. And so, in the very early stages in particular,
                    when the Control Council began to meet and tried to keep Germany as a whole and
                    tried to enact certain provisions that had the effect of reviving the power or
                    strength of Germany, even in a mild way, they tended to take the initiative in
                    opposing the decisions by the Control Council. It was pretty clear that the
                    Soviets were letting them carry the onus of being the bad boy because as long as
                    the French were blocking it, the Soviets didn't need to. But sooner or later, it
                    became clear that they were at least as strong in opposing many of these actions
                    as were the Soviets. I should say at the very beginning, Clay considered that
                    one of his implicit instructions was to try to see if they couldn't continue the
                    cooperation which they had had more or less during the war with the Soviets. In
                    other words, there was a real effort to try to have friendly or cooperative
                    relations with the Soviets. And, in fact, this was actually successful in a
                    certain mild, human way in the first year or two. I remember, for example, in
                    the first New Year's, we had a four-power ball, and each country provided part
                    of the entertainment. We had some kind of a jazz contribution, and I think the
                    French had a well-known chanteuse. The Russians, I think, had a Russian chorus.
                    But, in any event, Bill Draper, who was the economic man for Clay, took the
                    little group of four and took me along because I was living with him to the
                    rest-and-relaxation facilities that the army had acquired in the Riviera. And so
                    we spent a weekend in the Riviera. And on the way back home, the French
                    representative had us stop in Paris, and he took us to a show at one of the
                    caf�...places, and the older Russian, who was rather puritanical, was horrified
                    at the displays, the nudity. The young man who was his assistant obviously had a
                    somewhat different reaction. (laughter) But what I'm trying to illustrate is
                    that we were really making an effort to have a nice relation with the Russians,
                    it was more or less reciprocal. Because many of these people had been recruited
                    for some of these posts from academic or other places, that is, they were not
                    strictly party types. But after about two or three years, it began to be clear
                    that the Soviets were not going to be cooperative. But it took the French some
                    years before they began to recognize the desirability of trying to seek
                    reconciliation, before they were willing, for example, to join in on the
                    tripartite arrangements, to try to treat Germany, as provided in the Potsdam
                    protocol, as a unit in order to make it possible for recovery. But even so, they
                    were sensitive about the rearming of Germany. That was quite a different
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Q-Livingston: I've got one more thing I'd like to ask before we break unless
                    either of you do [to Steege and Immerman] and that is to describe—which is well
                    described in the book that you and Richard Immerman wrote together—the Solarium
                    exercise. What that was, you know, and what brought it on, and what was the
                    outcome.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, it started with a meeting that was held by Eisenhower very shortly
                    after he took office, and the meeting included people like Alan Dulles, and
                    somebody from the Defense Department, and Eisenhower himself, and Humphrey from
                    Treasury. Anyway, they were talking generally about what the situation was
                    vis-�-vis the Russians. And Dulles expressed some rather pessimistic views—more
                    or less that the Russians were doing better than we were in terms of how they
                    were conducting their policy, and simply raised the question about whether or
                    not we were having the right stance with respect to the Russians. So, Eisenhower
                    said, Well, why don't we have a real exploration of this? And he said, I think
                    we ought to have three small groups composed of qualified people from the CIA,
                    the Defense and State Departments, I mean, diplomats, or people who knew about
                    diplomacy, policy-making, and ask each of them to take a particular policy
                    possibility. There will be three of them: there will be continuation of
                    containment; drawing the line, as it was described, in which you said to the
                    Soviets, if you use any method of getting beyond your present area, you're going
                    to have a fight. We'll resist it very strongly; and finally, rollback. And each
                    of the three groups was given about six weeks to make a study, and they were
                    told to make the best case they could for this point of view, this policy, in
                    each case. And then, they did this, each of them made a written report, but then
                    they had a meeting in the White House for almost a whole day, in which they made
                    their presentations, and they were supposed to explain what it was that you
                    would do, what would be the risks and costs, what would be the likelihood of
                    success, and so on, and particularly, the risk of war. And, so each of them made
                    their written report, and then each of them made their oral presentation. And
                    you had the people from the Planning Board, the members of the NSC itself, and
                    Eisenhower, and the Cabinet. And, at the end, Eisenhower gave about a 45-minute
                    reaction or summary of his impression of the whole thing. And amazingly, Kennan
                    once said essentially that Eisenhower showed his intellectual ascendancy over
                    any man in the room, and everybody was astounded; that included himself.
                    (laughter)</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Anyway, the Solarium Exercise was treated only as an input to making the
                    strategy. Eisenhower asked the NSC adviser Cutler to put together with the help
                    of the members of the groups the gist of what had been said and to give it to
                    the Planning Board to use as one input in preparing the first NSC strategy
                    paper. And this caused a little problem because when Cutler put it together, he
                    framed it as a directive, and the Planning Board took the view that he was not
                    supposed to be a policy-maker, and that it was not appropriate for him to be
                    trying to dictate or suggest that this was an instruction. In fact, anticipating
                    this, Dulles wrote me a little note saying, We did not intend what was prepared
                    by Cutler to be an instruction. It was only intended to be an input. I expect
                    you and the other members of the Planning Board to give us your judgment of what
                    you feel should be the right policy. Anyway, it was only treated as an input.
                    But Eisenhower himself told Goodpasture, who he put on the rollback panel, that
                    he was putting him on because he wanted to be sure that somebody had good sense.
                    (laughter)</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Do we have any other questions at all here in the audience? Well,
                    thank you all very much. Thank you, Paul; thank you, Richard; thank you, Stu;
                    and thank you, Bob, most of all, for answering all the questions that you said
                    you couldn't answer! Including many more. (laughter) Philipp, we're about to
                    break up, but if you have any other questions?</p>
                <p>Q-Gassert: Did anyone ask the Berlin Airlift question? How did it impact the
                    political scene in this country?</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: He wants to ask you about the Berlin Airlift. How did it impact the
                    political scene in this country? You were back here then.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: Well, the way in which the Berliners endured this and stuck with it I
                    think impressed the public back here. It was a plus from the point of view of
                    sympathy for the Berliners. The public was outraged by the blockading the food
                    and all the rest. And there was considerable pride in the fact that the airlift
                    had outdone the Soviets, and I think a considerable amount spilled over into
                    admiration for the way in which the Germans had lived through it and helped with
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q-Gassert: So, it really changed the image of Germany, I guess.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: This was one of the things also that enormously impressed Clay with
                    respect to Reuter because when he was starting this, it wasn't altogether clear
                    just how well it was going to work, or how much he was going to be able to ship.
                    They were able to ship much more than they had expected, especially after he got
                    the larger planes. I think Clay had said to Reuter, Do you think the people of
                    Berlin will be able to manage this if we try, and he assured him absolutely that
                    they would, and Reuter's leadership apparently was very important in making sure
                    that the people stood staunchly with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Paul, do you want to ask, it was your period for your book—does
                    that fit more or less with your impression?</p>
                <p>Q-Steege: Well, I think that the relationship between Reuter and Clay is really
                    important, but I think the thing that I would underscore is the ways in which
                    Berliners played an absolutely vital role in sustaining themselves, and that the
                    airlift never brought in all that people needed to survive. One of the
                    interesting things is the ways in which the blockade was never total and the
                    airlift was never total, and that Berliners played a very important role in
                    shaping how that event operated. But I think the ways in which Clay and Reuter
                    were very astute at creating impressions about what was going on and also of
                    elaborating the solidarity were absolutely central to that moment.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Well, that's where your Alltagsgeschichte really does play a role.
                    And I think the other factor about Berlin, of course, was—and that was true
                    right to the end—it attracted the media, even though, for all sorts of reasons,
                    and I mean, the best American reporters were in Berlin during the time—Maggie
                    Higgins and all these people, reporting extensively, and that made a
                    difference.</p>
                <p>BOWIE: And, you know, it was a real success. And it was a sort of achievement by
                    technological means and peaceful means—it made a good impression.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Well, let me thank you again for all your participation, and I
                    guess we have little something in the other room, right?</p>
                <p>Q-Gassert: Yes, we would like to invite you over to the next room. We have a
                    lunch there, so please stay here and continue our discussions over lunch.</p>
                <p>Q-Livingston: Thank you.</p>
                <p>Q-Gassert: Thanks again.</p>
