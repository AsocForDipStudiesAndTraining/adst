                <p>LISA MANFULL HARPER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Kristie Miller</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 19, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Kristie Miller. I am interviewing Lisa Manfull
                        Harper on April 19, 1990, at my home in McLean, Virginia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Lisa, your father, Melvin Manfull, was in the Foreign Service. He went in in
                    1954?</p>
                <p>HARPER: I think he entered in the late 1940s, after the War. He was sent to Paris
                    after the Palous Rose Conference of 1952. He came home one day in Washington,
                    told us we were going to Paris; and this is where my career as a Foreign Service
                    daughter began. I was six. We took one of the old PanAm Clippers, I think they
                    were called Constellations, with sleeping berths. From the day we arrived in
                    Paris my parents determined that we were going to be little French kids.</p>
                <p>This was something that caused us some problems later on, because English wasn't
                    really part of our daily activity.We settled into an elegant apartment in the
                    l6th arrondissement, on Avenue Victor Hugo. My mother hired a former French
                    actress, Mme. Fournez-Gafour, to give us French pronunciation lessons. So we
                    started going to the park with Mme. Fournez learning French. A few weeks later,
                    school began and after consulting with friends my parents put me into l'Institut
                    Marie Auxiliatrice, a French convent school. I was the only foreigner and as a
                    matter of fact the only non-Catholic.</p>
                <p>I was also not quite a French-speaker then and it was very difficult. The
                    children were not kind to me. My parents would just say, “Oh, it's okay, it's
                    okay,” and then I would say, “Oh, they call me a little snot-nose.” And my
                    mother would say, “Oh, you must have misunderstood.” (she laughs) In any case,
                    the French teachers just had no idea how to take care of me. I just had to try
                    to cope with them. They said the only other foreigner was Chinese but she had
                    spoken French. So I just sat in the back of the room and had our afternoons with
                    Mme. Fournez until I learned French. Then I decided that I would beat them at
                    their own game. In French schools, if you do well, if you're the first in the
                    class, you're decorated like Napol�on (she laughs). So I made sure I got one of
                    three decorations. If you scored on everything, then you got to wear something
                    that looked like the Legion of Honor, with a great big red band. We were really
                    isolated from the American community. My parents met a lot of French friends and
                    just decided that they were going to immerse themselves in French culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they make such a decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know. (she laughs) But my brother didn't like it, and after one
                    year with the Jesuits he said he was an American and he wanted to go to the
                    American School. But I stuck it out and spent three years at the Catholic
                    convent school. After that — I was so tired, there was three or four hours of
                    homework every night and too much pressure, that I put on myself, really, to be
                    Number One and to beat the little French kids at their own game — my parents put
                    us into La Petite Ecole Nouvelle, which was an experimental school at Saint
                    Cloud. It was supposed to be an American model but it really wasn't: we spent
                    one hour playing in the woods every day, and we had art and music classes, and
                    we really never did much work. After our two years there my parents finally
                    realized that things were not going well — I mean, we were having a great time —
                    so then upon consultation again with their French friends, they put me in the
                    Couvent des Oiseaux, which was the most prestigious French convent school. At
                    that school they decided that I would have to take remedial English lessons.
                    (both laugh uproariously) I thought my English was pretty good but they felt
                    that I had a terrible accent, you know, because it wasn't British. Anyway, I
                    went to that school until my parents were transferred back to the States. We
                    stayed six years in Paris. My father was told that for his career “finally,
                    you're going to have to leave.” He was working with USRO, which was the
                    implementation of the Marshall Plan, working out of the Hotel Talleyrand. As my
                    brother and I think back over those six years, we really never saw my father. We
                    had this image of — my parents were these wonderful people that got dressed up
                    at night, went off to cocktail parties, or they had their cocktail parties, and
                    our role was really to be perfect little kids. We were told to come in, and I
                    would show off my French, and maybe sometimes we would get to show people where
                    the bathroom was. I remember getting into trouble once because I got tired of
                    this and put up signs all over the apartment saying “W.C. this way.” (hearty
                    laughs) We were always on show. We weren't allowed to do the things that kids
                    would do. I remember also once I was racing my bicycle, I fell down, the pedal
                    went into my leg, and my mother saying, “You're an American, show these French
                    people that you don't cry, that you're strong, that you're brave.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What an immense amount of pressure!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HARPER: A lot of pressure to be perfect all the time. You were on show, you were
                    representing, you were living completely away from your own culture. I really
                    can't remember one occasion where we sort of connected with other Americans, you
                    know. Little French girls were “my crowd.” You really never had just a
                    spontaneous experience. If you wanted to invite your little French friends to
                    come and play with you, your mother wrote a note to her mother. You couldn't
                    play, there was no place to play because we lived in Paris. Sometimes I was just
                    lonely and I'd go downstairs and I'd jump on my Pogo stick. And then people
                    would come up to me, “French don't know Pogo sticks” and they'd come around and
                    they'd talk to me. So I became a great reader. I had an arrangement with a local
                    bookstore, there being no public library nearby, and I would just read books and
                    trade them in. You know, I'm very glad that I learned to speak native French
                    this way, it was a wonderful experience to be totally immersed in a foreign
                    culture, but it made for a very difficult time when I came back to the States,
                    because I really didn't know who I was: was I a little French girl or was I an
                    American?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of problems did you encounter? You were twelve
                        when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. My parents were — my father was going to be working for the
                    Secretariat. He took a few months off to buy a house and restore it and paint
                    it. We were off to Gonzales, Texas, population 6,000, to live with my
                    grandmother, my mother's mother, who was a very conservative Southern lady with
                    very different values from us; you know, not recently enlightened at all. We
                    arrived there, we were little French kids. My brother had on his little Navy
                    blue outfit and I had on my little gray suit and my little hat, and I remember
                    on arriving making sure that my brother had his gloves on before he met my
                    grandmother— (laughing)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Gonzales, Texas! Oooooh, boy... Did you have as hard a
                        time there as you'd had in the French school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Very hard time. Well, actually, it was funny because the school system
                    put me into an English class for Mexicans. That was fine with me because
                    culturally I understood these people. These were Catholics, and even though I
                    was Episcopalian I'd been to Catholic schools. These were people that had really
                    the same sort of approach to life that I had. Much more fun-loving and open and
                    free than the Presbyterian kind of background that my grandmother came from. But
                    then my grandmother was upset that we were in this — it was somehow loss of face
                    for her for me to be in this class. We just felt disconnected. I also found at
                    age 12 my cousins were little women, you know — at that age they were out
                    dating, they were dressed up in very tight toreador pants, I remember, and I
                    still had my little French convent outfit and I was still very much a little
                    girl.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We stayed there for it seems like three or four months, and this was really a
                    breakthrough. I found too that the young people there who seemed to catch on to
                    what we were experiencing was the pastor of the church — the pastor seemed to
                    figure out that things were not going well. My grandmother never did, she was
                    just embarrassed, we were like creatures from outer space, we just didn't
                    conform to what she wanted her grandchildren to be like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother wasn't there —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No. My parents were fixing up this house in Washington. Also at that
                    point they weren't even willing to deal with it, and I think there was really
                    very little recognition at that point of what it was to have had this uprooting
                    and other background. Now, I understand, there are classes and support groups
                    and all kinds of things for Foreign Service children who come back and are just
                    completely out of phase. But in those days there wasn't. I must say, thinking
                    back over my father, when we got back it was the same thing: we just never saw
                    him. My mother was the one who raised us. She got pregnant at age 40, so that
                    was another burden in our coming back to Washington. So we were really sort of
                    adrift, and you felt in that atmosphere that you really couldn't talk about your
                    problems of maybe adjusting or trying to figure out who were you and — I can
                    remember thinking at that age “what American traits do I want to keep and what
                    French traits do I want to keep.” And I'd find that just even in terms of taste
                    preferences it had all been molded by the French. I liked different things and
                    different occupations. There was also a surface sophistication that I had — it
                    didn't go very deep but it was there, and so it kept me sort of out of step with
                    my own group in school. And then I skipped two grades. That kind of helped, in a
                    way —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because then at least you were with people who were as
                        sophisticated as you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, but also my parents decided to put me in public school, so I went to
                    Woodrow Wilson High School. There were very few people — my best friend there
                    was a girl from India, because there was somebody I could relate to. And there
                    was a great desire on the one hand to conform, to be an all-American kid, but I
                    couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you probably didn't want to give up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Didn't want to give up, because I thought that, you know, that I was me,
                    but that if I had wanted to become one of the crowd, I would have had to give up
                    some of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel lonely?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, yes... But, puzzle, puzzle, “Why isn't this working? Why can't I
                    make friends? Why don't I have dates like everybody else?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably scared them to death. (both laugh heartily)
                        So you would find yourself drawn to somebody like the Indian girl, who was
                        having the same problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. And another thing, too, that I missed in this Foreign Service life
                    is that I wasn't connected to a family. It's not just the Gonzales family. My
                    father's family came from Utah and when we'd go visit them we would just go and
                    meet these apparitions for a few days and we really never knew them. There was
                    just this great hunger to have a network of friends and family around. We were
                    lucky to stay six years in Paris but you were still uprooted from your friends,
                    and I found that my French friends that I continued to write with didn't
                    understand me after a point, because I started writing like an American teenager
                    and they were really just out of phase. So then those friendships sort of
                    dwindled away because we were going in different directions. I had a chance to
                    continue in French schools, my parents gave me that option but I did make the
                    conscious decision that I was an American, that I needed to learn to speak and
                    read and write English. The speaking came very easily because obviously we'd
                    spoken English at home, but the writing was something else. One of the things
                    that I really appreciated with my father, once he realized there was a problem,
                    is that I would dictate to him my essays and tell him in French what I wanted to
                    say, and then he would help me translate them into English. He was very good
                    about that — when he was home, but he had a series of high-pressure jobs. He was
                    working 17 or 18 hours a day, so he was just making cameo appearances. Q: I
                    think that's probably a very difficult feature of Foreign Service life for a lot
                    of children — not only their fathers but when they're overseas their mothers are
                    away at social functions that are seen to be necessary.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. My mother was always very active in Paris. She was an active
                    volunteer, a very good organizer, a very good entertainer, and I certainly
                    learned a lot from that. Her focus, at least in Paris, was in helping my
                    father's career. Plus, we had nannies every day, we had a maid, so she really
                    didn't have to worry so much about that. Actually one of the benefits of
                    Washington for us was that she was there every afternoon when we came home. It
                    was hard on her not to have a maid and the nannie(she laughs heartily) but at
                    least she was there to talk to. I think really we started to get to know her, as
                    children, there. My father we didn't get to know until much later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the advantages to you of being a Foreign Service
                        child?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I think getting to know other cultures, handling yourself in social
                    situations, once you learn one language there's a facility, you're not afraid
                    you're going to be able to learn other languages. In Paris even though I have a
                    hard time, I always considered myself a very privileged little girl. I can
                    remember my seventh birthday: my Foreign Service friends brought over a cake in
                    the shape of a hat, and a little bottle of champagne. And I thought, “Wow, I'm a
                    lucky little girl.” (then laughing heartily) “American little girls don't get
                    bottles of champagne!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you felt you were lucky for living in France.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you had to face so many challenges at such an
                        early age, and because you faced them successfully, do you think that gave
                        you a very high self-esteem? It certainly should have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know. It probably —</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, did you always see yourself as a person who could
                        do what she wanted to set out to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I never thought of it that way. What I thought of was that if I were
                    going to succeed, I would have to fight. That was sort of my conclusion. “You're
                    really going to have to struggle and fight and work extremely hard to achieve
                    something.” Because that had been the history of Paris. It does give you a
                    self-confidence that you know that wherever they drop you in the world you're
                    going to be able to manage, you're going to be able to make friends, you're
                    going to reach out for friends wherever you are because they're necessary to
                    you. I think that on the whole the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The
                    disadvantages being, I think, that you are robbed of a normal American
                    childhood. I feel now that unless you come home for those crucial high school
                    years, you may always be out of phase with your own society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think that saved you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, it really did help me. I still find even today in department stores
                    and supermarkets, people will say, “You're French.” I've never lost that, and
                    it's not that I've consciously tried to keep it but there's something about the
                    way I look and talk and act that people who know us and look for us pick up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I met you in college you had just come back from a
                        summer job working as a translator for the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: This was one of those sweetheart deals that my father worked out. At that
                    point I was bilingual in French, and I had very good Spanish, so my father had
                    talked to a friend in Language Services and said, “Here's my daughter, would you
                    like to hire her for the summer?”Well, I was hired, and at first I started
                    translating documents. Then they realized I could do more. I was 16 years old so
                    I was a little under-age for this. Then two of the interpreters said, “We'll
                    train you as a simultaneous interpreter.” So when they had free time they'd take
                    me into the booth and I would train. I flunked the Spanish part because I just
                    wasn't “native” enough, but I passed the French part and they said, “Why don't
                    you go along as a foreign interpreter?” At that point the Administrative woman
                    hit the roof. “My God, she's only 16, what's going to happen? We can't send
                    somebody, we can't even pay somebody that age.” Then some people went to bat for
                    me and I went along as the third person on the team. Andy Steigman, who later
                    became an ambassador, was the head of the team. Then we had a wonderful old
                    interpreter named Klugman or something like that, who spoke ten languages. And
                    then a group of Senegalese and some other West African students.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>This was a marvelous time. Some of them were avowed Marxists who were trying to
                    find a reason to leave the group after San Francisco, so they would try to get
                    discriminated against in airports. And they'd be told, “Sorry, you can't be
                    discriminated against. An airport is a federal property. There are laws against
                    it — “ This was in 1962. So a bunch of them finally got kicked out of an
                    American Indian bar in Phoenix, so they left the group. (laughter) The Indians
                    didn't want me, either, but that didn't seem to bother them. This was a good
                    experience. It also taught me that while I liked speaking French, I didn't like
                    being an interpreter. You know, you felt like a machine, you were just sort of
                    being “used,” and I realized that 12-hour days were a normal part of it, you
                    were just expected to keep on translating. Also part of that job was you were
                    sort of nursemaid, you were just watching out for them and making sure that
                    everything went well— it was just not what I was looking for. I was offered a
                    job by Language Services, they were very eager to have me. As a matter of fact,
                    I also had been studying Russian and they said if I could get my Russian up, and
                    if I had French, Spanish and Russian, I could have come on as a GS-13.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At age 16?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Whenever. They were willing to take me on. It was a good year, and I
                    don't think that anybody ever knew how old I was, either. I had to be very
                    careful in bars, because they did “card” people and I was certainly under
                    drinking age. And I had to watch out just that people wouldn't ask me about life
                    experiences, because then too they would have realized. Strangely enough, years
                    later in Senegal I met one of my students. I was trying to find our
                    administrative officer's house way out on the beach in Dakar and I went into the
                    wrong house. And here was this woman, bless her soul, who had been one of my
                    students and she instantly recognized me, and she said, “Lisa!” and I said,
                    “Vas-tu!” It was a total accident, what happened. That's another — one of the
                    nice things about the Foreign Service, you do meet people again, you're moving
                    around enough so that if you wait long enough, you're going to find them. (both
                    laugh)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you got to college, and you won the Spanish prize your
                        freshman year, and you majored in Mandarin Chinese. At what point did you
                        think about joining the Foreign Service for yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I really hadn't considered any other career. I didn't want to enter
                    graduate school. I knew I wanted Federal Service. I found that my professors
                    were very much against that. As a matter of fact, some of them felt that I
                    wasted their time, not mine, not continuing on to graduate school. So there was
                    tremendous pressure —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jimmy Wren?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HARPER: Not so much Jimmy Wren as the people — Jimmy Wren, this was one of my
                    favorite professors, had set me up for a scholarship in graduate school at Yale,
                    in Comparative Literature; this was another sweetheart deal, I could have walked
                    right into it. I found that the professors at Yale really didn't like the idea
                    that I was seeking government service. “Waste of time, why should we train you.”
                    And then when I turned it down, my other professors at Brown were very
                    disappointed. Because I'd turned it down, because I wasn't choosing
                    academia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although, given the fact that while we were at Brown, I
                        for one never had a female professor, academia was not an attractive career
                        in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Right. And then when I thought of the prospects of being a Chinese
                    scholar, it just wasn't “active” enough. You know, people are important for me,
                    and even though I enjoyed Chinese and I still love the language, it just wasn't
                    what I wanted. So what happened was I graduated from college and had gotten the
                    whole process started and was waiting for word as to whether I'd passed or not
                    and would be admitted or not, I went off to Brussels where my father was DCM. At
                    that point, one of the typical experiences: I arrived there, and the
                    ambassador's wife, who was French, looked at me and said, “Ah, you're just the
                    person we need. We need an American girl to make her debut.” (laughter)</p>
                <p>Here I was, I was 21 or 22, I had graduated from college, and being a debutante
                    really wasn't on my list of priorities. I was really in Brussels waiting to join
                    the Foreign Service. I thought this was as good a place as any to wait, and I
                    had signed up for Chinese at the local university and found a wonderful
                    professor there, also started Japanese classes because I'd always wanted to try
                    that. I had a life arranged, and here was this lady — so I went to my parents
                    and said, “Look here, I really don't need to do this, do I.” And they said, “Oh,
                    yes, we really need you, we don't have any other girl in the community who can
                    do this, you must do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they want an American debutante anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Because they had an international debutantes' ball —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! And you were going to be the representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I was going to be the representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Miss America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HARPER: Right. So I put on my white dress, and I selected this very nice young
                    man from the embassy, and they said, oh, no, he wasn't good enough, so they
                    found me another man who — I don't know, probably looked better in a tuxedo. We
                    were off and I was the debutante. And this is one of those Foreign Service
                    things. The ambassador's wife was very French, very strong sense of what people
                    should and shouldn't do, and she was the head of the embassy as far as she was
                    concerned in the social things. To the point where she would call up my mother
                    and me and tell us what to wear. “I am wearing a short skirt today and I am
                    wearing my short Givenchy and I certainly don't want you to wear your shor[name
                    of French designer] or your long —” Not that we had her kind of designer
                    clothes, but anyway she was the kind of woman who said, “You will show up for
                    bridge at my house at a certain time.” This was 1968, I think.</p>
                <p>So, in any case, I became a debutante. As a matter of fact, I was on in Belgian
                    movie houses because as it turned out I was the only one smart enough to learn
                    the choreography of this event, which required walking up and down steps,
                    curtseying, turning, waltzing —(she breaks up laughing). So I have a newsreel of
                    me, my 15 minutes of Andy Warhol fame. There I was on TV screens throughout
                    Belgium, Le Bal des D�butantes. I found the girls were very shallow, these
                    Belgian girls really didn't have any professional aspirations, I had nothing in
                    common with them. I was doing my duty, as my parents and as our ambassador felt
                    that I should do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was the way it was done in those days. If you didn't
                        do it you jeopardized your father's or your husband's career, that's
                        right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: There was no question. I would have had a very difficult time not doing
                    it. So I did it. I also had a job in the admin section. It was a time when NATO
                    was moving from Paris to Brussels. Another assumption was that certainly I would
                    work in the embassy. I mean, everybody'thrilled to — and so I worked, I
                    decorated apartments and made sure apartments had the right number of lamps and
                    furniture, and put up terrible fiberglass curtains. That was my summer after
                    graduation from college. That was 1967. I came back in '68. I joined the Foreign
                    Service in February '68. At that point I was told, “Oh, you speak wonderful
                    languages. We need people to learn Vietnamese.” So I went to FSI to learn
                    Vietnamese. I wasn't thrilled about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't you been in Vietnam visiting your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. I'd had two really incredible summers in Vietnam, and these are some
                    of the high points of my life, really. My dad was political counselor then. He
                    was a friend of Fritz Nolting, a very close friend. Nolting was the ambassador
                    who had supported Ngo Dinh Diem to the end, even after the policy was shifting.
                    My father came in with Ambassador Nolting and within three months the whole
                    situation in Vietnam had changed. Diem was overthrown and killed, then we had a
                    series of military coups and short lived governments. My father inherited a
                    Political section of people whom he'd been told were sort of retreads and
                    problem cases and they turned out to be absolutely outstanding officers. It was
                    fun, too, to have met them when they were junior officers, and now all these
                    people have gone on to be ambassadors. Really an extraordinary group of
                    people.</p>
                <p>We lived at 6C Tu Kuong in a wonderful old French compound with high walls and
                    floors made of wonderful old tiles. We had the only swimming pool in the
                    compound. There, again, it was a round of very interesting parties. In Saigon in
                    those days you still had a lot of French influence, you had soldiers of fortune,
                    you had the American press making its name — Neil Sheehan, David Halberstam —
                    all these people would call my father at two or three in the morning asking for
                    information or confirmation, whatever they were looking for. They would drop by
                    the house.There were a tremendous number of Vietnamese coming by the house. Some
                    of them turned out to be working for the Viet Cong all along. I always watch
                    Vietnam retrospectives on TV to see whom I know. (laughing) “Oh, yes, I remember
                    her!”</p>

                <p>HARPER: I can remember having a real fight with Joe Alsop about the Chams, they
                    being a Muslim minority. I also had some adventures. I remember once a friend of
                    mine had introduced me to a girl my age. I really hadn't thought much about her
                    — this was in my first summer there — and she said, “Come and join my family
                    iHue.” So I went down to Hue, which is the ancient capital of Vietnam in central
                    Vietnam. And I said, “Gee, these people live well.” There was a brother who was
                    an archbishop; the mother lived in a traditional Vietnamese house with marvelous
                    carved wooden beds, no mattresses. She presented me with a bowl I still have
                    which was “bleu de Hue,” a special blue and white porcelain made in Hue that's a
                    museum piece. We just had a marvelous weekend. A few months later I was looking
                    at pictures of the Diem family and realized that my hostess had been the sister
                    of the president. Nobody had told me this. What this girl and I had in common, I
                    think, was our age and also that we'd gone to different branches of the same
                    convent school. She also invited me to visit her uncle, Mr. Nguyen Van Bou. He
                    turned out to be the Saigon cinnamon king. He gave me lectures on how monopoly
                    was the only way to go, free-trade competition is no good. (she laughs) He was
                    immensely wealthy, so when he invited me and my friends, my pal really, to go up
                    to Cap San Jacques, which is the beach resort, he deployed his private army in
                    tanks along the road so that two young girls could not be threatened in any way.
                    So we were zooming along the road and here were these tanks advancing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, good grief.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We also got to go into parts of — my father was very upset, every time
                    he'd hear these adventures he was about ready to lock me up. He'd hear about
                    them afterwards!Then we got to Mr. Bou's villa and we found that he had two
                    matching villas, one for the east wind, one for the west wind, absolutely
                    identical down to the last jar and pot. Depending on the prevailing wind, we
                    would just shift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was religious, or — ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, just a whim of his. One would be cooler when the wind was blowing. In
                    any case, he was a fascinating character, really worth knowing. I also met a
                    Caodai General. At Brown I had written a paper on the Caodai, they were a
                    political religious sect, and they had their own private army too in those days.
                    They had an absolutely marvelous temple down in Tay Ninh Province where they had
                    all of their saints in life-size statues. Joan of Arc and Victor Hugo are two of
                    their saints. (laughter). I decided I really had to go and see this Caodai
                    temple. So I persuaded one of my father's junior officers to drive me to the
                    airport; this was loosely coordinated with my father. I convinced this Caodai
                    general that I was a world expert on Caodais. He had a thousand of his faithful
                    assemble for me to talk to. I had written my whole speech on the Caodai
                    religion. It's really a crazy syncretic religion that borrows from everybody,
                    with the army that gave them really political say in that particular
                    context.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was ready to go down, man came to pick me up. Unfortunately, on the way
                    to the airport, we realized that a coup was in process. He wouldn't drive me to
                    the airport, and I can remember being furious. As 17- or 18-year-old, who cares
                    if there's a coup going, I had a thousand Caodai waiting for me, (laughing) they
                    can't do this to me!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “My public!”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: My public is waiting. Anyway I guess he wondered what kind of an
                    evaluation he'd get from my fathe(even heartier laughing by both) if he turned
                    his daughter up in a little plane. I understand that the Caodai waited for three
                    hours and finally went home. I missed out on that.I got a summer job working for
                    the Social Welfare Group. It was an attempt to try to get the Buddhists and the
                    Catholics together and see if they couldn't work out a social welfare policy.
                    Unfortunately they hated each other and they wanted sort of an impartial person
                    to travel with them and they hit upon me. I'm also sure they had an eye to the
                    American embassy and pleasing them and also getting us involved in funding this
                    effort. So in any case the job was mine and we had a chance to travel all around
                    Vietnam to see what the Buddhists were doing, see what the Catholics were doing
                    with orphanages and other social welfare work. It was very primitive, and even
                    in those days there were some children who were either half-French or
                    half-Western and there were also some half-Black children —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, no, I think they were left over from the Senegalese soldiers who'd
                    served in Indochina. Anyway, they were always brought to us first, sort of “this
                    is your charge.” I felt very sorry for them because they had no chance in that
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was like Japan, they're very ethnocentric?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. So, I did that. And also managed to spend probably my only night in
                    a whore house. We got to Hue and they said, “Well, we're going to be staying in
                    a particular place that's no longer in business.” It was right next to the
                    Perfume River, a lovely location. Went up to the first floor, and even though I
                    was fairly innocent I looked in all these little cubicles and thought, “Hmmmm,
                    what is this?” Well, in any case there were no girls around and that was just a
                    place to spend the night. We went up to see the Domaine de Marie, which was a
                    very nicely run Catholic social welfare organization. It gave me a chance, too,
                    to see really how deep the religious conflicts were in Vietnam. Without somebody
                    in between, the Buddhists and the Catholics simply weren't talking. It's very
                    hard, actually, after a summer in Saigon, really an active, very stimulating
                    summer, to come back to Brown. I took a year off my third year. Really what I
                    needed to do was just to figure who I was and where I was going. It was probably
                    the best thing I ever did, because I was just coasting. I think one of the
                    things that a Foreign Service education does for you is that you can really put
                    a good face on everything. I mean, you're taught to do that, your parents are
                    too busy to really listen to your little problems, you always felt you're a
                    representative of your government, you really can't let down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you cover up your problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: You cover up your problems, you just cover them up —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you don't acknowledge them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No. Who are you going to talk to them about? There's nobody. I think if
                    there had been other children, if I had met other children with whom you'd have
                    the same experience, then it would have been a good idea just to talk it out.
                    But there was nobody else in my particular situation, or at least nobody that I
                    connected that I met.</p>
                <p>So I took a year off and — well, it started out that we were going to visit my
                    grandmother in Texas, a duty trip. My father had been sent to the UN to work on
                    the non-admission of China — this sounds funny these day[1990], but in 1965 we
                    were still trying to keep China out of the UN — and my father was told he'd be
                    living in a hotel and couldn't bring his family, and the per diem really wasn't
                    sufficient. We were in Gonzalez, Texas, and even my mother acknowledged that my
                    grandmother was very difficult. So at that point I hatched a scheme to get out
                    of Gonzalez and go down to Mexico and study Spanish.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I had a Brown classmate who was studying in Guadalajara and wasn't able to enter
                    her program but I enrolled at the University there. My mother decided to join me
                    — this hadn't bee(she laughs) part of the scheme but Gonzalez was getting to
                    her, too. So we arrived, and as luck would have it, somebody right there in the
                    line, “I know of a furnished apartment available for $70 a month, on Avenida
                    Vallarta, which is the very best avenue in Guadalajara.” And we moved in. My
                    youngest brother was with me but my other brother — the one who always said he
                    was an American and didn't want anything to do with foreign cultures — spent a
                    few more days with my grandmother, then hopped on a Greyhound bus and found us!
                    To this day I don't know how he found us at Guadalajara; we had just moved
                    in.</p>
                <p>In any case, we had six wonderful months there. It was the first time that we had
                    lived in a foreign country without the support of an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And without the demands —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, and without the obligations. People were wonderful to us. We had
                    some really marvelous encounters. You weren't “special” there, so you knew
                    people were being nice to you not because you could get them a visa or because
                    they had a message to transmit to the U.S. Government that would revolutionize
                    the world, but just because you were you. So these were six wonderful months,
                    and it was just what I needed, to kind of think through a lot of problems and
                    get a grip on myself. And also, at Pembroke, the women's part of Brown
                    University then, I never really sort of fit in and this period gave me the
                    chance to “I don't really care.” I gained the courage to say, “I'm just going to
                    be me and not worry about it.” Also it gave me a chance to work on Spanish.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>During the time we were there I got a job teaching French at a local school. I
                    returned to teaching later on, and enjoyed teaching and did well at it. Even
                    though the students, who were expatriates, weren't very serious; some of them
                    were smoking pot and would just fall out the window while I was teaching.
                    (laughing) I would look over and half the class was gone.Anyway, it gave me a
                    job and a purpose and I continued my studies. So it was six productive months.
                    My father would come down and visit us once in a while when he could manage to
                    get away from the UN. Then my father asked for the Imperial Defense College in
                    London, which is a senior British staff college. Then he said, “Well, you've
                    been out for six months, why don't you just stay out for six more months.” So we
                    all moved to London and had a wonderful year. I think that's the first time that
                    the family really came together and got to know one another. My father's workday
                    was very light. The IDC was a gentlemen's school — you know, you showed up,
                    pontificated until 3 or 4 p.m., had a glass of sherry and went home. We lived in
                    Chelsea on Old Church Street in a wonderful old town house, had a chance to
                    discover England and move around. We had a good year. The pressure was off
                    there, too. There were no embassy responsibilities for my dad, no deadlines to
                    meet, no ambassadors or staff to worry about. Then my father was sent to
                    Brussels, as DCM. And I returned to Brown for my last year and finished up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point you had decided you wanted to be in the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: You know when I think about it, I really hadn't considered any other job.
                    My two brothers, however, wouldn't have anything to do with this business, they
                    never considered government. For me it just felt like the right thing to do and
                    I thought it was what would take advantage of everything I'd learned. And I
                    guess, too, there was some patriotism involved. I'd had on the whole a pretty
                    privileged upbringing. I had learned a lot of things and in some way I should
                    give it back, put it back into the system. So I joined the Foreign Service. I
                    came to Washington and started studying Vietnamese. While studying Vietnamese I
                    met the man I married. It turned out he was to be posted to Brussels, where —
                    people then realized — his father-in-law was DCM! Then they decided to send him
                    to Copenhagen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: At first, it didn't. Obviously the Saigon assignment was “out.” In those
                    days, I found a tremendous sense of betrayal, the assumption that if you
                    married, you weren't serious about your career; that they spent all this time
                    selecting you, grooming you, training you, teaching you a language, and that you
                    were never going to —</p>

                <p>HARPER: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: My feeling was that the women were expected to “take the veil.” That if
                    you joined up, well, certainly not marriage; and not marriage too soon. I was
                    married in September 1968. Here, again, a Foreign Service story: my husband and
                    I had no money, we were just starting out, and my father insisted on a big
                    embassy wedding.My parents had this idea that if their only daughter was getting
                    married, it had to be a super-production. I had a husband (from whom I'm now
                    separated) who doesn't take well to these things, and it was an excruciating
                    experience for him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We had little crisis after little crisis, really I think it affected the
                    whole marriage. He arrived but didn't have the right kind of suit for the civil
                    ceremony in Brussels. My father said he would not sanction the wedding unless it
                    took place in Brussels, so we were married in Brussels. He also felt that it had
                    to be his kind of wedding. My parents just took over this wedding —</p>

                <p>HARPER: No, it isn't! At that point, my parents were living in an absolute
                    mansion, a wonderful house, and the reason they'd obtained it was that we had
                    three different ambassadors accredited to Belgium — one to the country, one to
                    NATO, and one to the EEC. One of them had taken the DCM's home. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>-something even more splendid. So all right, here it was, and it certainly made a
                    wonderful setting for a wedding. But it was September, my friends couldn't come,
                    people had either begun school again or work, so we ended up with very few of
                    our own friends there and 400 people that I never will see again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it became like a debutante party and an embassy
                        function.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HARPER: It was an embassy function, and it was a duty function. I realized that
                    people really didn't want to talk to me, this was just another nice embassy
                    function done perfectly: civil ceremony at the Hotel de Ville with marvelous
                    woman dressed in a tricornered hat officiating, then Melle van den Hoevel it
                    became an affair of state, a tour of the Hotel de Ville; we had a man in
                    knickers and a big silver mace (laughter) making noises with this mace as we
                    proceeded down the hall. In any case, David was horrified. My mother was upset
                    because David hadn't brought the right color suit and shoes for the civil
                    ceremony. If he'd been long in the Foreign Service he'd have known that a light
                    suit wouldn't do, but he hadn't been, and being a stubborn person he wouldn't
                    change. So this caused tremendous problems.</p>
                <p>In any case, we were married there and couldn't be posted to Brussels, which was
                    what he had prepared for. I think he was a bit resentful about this. Actually we
                    hadn't even considered that though maybe we should have. So he was assigned to
                    Copenhagen. I asked if there were a job there for me and was told there would be
                    no job at all. So I had to resign. This was very tough on me, because I had just
                    started my career.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Copenhagen, and being the daughter of a rather senior officer I'd
                    been used to being well treated and greeted. The couple sent to the airport to
                    meet us didn't even want to talk. They just dropped us off at the hotel that
                    looked over the back of a circus and you had these marvelous animal smells and
                    grunts and elephants and we stayed there for a month. Then I tried to get a job.
                    I didn't want to start a family, I was missing my career already, I was being
                    dragged into women's activities that I did not enjoy, and that's another thing:
                    there's tremendous pressure in a place like that. They assume that if you're
                    married but have no children, you're going to participate in all of these
                    volunteer activities or embassy functions and charities. That was no my priority
                    then. So I enrolled at the local university to study Chinese, and also got a job
                    working for a group that provided conference interpreters, guides, et cetera.
                    That lasted two weeks: the Danish Government found out about it and I was told
                    that I would have to resign, a Dane could do the job.</p>
                <p>I said, “Look here, I speak French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese, find me a Dane
                    who speaks those languages.” They couldn't but it was just a political thing.
                    The embassy did not help me. It's also interesting that I had to ask the
                    ambassador's permission even to accept that job, I had to write him a formal
                    letter; he could have refused my taking the job, eveprevented me from working at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's still true. I know that when I was teaching
                        foreign diplomats in Mozambique in the 80s — maybe it's just “sensitive”
                        ones but I had to get permission to teach the nationals of the Peoples
                        Republic of China.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HARPER: I thought, “this has nothing to do” — because I had resigned from the
                    Service. Then I was offered a job under the table working for an import-export
                    firm but decided I couldn't do it because of my husband's position, I just
                    couldn't afford to be caught. Then I began a battle with the embassy not really
                    helping all that much to get paid for the few weeks that I had worked for the
                    earlier company; everybody just said “oh you shouldn't have done it.” But I felt
                    that I was owed the money. Then there was a question of taxes; that was a big
                    problem in Copenhagen, what tax rate I paid. Finally six months later I was
                    compensated.</p>
                <p>Denmark in winter is very bleak. There were 15 hours of light — not sunlight,
                    just light — in January, February and March. And in my first year I was just
                    looking for something to get me out in the morning. I found that the
                    ambassador's social secretary was leaving and applied for that job. It was a
                    part-time local-hire job, working for the wife of an ambassador who was
                    political appointee. It was very tough for me, a professional woman, to be
                    watching out that she didn't wear the same dress twice, to work on her menus,
                    handle the servants, write her letters to celebrities and others, check on
                    somebody who was entitled to the title of Her Serene, Princess, whatever. I did
                    that for the two years that we were there together.</p>
                <p>In those days, too, there was a lot of entertainment and we didn't even question
                    that you would help your husband entertain. So cook, be a good hostess, make the
                    house look good so that when we had foreign visitors we'd really have a
                    representational situation. And I kept thinking, “Well, well, I'd really like to
                    be back in the Foreign Service.” The opportunity didn't present itself because
                    we went off to Bujumbura and there, again there was no job for me. I thought
                    well, I enjoy teaching, so with no benefit of any teaching degrees I applied for
                    a job at the local university teaching English, and was hired. I created my own
                    programs anreally had a good time. I taught an African history course, in
                    English; and English conversation, English as a foreign language. Then I got a
                    job with the UN training interpreters who were to be assigned to an economic
                    conference, French-English. I set up the program, taught them, had a wonderful
                    group of students, we were all ready for the conference and it got canceled!
                    (laughter) I always wondered what happened to my little interpreters.</p>
                <p>That too was an awkward tour, in a way, because I had an ambassador's wife who
                    felt that even though I was teaching — and I was teaching a lot, sometimes 16
                    hours a week, also writing my own programs, selecting my own materials — I
                    should be stuffing Christmas packages for the Foreign Service nationals'
                    children. We had a terrible confrontation at the German embassy, I remember,
                    when she started yelling at me because I wasn't “pulling my weight.” This was a
                    tremendous embarrassment for all concerned but I think it's a real problem. What
                    was operating there was that assumption that since I had no children and wasn't
                    really working —</p>

                        still expected, and if you don't do it you're resented, even though it no

                    to do something, which I resisted, because I felt that if you looked at my
                    contribution to the community, I was doing a lot with the Burundi students, I
                    was certainly teaching a lot about the U.S. just by my very presence. I used to
                    work a lot with our local USIA in getting my course materials, showing films on
                    the U.S.I did my work for U.S. interests in Burundi in other ways.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: As a matter of fact, (she laughs) I pretty much did — I was the one
                    ordering films for my students, and bringing them down, and just using those
                    resources, you know, for the next generation of leaders in that country. Well,
                    anyway, I was upset at her — just her assumption that I wasn't doing my job
                    unless I was — you know, you can find other people to stuff Christmas packages,
                    or to decorate trees, or to dress up as Santa Claus, whatever it was going to
                    be. Burundi was a marvelous tour for us in that it was the only Foreign Service
                    tour where we were friends of the president.It was my 30th birthday party. David
                    had huge stereo speakers which he set up — we were up on a hill facing the town,
                    and the sound was just reverberating all over. And what we didn't know was that
                    the president of the country had a little hideaway up in the hills just two
                    doors away from us.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>We woke him up, and all of a sudden the house was surrounded by troops — I saw
                    their shadows surrounding the house, my dog went crazy, and all of a sudden here
                    appeared the president, whose name was Michel Michombero who was deposed, he's
                    now dead. And he said “I'm a guest everywhere in this country” and he just came
                    and enjoyed himself. We had about a hundred guests at the party, a mixture of
                    Burundi and the foreign community — Bujumbura was the kind of place where you
                    knew everybody within five minutes and it was marvelous because you knew both
                    the president and the Greek butcher and everybody socialized together. Anyway,
                    there we were, a hundred people. We roasted the goats in the back yard — in
                    Burundi you eat goats, not lamb — and here came Michombero. He decided he'd have
                    to give a speech, so he got everyone in a circle and he said, (she mimics a
                    magisterial tone of voice) “Remember, Madame David, you can never lift your
                    shoulder above your ear.” I asked a Murundi what that meant, and what it meant
                    was that a wife should always remain subservient to her husband.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh-h-h-h, my goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It's true! Meanwhile, one of the guards had kicked the dog and she came
                    squealing in, lifting her leg, and disrupted the president's speech. I thought
                    they were ready to kill the dog on the spot, (after laughter) I wasn't sure what
                    was going to happen next. In any case, at 7 a.m. we were all still there,
                    because protocol demanded that no one could leave until the president leave. So
                    he was there, dancing away, drinking too much — everybody drank too much, I'll
                    talk about that later — anyway, finally I got aside a local Murundi businessman
                    and said, “Look here, wouldn't the president like to finish the evening
                    somewhere else?” The sun was up at seven and they took him away.</p>
                <p>Well, he would come back and visit us. He'd just drop in. The second time he did
                    that we thought, “Oh, my God, we've got to call the ambassador.” So we called
                    the ambassador, David Mark, this wonderful Soviet expert. And David Mark came,
                    and was stuck for eight hours.Well, the president consumed all of our beer. Then
                    we thought, “We'd better get some food in this man,” so I asked my cook, a
                    Zairean, who hated Michombero for who knows what reasons, maybe they were ethnic
                    conflicts. And he said, “I won't cook.” I said, “Oh yes, you will cook.” We did
                    manage to get some food on the table and then some coffee. Eight hours later the
                    ambassador finally could leave because Michombero left, and the ambassador said
                    to my husband, (very sotto voce) “You can handle this on your own the next
                    time!” (both laughing)“Don't call me. I trust you. Just report on it
                    afterwards.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, David Mark found out that I had been a Foreign Service officer. So he
                    started to use me totally unofficially to go and talk to people. This was the
                    first inkling I had — now, I wasn't working, my husband and I had worked
                    together a bit in Washington, which was very different because we were working
                    on completely different things and there was no threat. But I could feel just a
                    little resentment already that I was doing something that was not in my charter,
                    and why is the ambassador sending you off to do this, you know? I could say,
                    Well, I've met this person, I speak excellent French — Burundi had been Belgian
                    colony, they spoke Belgian French — he probably just wants to let me keep my
                    hand in.</p>
                <p>Then to add insult to injury I would write it up and it would go off as EMBOFF,
                    embassy officer having done this. I think David Harper resented this. I could
                    feel, too, that our relations as husband and wife suffered from the fact that I
                    was so active professionally, not just in that area but in the other area. There
                    was kind of a sense of competition. And that's something that you can't avoid. I
                    had always thought that perhaps if you were in different fields altogether, you
                    could escape it, but you can't. And if you are treading the same paths, it
                    really is a very tricky thing to handle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were admitted back into the Foreign Service
                        later, so that by the time you went to Dakar, you were a tandem spouse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I was a tandem spouse. I was admitted back, though, as a consular
                    officer. That was my price for re-joining the Foreign Service, and it really
                    wasn't my choice, but I decided that yes, it was worth doing. So I came back
                    from Addis Ababa, took the consular course, then went out and pretty much ran
                    the consular section in Dakar for a month, straight out of the consular course.
                    As soon as they had a second consular officer in Dakar, the consul became our
                    Regional consular officer and was moving around, so I did an awful lot of
                    consular work.If you've had consular work, you've had it — my heart was really
                    in political work, so I kept hoping I would get back to it.</p>
                <p>The ambassador gave me a chance to be Labor reporting officer too, because he
                    said consular work wasn't substantive and I really should have something
                    substantive to do. I ended up having a very, very heavy tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did his recognition of your work also contribute to some

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HARPER: I think so. I became the ambassador's pet and had a closer relationship
                    with him. I think in large part because of my French — He liked me — I was also
                    his official interpreter when we had visiting CODELs or Assistant Secretaries of
                    Defense, or whoever, and their official interpreter also with the president and
                    the different people they met. So I became very close to the ambassador. In
                    retrospect I think he took advantage of me. I can remember once when he asked me
                    to cook for him. I said, “No, I really don't think I'm going to do that.” I was
                    having a party for a friend of mine, a female diplomat, not an American, who'd
                    gotten pregnant and hadn't quite married her husband yet and I was having an
                    engagement for her because her ambassador had totally rejected her. I was having
                    85 people at the party to celebrate her engagement. The next day, my ambassador
                    had asked me to cook for him, his reason being that he was going to entertain
                    some Peoples Republic Chinese, and that his cook didn't do American cooking well
                    and he felt I could do good American food. Well, I can, but I really just
                    couldn't do it — a lunch after a big dinner, and I said no. The ambassador was
                    very resentful and he said, “My interests come first.” I said, “I just can't
                    postpone the party.” I also felt he wouldn't ask his male officers to cook.</p>
                <p>In any case that was the one time I turned the ambassador down, but on the whole
                    we had an excellent relationship, I certainly learned a lot frohim. I could
                    feel, though, that my husband didn't like the fact that I probably had an easier
                    entr�e to him. At Country Team meetings, as Labor reporting officer I got a lot
                    of recognition because it happened to be a time when labor became an important
                    factor in the country's stability and my labor contacts were giving me some very
                    interesting insights into what was happening, I was writing it up, and
                    Washington was interested. That too became just a little bit too much
                    competition. I felt really that my husband hadn't really gambled on my rising or
                    my being a good professional, it just hadn't occurred to him that that would be
                    so. When he married me I was just starting out, you know —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was just starting out, and you were already
                        speaking four languages —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: But then I had all that time off and he just hadn't bargained on how
                    quickly I'd advance and how well I would get along with other people. That's one
                    thing that being a Foreign Service brat does for you — you settle in fast! You
                    just arrive at a place and you know what it's going to take to get your health
                    going, get the household organized, you know how to run staff and servants, you
                    can pretty much tell what it's going to take to be a woman in that society and
                    to make it work. To be a professional woman in a Islamic African country like
                    Senegal takes a lot — to get these crusty Labor types to talk to you seriously.
                    Of course, you can do it but you just have a little extra advantage through
                    having grown up doing it.</p>

                <p>So Dakar was a good tour, except that I was exhausted. I have had something to
                    prove, too, and to my husband and to I think to myself, too. So it was a good
                    tour but I was just totally exhausted and ended up getting medevaced. Which was
                    probably the best thing that ever happened to me because I was able to rest up
                    and catch up. After that I came back and worked here for a year, then decided to
                    have a separated tour to Paris and was able to get just a fantastic job in the
                    Political section working on Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you finally arrived where you meant to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I finally arrived where I was meant to be. It was a time where the US was
                    heavily involved in negotiations on Angola. Chad was a big issue, the French
                    Government was working closely with us on that issue, and the kind of job that
                    probably will never happen again, where you made d�marches to the president's
                    son, Jean-Christophe Mitterand. It was a place too where I found that when
                    you're by yourself and you don't have all the other obligations, it really makes
                    a difference. When you're a tandem, you will have to run the household. I've
                    seen very few husbands who truly share in the work load.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's any kind of career woman's dilemma. No career woman
                        has equity in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: In Dakar I finally got my husband to do the fish and kind of meat
                    shopping at the market. He happened to like the March� Kermel, so he'd go and do
                    that on Saturdays, but the rest of it — just the organizing the household,
                    keeping a staff working the house, getting supplies in, working out the social
                    schedule; and by the time we were in Dakar, I was entertaining my professional
                    contacts and he was entertaining his.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably when he was entertaining his, you probably had to
                        do the work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: (laughing) Of course I did. I got so that — I finally got him to accept
                    that at some point I would want to have a working lunch at my house and I didn't
                    want him there. That was very hard for him to accept. He would just glower and
                    sit in the study and eat. In Senegal, it was very hard — as a woman you were
                    really much better off inviting people to your house than going to a restaurant;
                    especially if you were entertaining one of your contacts at the Foreign Ministry
                    or whatever, it just set a better tone to do it at home. But if you have the
                    husband there, they're going to defer to your husband — especially if he's of
                    higher rank, they're going to aim it towards — and then if the guest is your
                    contact, he's got tlearn to talk to you and not to call him.I got that worked
                    out but it just took time to arrange and you had to make sure that it didn't
                    inconvenience your husband when you did that.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>When I got to Paris, it was all gone, it was very easy to manage, there was
                    really so much more time available to me and an ability to concentrate really on
                    my own job. And going to parties too. If you're a tandem, you're going to his
                    parties as his wife, and then you're going to your parties for your contacts as
                    a professional, and it really doesn't always overlap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sure it doesn't. And so you end up going out twice
                        as much as you'd like to.</hi>

                <p>HARPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>July 10, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lisa, when we last talked you were discussing your
                        assignment to Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Paris was a separated tour for me. I'd realized that my marriage was not
                    going well. I was working in the embassy's Political Section on Africa and it
                    was a dream to be in Paris but working on Africa rather than vice versa.
                    Thinking back over that tour, I guess there again I felt that I had to prove
                    myself. I had not had a tour as a single officer, before. One of the things that
                    you find very soon if you're there single is that first of all, you're put into
                    the very worst housing that they can think of. So I was shown various rabbit
                    warrens and was lucky that the Political Counselor took up my case with Admin so
                    that I finally got a good apartment.</p>
                <p>Now, Paris apartments are totally unfurnished. Moving into one was when I needed
                    a wife.Arriving as officer you're expected to hit the ground running, you're
                    supposed to be out working in the embassy, doing your job, going out to
                    receptions at night. So what I did was appeal to my parents and they came and
                    helped me set myself up in all the little things, like finding lighting fixtures
                    or — Paris apartments come with nothing, even the ones the embassy rents. So you
                    have to put in closets. They helped me with that.</p>
                <p>I was very lucky to be working for a very good officer, who also helped me get on
                    the social circuit. This is something also that single officers face — unless
                    they establish a really close friendship, they're not going to get the
                    invitations that the ambassador doesn't want, it's probably going to go to a
                    male officer. You have to really fight to say, “I need to be there, too. I can
                    make contacts there, too.” After a while I got so that if one of the officers
                    was going to a party and his wife didn't want to go, he would invite me along
                    with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this ever make trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HARPER: (laughing) Yes, it did make trouble. There was jealousy. “Why is Lisa
                    getting all the invitations?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't mean professional jealousy, I meant was there
                        jealousy among the wives, why are there husbands around —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No. Wives didn't care, wives at that point were burnt out with
                    receptions. In Paris it was a real struggle, you know, to connect with a husband
                    who was working up to the last minute, then get dressed up, find a parking place
                    or take a cab or take the M�tro, get to the reception; nobody wanted to do it.
                    No problem with the wives. And by then I'd met the wives, I felt really no
                    threat from the wives. They didn't feel threatened in a sexual way, they didn't
                    feel I was after their husband. It was the other people in my section, my fellow
                    officers, male and female. So what I had to do was to share the invitations.
                    Once I got that started, everybody thought “great idea.” I lost out a little bit
                    on that one but I couldn't have gone on all of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it made you friends in the embassy by sharing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, I made friends. And that's what you have to do, you really have to
                    build up a network. And you also find that in a big place like Paris, single
                    women have a terrible time. I didn't, I had friends in Paris, and I'm
                    resourceful. In small posts you find that there's a social life that's created,
                    but in the big posts, especially the secretaries but also the female officers
                    can be very, very lonely. Nobody is thinking of them. Entertaining is geared to
                    couples; and informal entertaining is not going to include these women who
                    really desperately need to be included. That's why you see so many kind of
                    liaisons between older women and young Marine guards or people who are
                    available. It's something I think the Foreign Service has to think more
                    about.You've got the CLO Office, and it depends on who the CLO is. Maybe the CLO
                    will take care of these people and kind of bring them into activities, but there
                    really has to be a more systematic reaching out to them. Because what you find
                    is that there are people who'll just go home after work and drink.</p>
                <p>This might be a good time to talk about alcoholism. There's a tremendous amount,
                    I think, of drinking that goes on. It's just part of our profession in the
                    Foreign Service. Think about it: You go to something at lunchtime, it's a vin
                    d'honneur, you raise your glass of wine. Okay. In the evenings you'll have a
                    reception. If you're invited to a representational dinner at another embassy,
                    they're going to throw out four or five different kinds of wine, and cognac.
                    Before you know it you are drinking every single night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not just in Paris! Even in the smallest post in
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HARPER: Not just in Paris — anywhere. And Bujumbura. And I'll tell you one thing
                    that's efficiently organized is getting the liquor in. The support flights bring
                    in food. If you're at the end of the earth in Bujumbura or Addis Ababa, your
                    liquor's coming in regularly, and in the hard places, of course maybe there's a
                    rationalization, in a way, to drink. And I think also that we really have been
                    remiss in systematically teaching people how to recognize — I mean, supervisors
                    and people themselves, teaching them to recognize the symptoms of alcoholism.
                    I've had a lot of experience with alcoholics, so I know what to spot. And now I
                    can read a personnel file and can look at certain things and I can tell, “Ah,
                    there may be a drinking problem.” You know, people that come in late to work,
                    especially after a weekend; people who show personality changes — if you're
                    drinking too much you tend really to become bitter against the system, and
                    paranoid. Not that this is a symptom only of alcoholics, but you're going to
                    find, for example, trembling hands in the morning, people who isolate
                    themselves, somebody who wants to go home early and doesn't want to go out.
                    There are people who reorganize their whole lives so that they can drink. In
                    Paris we had problems with people just going home and leaving their safes
                    open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That could be a real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It's a real problem —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not just a social problem, it's a problem for the

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It's an institutional problem. And there's also a real reluctance to
                    confront the employee. If it's becoming an office problem, it must be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even if you saw it incipiently, wouldn't early

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, exactly. I know personally of one case where a wife was drinking at
                    home, she was very unhappy in Paris, and I couldn't get anyone in my upper
                    management to address the fact that this woman was calling her husband every
                    hour on the hour, that she'd been mugged in the M�tro because she was drunk, she
                    was picked up by the police on suspicion of prostitution because she was
                    wandering around in inappropriate clothing but also under the influence of
                    alcohol. You know, there are psychiatrists who can be brought in, it is kept
                    confidential, there is rehabilitation; and yet there's often a conspiracy of
                    silence. And we think we're helping the employee by not telling anyone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. It's something very well known in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The institution is set up to handle it but it's just not applied enough,
                    or maybe sometimes applied too late. The question of whether or not you can get
                    the person into treatment is another issue. But I also think there has to be a
                    real effort by employees — this is something you and I talked about — to have
                    functions that don't involve drinking. Just to say, we're going to have a tea
                    party, or we're going to have some kind of an outing or an activity; that we're
                    not just sitting down and drinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That reminds me — I remember talking about this before — I
                        asked you if you thought whether the ambassador had an influence on the
                        community, whether he could set an example, or whether he could not attend
                        certain things like the typical Marine beer bash — can the ambassador take
                        the lead in showing people what is regarded as appropriate or inappropriate
                        drinking behavior?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, absolutely. I found, for example, in Paris , when I was there our
                    ambassador was a political appointee, who was very religious. He certainly
                    didn't hesitate to set the lead. We had “Christian aerobics” in the embassy,
                    (laughter) it was called Body and Soul and you could go over to the residence
                    twice a week and do your exercises to “Jesus Loves Me” and other songs. So, if
                    you can do that, you can also say, this is an area of concern to me. And usually
                    ambassadors do take the lead in matters like organizing Christmas parties for
                    children and national holidays like Fourth of July. But in my whole life I can
                    recall very few instances where an ambassador has taken the lead to discuss
                    social issues, or societal problems. It doesn't have to be “we've got too many
                    drunks in this embassy.” It can be, “These are questions of concern to me.” You
                    can bring in lecturers, you can have a concert come out or even your regional
                    medical officer come out and have seminars on certain subjects. I've seen it
                    happen —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there's no policy directing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I'm not sure what the policy is, there might be but I haven't seen
                    it applied in a systematic way. It has to be periodic, because you have
                    tremendous rotation of personnel, you've got to keep these issues in front of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I think people forget. In the United States there's
                        recently been such a decline in drinking, it's now pretty “unfashionable” to
                        drink, as well as to smoke. This isn't the case with other societies
                        overseas. As far as I could tell, there has been at least during the 1980s
                        no significant drop in smoking and drinking among other nationalities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. Especially not among the Frenc(laughing) or any other
                    nationalities. Not to single them out —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think anyone else really has tumbled to this yet.
                        It may be that the people back in the U.S. don't realize the pressures that
                        our personnel are under when they go overseas and drink and smoke and do
                        other kinds of harmful behavior.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. In the States, you know you go into a library or book
                    store, there are self-help sections. You have really an effort to educate people
                    on all these problems. This doesn't exist — of course, you don't have feedback
                    from your families overseas. Now, maybe a family member who would say, “Hey, I
                    think you're drinking too much.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Or even someone to go to. It seems to me another
                        thing that's needed is support for the non-drinking spouse or teenager or
                        whatever. When one member of the family is drinking excessively there's so
                        little support for the non-drinking member — no AlAnon or some such. So they
                        themselves are lacking support and can't do anything to help the person
                        who's drinking too much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. And they're afraid that if they go to a supervisor or a
                    resident doctor, somehow the husband's career will suffer for it. The word has
                    to go out that “this is confidential.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that there are channels you should go through. People
                        need to be trained in that before going overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And at periodic intervals. Maybe somebody could have
                        something like this when they're a junior officer but they sort of forget it
                        after ten years. Well, when they get another course in mid-career, it ought
                        to be reenforcing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I think we've done very well in recognizing, for instance, the tensions
                    that children are under when they come back from overseas — you know, the sort
                    of societal disconnect. But I don't see the same sort of attention given to
                    alcoholism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There isn't much for spouses, either. My feeling was that
                        when you returned to the States, you were supposed to deal with culture
                        shock on your own. It was often very disorienting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. But now my colleagues with children tell me that there's an attempt
                    to bring the children together, so that they have dances to go to when they come
                    home, and there are support groups —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:There are good ones for the children, bu(she laughs) I
                        don't think there's anything for the spouses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER:Yes! The services are there, the plumbing is there but you have to
                    encourage them to draw the spouses in. I mean, there's a wonderful computerized
                    network for spouses who want to find jobs and use their skills. But the word has
                    to go out that this is available, it has to really be more of an outreach. You
                    don't always know your entitlements or what's available here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another burning issue, which is not so much from your
                        Paris experience or any of it since Dakar but from your earlier years, is
                        this whole idea of recompense for the spouse for her effort. As you said, in
                        Dakar you were not only doing your own job, you also had to be the support
                        system for your husband's job. What are your feelings about paying
                        spouses?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HARPER: I do think that spouses who are now working in an intra-embassy job but
                    who are helping their husbands by entertaining, should be paid. There's a lot of
                    debate about how this would be done, but I'm aware that a lot of other foreign
                    services do pay the wives. I think there's no question the institution benefits.
                    If you've been to some dinner parties where the working wife has said the
                    husband has gone down to the local Chinese restaurant and brought back carry
                    out, you're not going to make the same impression as the woman who stayed at
                    home, cooked a home-made American meal, set up her table, and put on a
                    first-class performance. And I think, also, you'd eliminate a lot of resentment.
                    I mean, there's a generation of women who really resent being asked to do these
                    things. In my day, you were just expected to do it. I think that even some kind
                    of non-monetary recognition would help a little bit. But certainly money, too.
                    The way I would see it, I don't think you want the wife to feel like she's an
                    employee, because chances are if she's chosen not to have a full time job
                    outside the embassy now because she preferred that way of life, you don't want
                    to tie her into something where she feels obligated to work 40 hours a week. But
                    a contractual arrangement where she gets paid so much per hour for her
                    contributions to the community — and I think we'd have to carefully define what
                    is a community involvement. Charity work where she's representing the U.S.?
                    Entertaining? Diplomatic wives' meetings? These are things that really do help.
                    And there's also no doubt in my mind that a wife who's willing to go to the
                    diplomatic wives' meeting is going to help her husband make the sort of contacts
                    in the community that are going to help his career. We should tap into this. We
                    should help these women, also, to have a little more feeling of self-worth in
                    the process. I tell you, it's very hard on you — and I can say this because I've
                    been non-employed wife overseas. Just to have someone say, “Oh, you're just a
                    housewife...” Well, after a while you start feeling like — just a housewife.
                    There you are, your efforts are being recognized for what they're worth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people have suggested that one way to do it would be
                        to give Social Security credits for that time, to be included in whatever
                        you earn in Social Security by working in the U.S. during stateside tours.
                        You could eventually build up to having some real equity in the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Right. We now have “former spouse legislation” so that if you were
                    married and helped your husband overseas, you do get some recompense if you
                    divorce. But that is probably not enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but it helps a lot. When I was in that situation and
                        resented going to those diplomatic wives' meetings, I was told to get out
                        there and earn my pension. But I went with a happier heart because I felt I
                        would get recognition. But I agree with you , it's the recognition that is
                        very, very important. You need to have some status so that you have some
                        self-esteem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. Also to motivate you to do your very best at this
                    job.Because there's a minimal performance and there's a maximum performance.If
                    you're being paid for it, you're probably going to give more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only would you get paid, you would also get the
                        recognition in the form of some kind of efficiency report. And your
                        efficiency report would go in your dossier, and that would be an even more
                        powerful motivator, I think, to do your best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Right. Then, also, if you have to reenter the job market when you come
                    back to the States, you have at least documented what you have done. I read
                    about a Foreign Service spouse who's now doing wonderful dinners for the
                    National Gallery. Well: this is a direct use of what she learned overseas. I
                    think there are a lot of other wives there who entertain at a high level who
                    could provide the same service, but to get a foot in the door in the job market
                    they need other people's word that they've done it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It take(laughing) a lot of executive ability to put on a
                        high-level dinner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. I think this is not an issue that's going to go away,
                    either. Okay, we're going to have women who for love of their husbands are going
                    to drop out during a certain period, raise their children, but let's use them.
                    This is a resource, not a problem, it's a resource to be utilized. I think the
                    Foreign Service has thought of it as a problem, that “spouses aren't willing to
                    work as much any more.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. It just has to be done differently, structured
                        differently. What do you think about the Tandem Couples program as far as
                        you've been able to observe it and from your own experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it's not working well, I see the hopes of a few years ago
                    diminishing, I see a lot of frustration on the part of management because,
                    basically, now, you have to opt for whose career takes precedence. What this
                    means in practice, in every case that I've seen and no doubt there are others,
                    is that the wife suffers: her career suffers. She makes the best of it, she
                    says, okay, I'm still working. But I see more and more tendency to say, “Okay,
                    you said you'd be available world-wide, we need you here, we need you there.” A
                    split-up couple is not what they bargained for.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HARPER: It's not tandem. I don't have any solution for this one, except that
                    there too I think we tend to look at tandems as a problem. I hear a lot about
                    how the rights of single officers are being violated because a tandem is taking
                    a slot that could have gone to a single or to a marrieperson whose spouse is not
                    working in the Foreign Service. I really think we need to have a fresh look at
                    it. It can work, and we're all supposed to be multi-talented. In most embassies
                    people are doing at least one job, one discipline. You can also be recycled to
                    do some- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think we'll look to work in other [agencies]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Not only that. I think it's time to look at the benefits of tandems. As
                    tandem you get a cheaper deal: they're both living together, that means one less
                    housing unit to provide. And moving costs. In Third World countries, you have
                    two people who are committed to making an awful assignment work. I found, too,
                    that tandems are more readily accepted in hardship posts. If you're both in
                    Addis Ababa or Ouagadougou or whatever, fine, nobody's fighting for those jobs
                    and you have two people who can help — you know, if you're in a place that's
                    perhaps especially politically difficult, you're going to have a built-in
                    support system right there to help you, and you're not going to be as lonely,
                    and you're not going to be as vulnerable as somebody who's just out there —</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right, because a tandem knows why they're there. They have two
                    jobs, she has a stake in it, and she's going to make it work. Actually, my whole
                    feeling is, that right now for it to work, it's the wife who “has to make it
                    work.” It's the woman officer who usually — you know, opting for whose career
                    takes precedence means, in fact, that it's usually the husband's. There are some
                    exceptions out there but I found too that men who have made the choice to be
                    Number Two, are looked down upon by their male colleagues, they're made fun
                    of.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I find that there's a real reluctance to give the woman part of the
                    partnership the better of the two jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And for it to work, women have to realize that this is the

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HARPER: I think for now there's a certain amount of sacrifice that just goes with
                    the territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not that different from being a working wife in the
                        States, after all. Most women in the U.S. have the responsibility of running
                        a household in addition to their career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's true. But there you just have the added burden of making it work
                    overseas. The whole infrastructure you can count on — in a lot of countries I've
                    been in, the shops are closed on Sundays or they close at 7pm. Just getting
                    enough food on the table — you have to take time off to set up a dinner party,
                    and most of the time it's the wife who does it. I've seen very few husbands who
                    truly share 50/50 in terms of living part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same as in our society, of course. It's not going to
                        be that much different overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No. And also, the problem of couples who're just living for the work and
                    who leave very little time for themselves. This is when you start seeing
                    tremendous tensions in the marriage. Each one is out there doing their job and
                    they don't spend enough time together to keep the marriage going. I think, too,
                    supervisors have a role to play there, to call in the officers and say, “Look
                    here, take time for yourself.” Not to expect so much. Just to tell them at some
                    point, “Take a vacation together.” We're still pretty much workaholics. We're
                    Americans and we work hard but there's a point where you have to give permission
                    to your tandem just to go off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, because I'm sure they're out there busily
                        proving themselves, that this can work, that it's not going to be a
                        liability for either one of them, especially not for the man, et cetera, et
                        cetera.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. Because there's a feeling on the part of the older generation that
                    you're getting two for the price of one. You do one for the price of two, in
                    effect; that you're not getting two full officers' performance out of the
                    tandem. So there's a pressure to produce —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think, given the statistics I've heard, namely that
                        something like 50 percent of our Foreign Service officer group are
                        unmarried—you were telling me before we began taping how some people have
                        coped with this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, now there's more acceptance of people who don't marry. I know of
                    one Foreign Service couple who waited five years to marry because she was not
                    ready to give up her job. She was a reporter, he was Foreign Service, and they
                    lived together. Finally, of course she made the sacrifice and went off to this
                    godforsaken country with him and just accepted that she would put her career on
                    hold for a while. I think a lot of people just figure that maybe marriage and a
                    Foreign Service career are incompatible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm beginning to think so myself! (both laughing) It's a
                        great shame. There are so many things undermining it, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: In Addis Ababa I almost sensed a deliberate policy of sending single
                    people there because they would be less problems to administer - you know, no
                    fuss, no children, no wives.So you had an embassy that was staffed almost
                    exclusively with single people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see any negative aspects to that? What if we had a
                        basically single Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, I do. I think, first of all, for just the emotional stability, in
                    many cases it's simply — I think also that most people do want to get married
                    and this will be a goal. If you have to sacrifice one of your goals, it's always
                    going to be very difficult. Maybe you're not going to be wholeheartedly for your
                    job. Another thing: it gives a very skewed idea of American society. We're
                    representing American society and we should have the full diversity — single
                    people, married people, people with children. I think also that single people
                    entertain differently. We need to have — this is all generalizations, but
                    chances are married people are going to get more involved in the community than
                    single people who are probably going out more one on one. I just think it's
                    unhealthy to have only one choice there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think the Foreign Service could do to make it
                        easier on married people, whether tandems or not?I mean, we've made a lot of
                        suggestions — recognizing the wife's contributions, having counseling for
                        alcoholism. Going back to your experiences as a child you said that there
                        have been a lot of changes, a lot of progress made in handlinchildren's
                        problems but can you think of anything in that realm that you would like to
                        see improved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HARPER: I think it's not so much for the children overseas, except to make
                    parents aware that they have to carry America with them. It's very important for
                    children to have American rituals. To make sure that the children learn to speak
                    good English. I know it would have been much easier for me if my parents had
                    taught me to write English. It's great to be in a French school but when you
                    come home, if you can't write your own language and you have no sense of
                    composition, you're going to be at a real disadvantage. And to make you feel
                    like an American.I think also you've got to worry that when people come back,
                    there is a problem of transition. Almost any child who's been raised overseas is
                    going to have a hard time with his U.S. peers. You are different. You're
                    probably more sophisticated, you certainly dress differently, you talk
                    differently, you're interested in different things. And the parents have to be
                    there to talk it over and to put the child together with other children who've
                    gone through the same experience. So that there isn't this total culture clash.
                    I think it's also important to plan so that the child has four good years of
                    high school in one place, preferably in America. The child who's going to go to
                    college in America has to have an American high school experience.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. Because if that's the society you're going to live in, well then
                    that's an investment I think has to be made. And I'm looking at a lot of my
                    friends who've been to foreign schools until they went to college, and then have
                    had a difficult time adjusting to life in America. It's just a real transition.
                    You go through the French school system and then all of a sudden, BAM, you're
                    thrown into an American university environment, and while academically you may
                    be far ahead, socially you're just not going to fit in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the whole four years in high school in the

                    laughs again) I'm not blaming the Foreign Service for that!</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: So much can be done just talking about it with a child. I do think that
                    Foreign Service parents don't tal— this is another great generalization but I
                    remember my father's always been absent and not there to talk when I was growing
                    up. You think of a Foreign Service officer's life: he comes home, changes, runs
                    off to a reception; or he's late drafting his telegrams at night. There really
                    has to be more time just to go home and be with the kids.</p>

                        draft more telegrams, and sometimes you're in places where the work week is
                        different from the one in the States and you have to be there to make sure
                        your cables get out on Monday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. And to really look at your child critically, you know. My
                    brother had a learning disability but, of course, he was in French schools and
                    they just thought he was retarded. When he came back to the U.S., his
                    intelligence proved normal but he was dyslexic. In those days, the therapy was
                    called “remedial reading” and after four years of that he was okay. But I think
                    the problem probably would have been diagnosed earlier if my parents had been
                    more careful about just... And we were left mainly in the care of nannies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And once we came back to the States, my mother became a traditional
                    mother again, she was wonderful, she was home every day when we came home. But
                    that wasn't the pattern when I was growing up in Paris. There was just such an
                    all-enveloping social life that took so much of her attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That can be true even in a small post. You can have a very
                        busy social life, sometimes even more so. The most hectic social life we
                        ever had was in Mozambique. There was such a dearth of information that
                        people thought they had to get together socially every evening and compare
                        notes. I imagine this was the case in Bujumbura and similar posts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. In Bujumbura it was just constant — you didn't have all the things
                    like television, and in those days no videos. We had reels that the Air Force or
                    Army would send us, old movies that by the time they reached us would break
                    halfway throug(laughing). But there was nothing to do except socialize, and
                    people socialized with other adults and the children were left with the maids.
                    It's also not just a question of their missing their parents but also the
                    children are missing out intellectually in a lot of these places. You know,
                    you're with an African servant who can't read or write —</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's very difficult, because there you have the pressure to not let it
                    affect you. It's a perception thing. There's very little sympathy for a tandem
                    wife who has sick children, so tandem wives will just do anything so that nobody
                    says, “Oh, well, she took two weeks off to get her children settled into
                    school.” I've seen different ways of handling that. I have a friend, part of a
                    tandem, who travels with a Thai couple at great financial expense to them, but
                    she said she couldn't work knowing her children were not being cared for by
                    someone who would know whom to call. The couple speaks English, always knows how
                    to take care of a child in any emergency.Not everybody can do this. It's just a
                    tremendous pressure. You're always torn. And there again, in my experience it's
                    the woman who bears the brunt of that.Always worrying about the children and
                    getting them equipped for school, clothed, and all the things you have to
                    do.</p>
                <p>I think somehow there has to be some talk — it's very difficult for a young
                    couple to work these things out. Young couples think, oh, love is grand, love's
                    going to solve everything. And I think also some talking to them about the
                    problems of tandems, so they can recognize the danger signals, if they're
                    listening, just so it's in the back of their minds. And there's plenty of
                    literature on this subject, too. What are the stresses on a tandem family? What
                    can you do? And to let the husband and the wife, too, she really has set
                    expectations and the standards from the beginning. I know this from personal
                    experience: you can't try to change the rules at mid-term. It's very difficult
                    to do that.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Right. And the truth of the matter is, too, that as you grow older you
                    have less energy. You have boundless energy at the beginning, and enthusiasm,
                    and you can do it, sure, you can do it all. But then after a while you start
                    having health problems, you grow resentful. But then, there you are, your
                    husband says, “Well, my goodness, you never objected to doing all the shopping
                    before, and all the direction of the servants, what's going on now?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's when they get rid of the old wife and get a new
                        wife, a young wife. (both laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Probably a foreigner, who they think will be more compliant!</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: So just to deal with the educational problem — not that that's going to
                    solve it but that's just one little thing to do, and to get those rules of the
                    game established early on in a relationship, and see if it works, and think
                    twice about marrying the guy — I mean, even discuss it before marriage, think
                    twice about it. Because what happens too often, and this is talking from
                    personal experience with friends, is that they'll meet the man of their life,
                    who'll say, “Sure! I'm all for your career” but he really doesn't mean it. What
                    he means is, “Well, if it suits me, that'll be fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “I want something to brag about to my friends.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes. He likes it, he likes the extra money, certainly he likes the
                    prestige of having a wife who's a professional woman, but when it comes time to,
                    “But, I want to go to Ouagadougou, Honey, what do you mean there's no job for
                    you there? Well, of course, you'll take a leave-of-absence.” I know of an
                    engagement broken off, by a friend of mine, because the husband-to-be had just
                    neglected to tell his fianc�e that he'd accepted a job —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) It just seems like a little oversight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: — and a job that was going to make it impossible for her to work at their
                    first post. It was devastating to her but she broke the engagement. She also saw
                    this as a flagrant lack of trust. This is 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing what I know, that seems outrageous even by the
                        usual standards.</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HARPER: But there are still a lot of people who will talk one day. And also a lot
                    of men who pretend to be liberated but who really aren't, and they're the most
                    dangerous, (both laugh heartily) because they've learned all the right tunes but
                    you'll never get them to sing them in public. So picking the right mate sure
                    pays off for a tandem assignment. But if you're going to go into that, if you're
                    thinking about it, you've really got to make sure the man is all for it. And
                    that you bid together and just see what develops. I think also that if you're a
                    tandem you have to lobby for assignments in a way tha— well, you always have to
                    lobby for assignments but you really have to think way ahead on where you want
                    to do and find prospects. And you're probably going to have to stay longer in a
                    post than you'd choose to otherwise, because it's a temptation. You've got
                    twjobs, you're probably going to keep them; and that's another area where
                    tandems suffer. Of course, not to mention when you reach a very senior level,
                    then, forget it, it's impossible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you really would have to have separated
                        assignments.</hi>

                <p>HARPER: I gues(heavy sigh) those are my thoughts for today.</p>
