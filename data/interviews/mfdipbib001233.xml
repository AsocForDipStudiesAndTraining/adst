                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 27, 1998. The interview is with Robert Mark
                        Ward, known as Mark. Mark, how long were you with the Foreign Assistance
                        Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was with AID for 28 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I came to Washington from the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard,
                    where I spent two years on a Master's program 1959-1961. I came to Washington in
                    August 1961, while the International Cooperation Administration and the
                    Development Loan Fund were in the process of turning into the Agency for
                    International Development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that later. Give us a thumbnail sketch
                        of your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Overview of career</p>
                <p>WARD: I spent my first few years with AID (1961 to 1965) in what was then the Far
                    East Bureau. I was an Assistant Desk Officer assigned to the Burma, Thailand,
                    Indonesia area. The Office Director was David Burgess. The Burma Desk Officer
                    was Ed Felder, who had come from the DLF. He was replaced by Bill Small, who
                    later went out to Rangoon as the AID Affairs Officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My first foreign assignment was in Egypt, where I went in the fall of 1965. We
                    stayed until June 1967 when, during the Six Day War between Egypt and Israel,
                    Gamal Abdul Nasser broke diplomatic relations with the United States and the
                    Americans were kicked out. My wife and I then went to Pakistan for four years
                    from 1967 to 1971. We returned to the United States to spend a year in
                    Princeton, where AID sent me on a sabbatical to the Woodrow Wilson School for
                    Public and International Affairs. In 1972 I returned to AID/Washington, where I
                    worked in the Office of Program Development and Project Review and the Bureau
                    for Program and Policy Coordination for a couple of years. From 1974 to 1977 I
                    was in the Office of Near East and North African Affairs in the Near East
                    Bureau. Tony Schwarzwalder was the Office Director there. I was the OIC of
                    Portugal, Cyprus, Turkey, and Special Programs. From 1977 to 1981 I spent four
                    years in Morocco as Program Officer. When I arrived the Mission Director was Al
                    Disdier, who was replaced by Harold Fleming.I returned to Washington in 1981.
                    For a year I was the Energy Advisor in the Bureau for Africa applying some of
                    the things I had learned in putting together an energy program in Morocco. From
                    1982 to 1984, I replaced John Blumgart as the Chief of the Special Projects
                    Division in the Office of Technical Resources in the Bureau for Africa. We
                    worked on renewable energy, but increasingly on environmental and forestry
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>I went back to the Bureau for Policy Program Coordination, the Office of Donor
                    Coordination, where I was the Chief of the United Nations Division for three
                    years dealing with AID's relations with the various UN development organizations
                    (UNDP, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, the UN Environment Program and others.</p>
                <p>I went to Egypt for a second time in 1987, staying for two years until I retired
                    from AID on the Fourth of July 1989. There I was a Capital Development Officer
                    for the Directorate of Trade and Investment, led at the time by Gregory Huger,
                    who is now somewhere in the wilds of Central Asia as an AID Representative, I
                    believe. After leaving AID, I've done a bit of consulting during the last few
                    years. I've stayed marginally in touch with AID, so I know a little bit about
                    what's developed since I left. However, I expect I've now outlived my
                    usefulness, because more recent AID retirees are perhaps more familiar with, and
                    more interested in, AID's current development vocabulary and concepts.</p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Where are you from? Where did you grow up? What
                        about your education? Discuss anything in that that would explain why you
                        got into this business rather than something else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WARD: Careers are often accidental. I was born in Buffalo, New York, September
                    24, 1927. I served in the Army in the German occupation in 1946-47. I went to
                    Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut, where, in addition to receiving
                    a wonderful liberal arts education, I remember playing soccer a couple of times
                    with Haven North, my interviewer. He was pretty good, actually. I graduated in
                    1949 and went out West with a couple of friends of mine. We were planning to
                    work in the wheat harvest, but the wheat crop that year wasn't very good, so I
                    got to San Francisco. In order to get back, I signed on board as a deckboy on a
                    Norwegian merchant ship and went around the world. It was 1950. We stopped in
                    the Philippines, Indonesia, India, then independent only since 1947, went up the
                    Persian Gulf, through the Suez Canal, saw the famous statue of Ferdinand de
                    Lesseps in Port Said (this was before the 1952 revolution which brought Nasser
                    to power), stopped in Genoa, Christopher Columbus' hometown, and got back to New
                    York in June 1950. So I suppose that, having seen Europe immediately after World
                    War II, I was exposed to the colonies just after independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: History and Modern Literature. Not your obvious preparation for economic
                    development work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there wasn't much on development in those days
                        anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's true. But I had gotten a certain perspective by living in Europe
                    after the war in 1946. I was interested in international affairs. I had studied
                    French in high school and German in college. The first time I had had any
                    contact with other societies was in my cruise with the Norwegians. I spent a
                    month on the beach in Bombay, living at the Prince of Wales Seamen's Club and
                    wandering around the city on a bicycle. A different world, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you staying on the beach in Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Actually, being “on the beach” is a seamen's term for waiting between
                    ships. In Bombay our ship's captain got orders to go down to Australia instead
                    of continuing toward the Persian Gulf, Europe and New York. I didn't want to go
                    to Australia, so I tried to figure out some way of getting off the ship. I
                    pretended that I had an appendicitis. I got as far as the Queen Elizabeth
                    Hospital where they were about to operate, but miraculously the pain
                    disappeared. The doctor realized what had happened, of course, and the Norwegian
                    Shipping Agent said “Okay, we'll just put you on our next ship headed for
                    Europe.” The next ship arrived a month later and by June I was back in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position on the ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was a deck boy. I was paid $35 a month plus board and room. It was a
                    veritable United Nations on this ship. We had people from England, Norway,
                    Sweden, Denmark, Australia. I was the only American actually. It was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>By the time I got back my parents had bought a farm near Lake George, New York
                    and retired to the Adirondack Mountains. I went up to the Adirondacks and stayed
                    with them and helped get their farm in shape. Before I knew it, I was involved
                    in the logging business and housing construction, where I stayed for five years.
                    That was enough. Finally, in 1956, I went to Europe for a student work camp - in
                    fact, for three student work camps. One was in Berlin. One was outside of Tivoli
                    in Italy. The third was in Hof on the border between East Germany and West
                    Germany. We did things of the kind Peace Corps does, but the Peace Corps didn't
                    exist then. The program was run by the Quakers - the American Friends Service
                    Committee, which is active today in a variety of domestic and international
                    activities to help the poor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you account for this wanderlust, always wanting to
                        travel all around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I guess it was perhaps inherited. My father used to tell wonderful stories
                    about his period in France during and after the First World War. After seeing
                    combat during the First World War, he worked with the Hoover Food Relief
                    Administration, delivering humanitarian relief to feed people in France and
                    Germany. At one point, his letters report, there was even some talk of actually
                    providing food aid to Eastern Europe and Russia. This was in 1918 and 1919. My
                    mother was for five years in the 1920s an English teacher in South China, and
                    she had a lot of stories to tell about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. That explains it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: After the student work camps in 1956, I came back to the Quaker Center in
                    Paris, which at that time was at 110 Avenue Mozart in the 16th Arrondissement.
                    It no longer exists. I wanted to stay in Paris a bit longer. I found it very
                    romantic. I wanted to go to school there. I got a job as a night clerk in a
                    hotel and inscribed in the Sorbonne for a year. A number of interesting things
                    were going on at that point. There was the Algerian War, which France was
                    conducting, and Algerians from both the French side and the revolutionary side
                    were in Paris. There was a lot of tension. One time some agents of the FLN - the
                    Front de la Liberation Nationale - shot a young Algerian in a cafe just under my
                    apartment because he had not paid his contribution.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I got a part time job as a filing clerk at the American embassy, which was rather
                    interesting. It wound up that I stayed for two years. My wife and I were married
                    there. Our son was born there. But about the time General De Gaulle took power,
                    we came back to the United States. I inscribed in the Center for Middle Eastern
                    Studies at Harvard in 1959 for a two year program in Middle Eastern studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Middle Eastern studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Well, I guess I wasn't smart enough to get into the Russian Research
                    Center. I would have loved to have become a Kremlinologist. In retrospect, it
                    was probably a fairly good idea. I rather imagine that there are a lot of
                    unemployed Kremlinologists around. But I had gotten interested in what was
                    happening in North Africa because of my exposure to the Algerians. The Middle
                    East was interesting. So, I spent a couple of years there. Like various of my
                    fellow students, we were wondering what to do to get employment afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write a thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, only various course papers - government, politics, economics,
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Joined USAID in 1961</p>
                <p>WARD: Many of the people at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies intended to
                    continue to be academics and do research of one kind or another relating to the
                    Middle East. One of them was Carl Brown, a former State Department officer who
                    went on to become director of the Princeton Middle East Institute. A number of
                    others thought that they might be able to sell their Middle Eastern skills to
                    the oil companies. The oil companies' general response was, “All you need to
                    know about the Middle East we can teach you in two or three months. What we want
                    is somebody who knows about oil.” That was a disappointment for many of us. As
                    it turned out, one of my friends came to me one day and said, “Look, let's go
                    down and take the Federal Government Management Intern examination.” This was a
                    program to encourage people to go into all branches of the federal government. I
                    hadn't thought about that. I said, “I don't want to be a manager. I don't really
                    like that idea.” But I went down anyway because I couldn't think of any reason
                    to say “No.” As it turned out, I passed it. My friend didn't. He went on to
                    become a wealthy banker. But what the Management Intern Examination yielded was
                    two choices. First, I could become a statistician in the Bureau of Labor
                    Statistics analyzing statistics about the Middle East. Or I could go down to ICA
                    and join this newly formed foreign aid organization called “AID.” I chose the
                    latter because it sounded more interesting. The Personnel officer who
                    interviewed me said, “You know, it's nice that you have a Master's degree. As
                    far as we're concerned, its main value is that it shows you can read and write.”
                    By thus assuring the foreign aid program that I was not illiterate, I joined the

                <p>WARD: I joined the foreign aid program in August 1961.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any kind of orientation when you joined?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I don't think so. I don't think there was anybody who knew enough to be
                    able to tell what it was all about. This was a period in the summer of 1961 when
                    ICA, which had been organized functionally - into offices like “O/FOOD,” for
                    example, which dealt with agriculture and food matters - was being reorganized
                    along regional lines, with regional bureaus. There was a lot of informal
                    recruitment of people. People would be going around the corridors trying to
                    hijack the better people they knew from different bureaus so that they could
                    take them into their bureau. There was a lot of disorder and corridor
                    politicking to try to get a critical mass of good people for the bureau that you
                    happened to be in. That didn't last very long, naturally. By the fall of 1961,
                    AID was pretty well in place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Assigned to Southeast Asia division - 1961</p>
                <p>WARD: I was assigned to the office dealing with Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia.
                    The Office Director was a charming gentleman named David Burgess, whose
                    background was rather interesting. He had been a Peace Corps director in
                    Indonesia. He was an ordained minister who had been very actively involved in
                    social service. In fact, he had been active in the south in the 1950s in union
                    organizing in textile mills, which was quite dangerous. He was a marvelous
                    Office Director. His deputy was Leonard Durso, a person who stayed around and
                    whom I met repeatedly in various other assignments. Edward Felder, and later, F.
                    William Small were the Burma Desk Officers. Bill Small later became the AID
                    director in Burma.</p>

                <p>WARD: We had a small AID program - too small to warrant a full-fledged USAID
                    mission. We had an AID Representative. The most dramatic thing was the Rangoon
                    to Mandalay Highway. We had contracted with the Army Corps of Engineers to build
                    a highway from Rangoon to Mandalay. For a period of several years, there were
                    arguments between AID and the Burmese Government about where the alignment was
                    supposed to go, what kind of highway it was supposed to be. The American side
                    didn't want to just say, “Well, let's just forget the whole thing.” AID would
                    have liked to have done that, but the United States had made a political
                    commitment to build the highway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we want to build this highway? What was the point
                        of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I can't remember the origin-</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: I'm not sure where the idea came from. But that had been picked as a good
                    project for the Americans to do. In the end, it was the Burmese who said, “Let's
                    forget the whole thing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Just because there didn't seem to be a basis for agreeing on how wide the
                    highway should be and precisely where it should go and what the cost should be.
                    Somebody had made a political commitment of $25 or 30 million to do something in
                    Burma. We all were trying to work out something, but in the end it turned out
                    not to be possible. A typical situation where each side is nickel and diming the
                    other. In the end, the Burmese had the good grace to say, “You're very kind, but
                    no thanks.”</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WARD: There was new structure at the University of Rangoon, designed by an
                    architectural firm called Brown and Daltas - Ben Brown and Spiro Daltas - who
                    were outstanding architects. I think they're both still alive, although they've
                    split up. Ben Brown is in Cambridge, Massachusetts now, I think. He must be
                    quite old. But it was rather interesting. They had done work in Iran before. Ben
                    Brown, who was a very gracious southern gentleman, had married a lovely Iranian
                    woman. They had designed and built a little palace for an Iranian princess. The
                    point that was driven home to them by the Iranians (This was, of course, during
                    the time of the Shah, the late 1950s.) was that they had done a very good job of
                    architectural research and drawn on the extremely rich Iranian architectural
                    tradition to produce this new structure with modern materials, but a lot of
                    traditional design themes. The Iranian clients loved it. They said, “Our problem
                    is that so many of these young Iranian architects either take their training in
                    Europe and are trying to imitate European architects and it's not Iranian.” You
                    foreigners have given us really good modern Iranian architecture.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Too many artists and architects in developing countries try to imitate
                    European themes and become derivative imitators rather than drawing on their own
                    traditions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was involved in this University of Rangoon? What
                        were they building there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: They were building some portion of the University, some new buildings,
                    which got built actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we involved with any technical assistance with the
                        University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, we were not. The Burmese did not consider it appropriate for foreigners
                    to be involved in content and what was taught. We did not provide that. We were
                    just doing a bricks and mortar job. Actually, it would be interesting to see the
                    structure now. Often in Asia you find stucco covered structures which typically
                    after five years are covered with covered with mildew and mold because of the
                    humidity and the climate. Brown and Daltas' design used enameled bricks, which
                    were far more weather-proof than stucco. They would be hard colored surfaces
                    which would not be destroyed or discolored by mildew and mold. So, they're
                    probably in great shape even now.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WARD: One part of this University construction program was the matter of
                    producing the enameled bricks. For that, they used local materials. They hired
                    an American named Sergio dello Strologo, who had studied ceramics at Alfred
                    College in New York State, and was teamed up with a partner in New York. Their
                    focus was to try to match up handicraft skills in Third World countries with
                    sophisticated markets in Europe and the United States. For example, one of our
                    projects that they were quite proud of was discovering some basket weavers in
                    some African country - I can't remember where - who were able to produce on
                    order lampshades, which went over just beautifully in some of the really posh
                    boutiques in New York, London, and Paris. They did this repeatedly. Local
                    materials and local skills adapted and used and reworked for upscale export. In
                    the long run, there were some problems with this. Very often, the popularity of
                    certain things like the native African lampshades didn't last all that long. So,
                    the markets tended to be somewhat volatile, but nevertheless, they had quite a
                    number of good successes. In Burma they had gone up country someplace near
                    Mandalay, and they had discovered some deposits of the right kind of colored
                    clays which had been used for generations to make local bricks. They had made
                    the bricks for the University locally and they had made the enamel locally and
                    they put them all together. It worked fine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. This was AID financed?</hi>

                <p>WARD: There was an AID Representative, not a full-fledged mission. The engineer
                    who oversaw both the highway and the university projects was Lou Cohen, who
                    later replaced Bill Small as AID Rep and then went on to higher things - Mission
                    Director in Botswana, I believe, among other assignments.</p>

                <p>WARD: The American Ambassador in Burma then was Henry Byroade, who among his
                    other claims to fame, happened to be the ambassador in Cairo when John Foster
                    Dulles pulled the Aswan Dam commitment away from Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1955.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WARD: I'm sorry to say that I don't remember our strategic rationale for an AID
                    presence in Burma, although I had a hand in writing the National Policy Paper on
                    the country. A political commitment had been made during the Eisenhower
                    administration. The United States did not care all that much about Burmese
                    economic development. In those days, you must recall, the American rationale for
                    economic assistance had not evolved to its present level of sophistication.
                    Monuments showing American presence and interest were important. So, there were
                    these two rather visible things, the highway, and the university. I believe
                    there was also a malaria eradication program, but it was fairly modest if I
                    recall.. In the end, there was a military coup, President U Nu was deposed and
                    General Ne Win took over. One of the first things he did was to ask the
                    Americans to leave.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WARD: There was Thailand and Indonesia. We were busy saving the economy of
                    Indonesia with economic assistance at that point. But I didn't get directly
                    involved in that. I remember in my capacity as a junior officer on the Burma and
                    miscellaneous desk, I was assigned to try to put together a package of a
                    birthday present for Western Samoa. This was under the Kennedy Administration.
                    The future of the trust territories of the Pacific was uncertain at that point.
                    The general thought in the Department of State was that the United States ought
                    to exercise its influence and expand its control in that area if that was at all
                    possible. One thing we wanted to do as gracious gesture was recognize the
                    independence of Western Samoa. As it turned out, we gave two things. We gave
                    some school buses and we gave some books for schools. There was a purchase order
                    - a PIO/C - for the list of these various books that we picked out with help
                    from the Library of Congress and the National Education Association. We put
                    together this wonderful list of books and got them all procured and sent them
                    out to Western Samoa to their school system. About six months later, we got a
                    letter of thanks back, saying, “Thanks very much, but we were wondering what you
                    expected us to do with the 1,000 dictionaries.” It turned out that one little
                    item which had escaped us all was that there was a slight typographical error
                    opposite the Webster's Dictionary on this list of books. Instead of 10, it said
                    1,000. There were supposed to be 10 because there weren't all that many schools
                    in Western Samoa. As it turned out, they somehow found a way of using the 1,000
                    dictionaries. I guess each little school in each little village got more than
                    its share and they gave a few away to some of the students. But it was all
                    because various of us, including the Assistant Burma Desk Officer, had somehow
                    failed to catch the one or two extra zeros in the PIO/C. My first major lesson
                    in AID - always read the fine print.</p>

                <p>First USAID assignment overseas in Cairo - 1965</p>
                <p>WARD: No, the next thing that happened was that the Egypt Desk Officer, John
                    Kean, recruited me to be Assistant Program Officer in Cairo. My wife and I went
                    out there in the fall of 1965.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WARD: That was rather interesting. By that time, it was the Johnson
                    Administration. The relations between the American and the Egyptian governments
                    were not particularly good. We were not ardent supporters of Nasser's Arab
                    Socialism. President Johnson had made the decision that he would try to put
                    pressure on Egypt by withholding PL 480 wheat. Egypt was highly dependent on PL
                    480 wheat to make bread for its population. I'm not sure if the idea came from
                    the White House or from the Department of State, but the thought was that by
                    withholding PL 480 wheat, one could bring Gamal Abdel Nasser to his knees. In
                    retrospect, that doesn't seem very sensible. It did not work. Gamal Abdel Nasser
                    was able to get all the wheat he needed from Spain, Australia and Argentina. It
                    just soured relations a little bit more. When Nasser broke diplomatic relations
                    with the United States in June 1967, we left under duress.</p>
                <p>We had a very small AID presence there. The AID program was run out of the
                    Economic Section of the Embassy. The Economic Counselor, a State FSO, was also
                    the AID Representative, and an AID person was the Program Officer and Assistant
                    AID Rep. When I arrived it was Ken Levick, who went on to fill a prominent role
                    in the Office of Science and Technology. He was later replaced by P. Victor
                    Morgan, Jr., a charming and very colorful person who is now living retired in
                    his hometown of San Diego, California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the program then? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We had a very small program: agriculture, irrigation. In education, there
                    was a bricks and mortar school building operation. In rural health, we were
                    building rural health centers. There was quite a bit of participant training of
                    Egyptians in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the beginning of the program then? Had it been
                        going on for some time before that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I don't know when the program started. It must have been sometime after the
                    1952 Nasser revolution. But I don't know what year it started. It was of minor
                    interest to the Egyptian government. It was, as I said, quite a small program.
                    At the same time, the Ford Foundation was in Egypt in force. We cooperated with
                    them on an AID population program. There was an effort to sensitize the Egyptian
                    government as much as possible and the Egyptian population to dangers of
                    overpopulation. One of the key people on the Ford Foundation side was Lenny
                    Kangas, who later went to AID and is now, I believe, with a Washington
                    consulting firm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about the beginning of the population
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WARD: Well, it was information and education at that point. I remember, they used
                    to have little trucks that would go around to villages with movie projectors and
                    show films on walls. I never saw any of the films actually, but they were
                    supposed to indicate the dangers of having too many children and how you can
                    avoid that. I have no idea whether they worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the government supporting it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, it was. The government was supporting it. It gradually made some
                    progress, I think. However, things were pretty well stopped at the time of the
                    June war in 1967 when we and the Ford Foundation both left so early. The reason
                    that Gamal Abdel Nasser broke diplomatic relations with the United States at
                    that point was that during the Six Day War, the United States had an
                    intelligence gathering ship anchored off Alexandria and we were feeding various
                    kinds of military intelligence to the Israelis, which assisted them in military
                    operations against Egypt. As soon as the Egyptians found that out, naturally,
                    all hell broke loose.</p>
                <p>Storm clouds had been building for some time, though. Gamal Abdel Nasser was
                    tightening screws on Israel when he closed the Gulf of Aqaba, which goes up the
                    east side of Sinai to the port of Aqaba in Jordan and, a few kilometers away,
                    the port of Elat in Israel. There was a United Nations force between the
                    Egyptian army and the Israel army which was removed and that placed the Egyptian
                    troops and Israeli troops in direct contact. So things were clearly headed for
                    confrontation. A decision had to be made in late May as to whether the embassy
                    would evacuate women and children or not. The ambassador was Richard Nolte, who
                    was not a career diplomat. He was a Middle Eastern expert, an academic. I
                    remember, at one country team meeting, he went around the table about the third
                    week in May to ask his senior staff whether or not they should evacuate the
                    dependents. There was the military attach�, the naval attach�, the economic
                    counselor, the CIA station chief. They all said, “Oh, things are okay. You don't
                    want to offend the government by doing this prematurely.” He got around to the
                    political counselor, who was Dick Parker, one of the State Department's
                    outstanding Arabists in the last few decades. He said, “Well, I don't know about
                    you guys, but I'm scared to death.” Dick told me this afterwards. He went on to
                    explain all of the reasons why he thought that it would be foolhardy not to
                    evacuate the dependents, one of which would be, by the time you were certain
                    that it was necessary, you wouldn't be able to reach the airport. So, his
                    judgment ruled and everybody else changed their minds. The dependents were flown
                    out to Athens. As it turned out, I think it was not more than two weeks later,
                    the non-essential people at the embassy (This would have been early June.) were
                    taken down to Alexandria by train at night. I was on the train. We could see the
                    Israel bombs going off to the east, lighting up the sky. We were wondering if
                    they were going to hit the railway or not. As it turned out, they did not. We
                    got to Alexandria and were put under house arrest for four days in the Palestine
                    Hotel at the east end of Alexandria, which happened to be the same hotel at
                    which Henry Kissinger would stay with his entourage when he was carrying out his
                    famous shuttle diplomacy years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you under house arrest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were detained until transport could be arranged to evacuate us up to
                    Greece. It was the correct performance of the Egyptian police which protected
                    the Americans from being attacked by a mob. Hysteria was high. Demonstrators
                    invaded the American Consulate in Alexandria and the Consular staff took refuge
                    in the vault upstairs. They were informed by radio that the mob was beginning to
                    set fire to the Consulate downstairs. One of the more courageous officials went
                    downstairs to try to defuse the situation. The leader of the Egyptians politely
                    asked to borrow the American's cigarette lighter so he could burn the American
                    flag which he had just taken down. The American gave it to him, naturally, but
                    was not harmed. It must have been much more exciting for the Consular people
                    than it was for us out at the Palestine Hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Egyptians were protecting you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, they were behaving quite correctly. We were confined to the grounds of
                    the Palestine Hotel, which was very close, a few hundred yards, to one of King
                    Farouk's palaces at the east end of Alexandria.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile our naval attach� was desperately trying to make arrangements to get us
                    transportation up to Athens. It turned out, after four days, he was able to
                    organize a Greek passenger ship escorted by an American destroyer. So they came
                    down and we went through customs examination. The Egyptian police behaved very
                    correctly. By that time, the Spanish embassy had agreed to be our
                    representatives in Cairo since direct diplomatic relations no longer
                    existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all of the embassy staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, there were still some essential people who finally came down from Cairo
                    the fourth day. This was my colleague and supervisor, Vic Morgan, who had been
                    working away with the AID controller, Bernie Riedel, following the handbook and
                    methodically doing what you're supposed to do in the handbook to close down an
                    AID mission. By the book. It was a little program. So, they managed to do that.
                    Unfortunately, we had one casualty. There was one young man who was on the
                    controller's staff who had a bleeding ulcer. He had been prevented by the
                    Egyptians from getting medical treatment and he died in the last day after he
                    got to Alexandria. After we all, including the essential staff, had gotten on
                    the Greek ship and gotten ourselves up to Athens, one of the saddest duties of
                    the Acting AID Director, Vic Morgan, was to meet the wife of this young man, who
                    was pregnant at the time, and say, “Unfortunately, your husband has died.” It
                    was a very painful thing to do. In any case, with that one exception, everybody
                    got out.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We spent a very pleasant month in Athens. One thing Vic Morgan and I did was
                    write a nice long airgram. There were such things as airgrams in those days,
                    carried to Washington by plane and reproduced on mimeograph machines.
                    Precomputer technology. We wrote an airgram giving a summary of what the program
                    had done and what our recommendations would be about how you ought to open up a
                    program if you ever want to do that in Egypt again. We were quite proud of that.
                    We thought it was a good job, showing very perceptive knowledge of the terrain.
                    Of course, I never in my entire AID career afterwards, after we opened up the
                    current massive AID program, I never once found anybody who had ever read
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they may have. Was there any special message you
                        were trying to convey? What was the content of this message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I've forgotten. I don't remember what we said. I know it was brilliant, but
                    I don't remember what we said. It may very well have been irrelevant to the
                    massive program with which we went back under Anwar Sadat. I mentioned earlier
                    that we were collaborating with the Ford Foundation on a population program. The
                    Ford Foundation was doing other things. One thing that they were doing was a
                    regional development program in upper Egypt, centered on Luxor and Aswan. This
                    was an ambitious program which involved education, school building, health,
                    public administration, agriculture, irrigation, the works. I don't know how much
                    money was put into it, but it was a lot more than the American aid program. When
                    I went back to Egypt in my last assignment, I never found anybody who had heard
                    about that. But Ford had been there several years during the early to mid-60s.
                    They had accomplished something. There certainly was a tremendous amount of
                    planning. It would be interesting for someone to dig back into the Ford
                    Foundation files and find out whatever happened to that and how much, if any,
                    was actually used by successor aid groups, the Americans or others, or indeed
                    the Egyptian government, during the '70s and '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there must have been some elements like the

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, I think that's true.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: As the Assistant Program Officer, I worked with the various technical
                    divisions to try to help them package their products and fit them into one
                    seamless whole.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't go back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, I did not. In summer 1967, after our month in Athens, I was assigned to
                    Pakistan and in a few weeks we were in Lahore.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>In Egypt I had come to have great admiration for my supervisor and colleague, Vic
                    Morgan. He negotiated an assignment as the Deputy Director in Indonesia at that
                    point. He was an interesting person. He was one of a generation of people who
                    had joined the foreign aid program in Europe somewhat after the Second World
                    War. There were others who had done this - Walter Furst was one. He was the
                    Assistant Director for Program in Pakistan at the time that I was there. He had
                    been in the American Military Government in Berlin after the Second World War.
                    He had then joined USRO in Paris. That must have been at the time of the Point
                    IV program which began under President Truman. They had an office in Paris. You
                    had this generation of people who had, for one reason or another, been in Europe
                    and decided that they were going to get a job in what sounded like an
                    interesting part of American government efforts. So, Walter showed up there. Vic
                    Morgan was in Paris going to the Sorbonne and was in the process of writing a
                    biography of Gertrude Stein. He never finished it. There was Gordon Ramsey, who
                    was studying classical music at that time with Nadia Boulanger and Madame Claude
                    Delius, widow of one of France's major modern composers. He too went down and
                    got a job at USRO. You had this whole group of people. They're now either dead
                    or very old. But these people were among the first of the foreign aid group who
                    for a long time left their stamp on ICA and AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Transfer to USAID/Pakistan - 1967</p>
                <p>WARD: That was in mid-1967. The Pakistan AID group at that time had just moved
                    from Karachi to Lahore. Lahore was not the capital. We had a Consulate there.
                    The capital at that point was Rawalpindi. Just up the road a couple of miles
                    from Rawalpindi, the present capital of Islamabad was being built. So, for the
                    first couple of years, we stayed in Lahore and then we moved up to
                    Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the country then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Oh, very good. We had excellent relations with the Pakistan government. Our
                    AID Mission Director was Bill Kontos, who later became an ambassador. His Deputy
                    was Ernie Stern, who was one of the group of people who resigned from AID in
                    protest in 1971 over the rather brutal treatment by the West Pakistanis of the
                    East Pakistanis when they invaded what is now Bangladesh. But there were some
                    very talented people there. The Harvard Advisory Group was in force there. They
                    were working very closely with the Pakistan Government Planning Commission,
                    headed by a gentleman named Mabub ul-Haq, a notable in the development
                    community. The Harvard Group were working with the Pakistan government on policy
                    questions, import stabilization, and irrigation.</p>

                <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the program just about the time that Bill
                    Kontos and Ernie Stern left in 1969 was that they were replaced by Joe Wheeler,
                    who came as the Director, and Vincent Brown, his Deputy Director. The Green
                    Revolution was taking place, just beginning at that point, with the new high
                    yielding varieties of wheat being introduced into West Pakistan. I remember very
                    clearly the first harvest. Our agriculture advisor was a Texan named Curry
                    Brookshire. He was great. He had a friend down in Mexico named Norman Borlaug at
                    CYMMT - the Rockefeller Foundation-funded wheat research institute. That was the
                    place where the new high yielding varieties of wheat were being researched and
                    produced in Mexico. Somehow or other, Curry worked it out so that 10 tons of
                    seed were brought in by plane to West Pakistan and there were a handful of
                    rather wealthy landowners in West Pakistan who had agreed to cooperate with the
                    agricultural practices which the Americans were suggesting (fertilizer, high
                    yielding varieties, and irrigation). The first year, we were all very lucky
                    because the rains were good. If the rains hadn't been good, the first year's
                    harvest wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as it was. But naturally, we
                    said, “The reason the harvest is good is because of the high yielding variety.”
                    Everybody believed it. At least, a lot of people believed it. It was partly
                    true. But that helped to encourage more farmers the following year to plant the
                    high yielding variety. That was where it took off. It was a highly informal
                    arrangement, just that 10 tons and a few enterprising Americans and a few of the
                    Pakistani landowners who were willing to take some risks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this go down to the small farmers then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, it did. It worked fine. It was very interesting to watch that. Then,
                    with the relative beginning success for the Green Revolution in wheat, Joe
                    Wheeler, ever ambitious and optimistic, thought he would try the same thing in
                    East Pakistan with rice from the International Rice Research Institute in Los
                    Banos in the Philippines. The progress with better varieties of rice was not as
                    good or as far advanced as the progress at that time with the wheat. But
                    nevertheless, a combination of proper farming methods and good rice and
                    fertilizer has since then made a big difference in rice production all through
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We provided the fertilizer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. That certainly helped. It didn't move as fast as the Green Revolution
                    in West Pakistani wheat, but I remember hearing Joe Wheeler say one time, “I
                    think the most practical, the most concrete contribution that people like us can
                    make is to set goals, to set objectives, so as to focus the energy of a lot of
                    people on getting some things done.” Well, it worked. In the last couple of
                    decades, there has, in fact, been a lot of progress in Bangladesh with massive
                    inputs of fertilizer, better rice. A few years ago, I happened to go out to
                    Bangladesh and they had a rice surplus that year. It was very good. That was one
                    of the things that, I suppose, started back in the late 1960s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any institutional work going along with this in
                        terms of developing the Agricultural Extension Service or the research
                        program or any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, absolutely. Also, there was major attention to the development of tube
                    wells for getting water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what we were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The importance of water in the Punjab, of course, cannot be overestimated.
                    During early 60s, the World Bank had put a great deal of money into the
                    mobilization or directing or damming of the five rivers which irrigate the
                    Punjab. There was a major political problem when India and Pakistan broke up:
                    India controlled the waters of the Punjab. To be able to avoid having the
                    Pakistani Punjab go up in smoke during the summer, it was necessary to perform
                    some surgery on some of the rivers. So, there was this great international
                    agreement which was reached. With the help of World Bank funding, the waters
                    were so controlled that the Indians and the Pakistanis were able to agree on how
                    the waters would be distributed. So, that was one thing that brought water to
                    their otherwise relatively fertile Punjab. In addition to that, to help expand
                    the area in which the wheat and other things could be grown, the idea of
                    bringing up subterranean water with tube wells, ulectrically or motor-driven
                    tube wells, was used. That caused some problems because the water would come up,
                    but there were minerals in the water. After a few seasons, you would begin to
                    see around the outer edges of the cultivated areas, white mineral deposits which
                    made the land uncultivable. So, at the time I left Pakistan in 1971, there was
                    serious concern about how to deal with desalinization. I honestly don't remember
                    whether that problem was solved. I remember, by 1971, there was almost as much
                    land being lost to cultivation each year as there was being put under new
                    cultivation, thanks to the tube wells. So, that was a problem. Our engineers
                    didn't really know how to deal with that. There was talk about trying to figure
                    out ways of flushing it. It would be interesting to go back and just find out in
                    retrospect what was, in fact, done, and whether that was really the right
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The thing which, however, was looming ahead of us was, in 1970 and '71, had
                    nothing to do with high yielding wheat or rice or tube wells. It was the breakup
                    of Pakistan. In 1970, there was a very bad cyclone disaster, a tidal wave on the
                    Bay of Bengal. Lots of people were killed. Crops were ruined. It was not unique.
                    This had happened, I'm sure, hundreds of times before, but this was a
                    particularly bad one. It seemed to bring other discontents to a head. Up until
                    then, for example, the Bengalis had generally felt that they were being badly
                    treated by the Punjabis. They were both Muslims. That was why they were both
                    part of Pakistan. But these two places were separated by a very large expanse of
                    India. They were quite different. Various expert foreign advisors such as those
                    on the Harvard Advisory Group, were telling the Pakistan government that what
                    they should do is take all of the foreign exchange, or a large portion of the
                    foreign exchange which was earned by the export sale of Bengali jute, and invest
                    it in West Pakistan. The money, the resources, would be more efficiently used.
                    That was fine from the point of view of the Punjabis, but from the point of view
                    of the Bengalis, it looked like imperialist exploitation. So, there was a lot of
                    discontent about the relatively heavy-handed way in which the Punjabis were
                    running the country. That was just one example of a number of ways in which the
                    people from Islamabad were throwing their weight around in Dacca. At that point,
                    we had a provincial mission in Dacca. We had a provincial mission in Lahore. We
                    did not have, as I believe there is now, a provincial mission in Peshawar. The
                    Director of the provincial mission in Dacca was none other than Eric Griffel,
                    now retired from AID. He later served as Assistant Director in USAID/Morocco
                    while I was there as Program Officer. When he retired he spent several years as
                    proprietor of the Apple Tree Bookshop in Concord, New Hampshire. I understand he
                    has now moved back to Washington (T: (301) 656 1895). In Pakistan Eric would
                    come to meetings in Islamabad and repeatedly say, “We have the same problem
                    inside the mission that the Pakistan government does. You people aren't paying
                    attention enough to our problems in Bengal.” He did it in such a charming and
                    puckish way that he never got people angry at him. But his point was quite
                    serious. There was insufficient priority being given to the far poorer
                    population of Bengal by the Pakistan government in Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it's also true for the AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I think so. We tried to do better, but the allocation of funds was not
                    balanced. In Eric's view, more talent and resources on the American side should
                    have been poured into Bengal. I don't know. I was prepared to believe it. In any
                    case, there were a variety of discontents and political opposition seemed to be
                    strengthening. There was a mixture of fundamentalist Islam, resentment against
                    West Pakistani exploitation - not terrorism - but an articulate political
                    opposition. The cyclone disaster was perhaps the straw that just drove everybody
                    over the edge. There was a question as to what role India was going to play. If
                    I try to make a statement now about the nuances of what happened there, it's
                    going to be wrong. In any case, there was a lot of discontent.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: In the end, the Pakistani army felt that it was necessary to invade Bengal,
                    which they did. They shot the opposition leaders. There is to this day a
                    monument just outside of Dacca to these martyrs. That led very directly to the
                    breakup of Pakistan. I left before that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other programs that were going on at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Actually, one of the things that I appreciated very much was the
                    intellectual inspiration provided by Joe Wheeler. About once a year, we would
                    have a retreat up in Nathiagali, a former British hill station about an hour's
                    drive north from Islamabad. The Ford Foundation had a compound up there which
                    they were kind enough to let us use. Joe would usually bring various people,
                    thinkers in the development community. There was Jim Grant, one of U.S. foreign
                    aid's pioneers who by that time was running the Overseas Development Council in
                    Washington. There was John Lewis, director of the AID mission in New Delhi.
                    There were various other people who would come in and talk to us. Basically, it
                    was like college seminars. They would be just wonderful. We would all contribute
                    our papers and take part in discussions. We would have some of the Harvard
                    Advisory Group, irrigation experts, talking about their researches on what
                    really would hold promise for Pakistan and India on the irrigation front. Wally
                    Falcon and Carl Gotsch were the two people in the world, I think, who had
                    collected the most data and knew the most about the dynamics of irrigation in
                    Pakistan. So, there was a lot of attraction in just being encouraged to think
                    about how you ought to deal with this business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the substantive lines of thinking
                        that were being presented or discussed, the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were just taking a good look at how we could try to replicate the
                    lessons of the great Green Revolution for one, and what role there might be for
                    how you would try to move a population program ahead, for example. This was just
                    at the beginning of the period when Jim Grant was preaching about barefoot
                    doctors and how to apply basic medical practices affordably out there at the
                    grass roots, how you could get people to train up a group of people who wouldn't
                    be doctors who would always go to the capital, but paramedicals, midwives and
                    nurse-midwives, who could go out there and actually make a difference at the
                    grass roots. So, we were trying to figure out whether there was something we
                    could do to add our little extra push to something which the local government
                    might be interested in or encouraged to be interested enough to do. Mabub ul-Haq
                    was in the Pakistani Planning Commission then. But he was clearly one of the
                    movers and shakers. It was a time during which John Lewis in New Delhi and Joe
                    Wheeler in Pakistan were trying to work out some realistic approaches to
                    economic development.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a discussion of policy reform at that point, or
                        was that to come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I think that came later. It was perhaps taking shape in the discussions our
                    senior people - including our Chief Economist, Evelyn Ripps - had with the
                    Harvard Advisory Group and the Planning Commission and the Finance Ministry. I
                    was concerned more with seeing that the technical assistance projects worked,
                    and I wasn't involved in policy discussions for the most part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other topics that you remember discussing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No. I remember, however, that after leaving Pakistan to spend a year at the
                    Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, the dean there was the same John Lewis who
                    had led the American aid program in India - seen then as the free world's answer
                    to Mao's forced march into development. While he was running the AID mission in
                    New Delhi he had reared a group of young disciples among his junior officers.
                    Later, some of them said, “Well, working with John was like having a never
                    ending seminar on development. It was just wonderful, all of the things that we
                    learned.” Once in a while, one or another of his disciples would show up in
                    Islamabad. In fact, when Walter Furst, the Assistant Director for Program left,
                    he was replaced by David Mathiasen, who had spent time working for John Lewis in
                    New Delhi. And Evelyn Ripps, who guided the economic policy dialogue. She had a
                    team of two or three bright young economists who were working very closely with
                    the Harvard Advisory Group people to try to develop policy oriented suggestions
                    for the Pakistanis or rather with the Pakistanis. This was very much a dialogue
                    of equals. There were some very sophisticated people. I mean, Mabub ul-Haq was
                    only one of them. So, there was a very collegial atmosphere among the
                    development community, both Pakistani and American. Something of the same, John
                    Lewis brought to Princeton. Those who were interested in any aspect of
                    international economic development had a wonderful time in his discussions at
                    the Woodrow Wilson School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was sort of a high point of AID's role in development
                        in Pakistan. What do you think was the real impact of all the work that was

                </p>
                <p>WARD: I think so, yes. Probably on the grain production front more than anything
                    else. The policy level aspects, I didn't deal with that directly, but I have the
                    impression that this collaborative way of analyzing problems and trying to
                    figure out how to deal with them in which you had the Pakistanis in the Planning
                    Commission and the Americans in the Harvard Advisory Group and the AID Mission
                    working together basically as a team, I think that worked pretty well.</p>

                    Bank.</p>

                <p>WARD: I think I've pretty much touched on everything that I can say about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about irrigation. What other sectors were we
                        in? Were we working in other areas? We had a commodity import program, I
                        suppose, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right, we certainly did. Under the Commodity Import Program, we
                    brought in a lot of the fertilizer. There was a lot of discussion about domestic
                    pricing of fertilizer to make sure that it got distributed as widely as
                    possible. You would get all kinds of interesting arguments about whether or not
                    you ought to do things to discourage smuggling and black marketeering. Most of
                    the economists would say “No, let it go. The market is telling you where this
                    stuff should go.” A person that really would have some useful things to say
                    about this whole aspect of things, I expect, in the absence of the late Evelyn
                    Ripps, would be Walter Furst (T: (202) 244 0672). Perhaps you have done
                    that.</p>

                        were there four years. That was a very important period. What was your job?
                        What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was the Program Officer.</p>

                <p>WARD: By current standards, probably not all that great. The Commodity Import
                    Program was loan-financed, but we had a substantial grant program for the time.
                    At that point, we were quite deeply involved in local currency programming,
                    which has always had its detractors and its disciples. What can you possibly
                    accomplish with local currency programming that actually has an influence on
                    resource allocation? There have been books written about that. But we would have
                    our little discussions about local currency programming. I don't think it made
                    much difference in resource allocation, but it allowed us to associate the AID
                    program with successful development expenditures in the Pakistani budget.</p>

                <p>WARD: After four years there, I spent a year at the Woodrow Wilson School at
                    Princeton.</p>
                <p>A sabbatical at Princeton - 1971-1972</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right. I think that that's something which AID should never lose
                    sight of. It's important and useful to send people off so that they can spend a
                    certain among of time stepping back and reexamining their experience and looking
                    at what they can learn from not only what they've been through, but from talking
                    with other people with similar interests.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WARD: Being a Princeton fellow gives you complete freedom to do whatever you
                    want. I remember David Korn, a political officer from the Department of State
                    who had just come back from an assignment in Israel. He spent the year writing a
                    book about Middle Eastern politics. I just took courses. I took a great course
                    with James Billington, who is now with the Library of Congress, who was a
                    well-known Russian historian and Kremlinologist. He gave a course on revolution
                    and politics, not only in Russia, but elsewhere. I took a seminar with John
                    Lewis in which we dealt with various development questions. One of my colleagues
                    up there was a person named Richard Arndt, who had been with USIA in Iran during
                    the time of the Shah. We wrote a paper, I remember, on the cultural dimensions
                    of economic development, or how economic development and culture did or did not
                    work together. I note that these days, culture and development have now become a
                    fad. I was watching a tape the other day of a speech by Ismail Serageldin of the
                    World Bank on culture and development. During the period that I was in AID, I
                    think the attitude of AID regarding culture and development was very much like
                    the attitude of Hermann Goering, who said, “When I hear the word 'culture,' I
                    reach for my gun.” I remember, Larry Harrison, who spent his AID career in the
                    Latin America Bureau, wrote a book a number of years ago on this theme which was
                    roundly criticized by many of the economists, who believe that culture has very
                    little to do with economic development. You can't measure it. It's not
                    quantifiable. So, to hell with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking about it at that time? You say that
                        the AID didn't have much sensitivity to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: During this period, Dick Arndt and I pretty much agreed that, if you could
                    ever figure out how to deal with the cultural assumptions and the ways of
                    thinking, the ways of behaving, that anything society puts into the minds of its
                    people can have an important effect on how they will behave economically.
                    Although we certainly didn't come out of our discussions with any formulas or
                    very many operational suggestions, we certainly thought that ways needed to be
                    found to bring this dimension into development thinking. I'm glad to see that in
                    recent years there has been some effort to do that. Maybe someday we'll get
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of AID's development policy or strategy
                        at that time? What was defining AID's program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WARD: AID was going through several different evolutions. About the time that I
                    appeared in 1961, AID believed in resource transfer. We were putting lots of
                    money into economies for major infrastructure projects. We were not very much
                    concerned with dealing with basic human needs directly. We thought that somehow
                    by pouring the resources into the economy, that would lead indirectly to dealing
                    with basic human needs. After a while, as AID budgets went down and as different
                    theories of what would work in AID came to the fore we did shift to basic human
                    needs. Each approach had some element of realism and at least one Achilles heel.
                    I'm sure that a far more theoretically sophisticated analysis and critique can
                    be made of every single one of AID's stages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we come to that towards the end? Did you write a
                        paper at Woodrow Wilson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you write about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Dick and I collaborated on this culture and AID business. It was a
                    relatively brief paper. It was not a major thesis. It was just in one of the
                    courses. But I found it a very helpful and fruitful period simply to be allowed
                    the time to do some broader thinking not only about development, but about a
                    variety of other things which I found helped me very much in my later work in
                    thinking in more general policy oriented terms. So, that was a good year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after the end of the year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return to USAID/Washington in theProgram and Policy Coordination Bureau -
                    1972</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WARD: In the summer of 1972 I went back to Washington for a few years. I went to
                    work with the late John Kaufmann and his deputy Art Handley in an office which
                    was just being created called the Office of Program Development and Project
                    Review in PPC. This was an effort to try to use the project evaluation and
                    approval process to transfer lessons from one part of the agency to another. One
                    of the things that was given a certain amount of attention was the Latin America
                    Bureau's experience with sector lending, which none of the other bureaus really
                    knew very much about. So, we were all looking to the Latin America Bureau to
                    teach us how to do sector lending correctly. As it turned out, the more you
                    probed, the more you realized that there were a number of different kinds of
                    sector lending, some of which worked and some of which did not. Depending on a
                    number of other factors like the personalities of the people you were dealing
                    with, you could convince them to make certain policy changes if you gave them
                    enough money to put enough resources in. Sometimes, you could and sometimes you
                    couldn't. Sometimes sector lending was not so different from local currency
                    programming, of which I had had a taste in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense of what were the principal features
                        of what worked and didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I'm afraid not. But I know that this matter of looking at specific projects
                    in one region and then trying to distill a few lessons which can be then applied
                    in other regions, was a good thing to do. It's not clear, it's probably
                    impossible to tell just how far the actual transfer went, but at least various
                    things were flagged. People's attention was directed at the desirability of
                    paying attention to what was going on in one regional bureau and trying to see
                    whether or not you might be able to apply that in other regional bureaus. I have
                    no idea in the end how much actually happened. A lot of the time, we had a sense
                    in that little office that we were kind of spinning our wheels because some of
                    the regional bureau people, generally speaking, considered it arrogance on the
                    part of these Policy and Program Coordination people to try to tell them what to
                    do. After all, the only people who really know the realities of what will work
                    in Region X are the people in that regional bureau, period. I think that view
                    may have moderated a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the lessons stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And then transferred to the NENA Bureau and programs in Europe - 1974</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WARD: Nothing that I remember. I went on to something else at that point. I went
                    on to rather more operational things. In 1974, I spent three years in the Office
                    of Near East and North African Affairs. I was not dealing with Morocco or
                    Tunisia, where we still had a program, but I was dealing with Portugal, Cyprus,
                    Turkey and Malta. Portugal was interesting. Portugal was a lesson in how to
                    invent an AID program and set up a mission almost overnight. This was during the
                    period when, if you remember, Eurocommunism was perceived as a danger. It was
                    particularly perceived as a danger by Henry Kissinger. He looked at the map and
                    said, “ The communists are in a position of serious power in Spain. The
                    Communist Party in Portugal is large. What would happen if the communists took
                    over in Portugal?” There was a Portuguese revolution in 1974. It was truly
                    amazing. There were about three political parties to the left of the Stalinists.
                    There was some Maoist group and there was some other independent little
                    communist group. Then there were the Socialists who were comparatively middle of
                    the road. Mario Soares, was the leader of the Socialists. I suppose the
                    geopolitical nightmare that occurred to Dr. Kissinger was the possibility that
                    pro-Soviet governments could control the Straits of Gibraltar. In any case, the
                    decision was made to start a program in Portugal. This was a time when large
                    numbers of Portuguese were coming back from the two Portuguese colonies of
                    Mozambique and Angola, the retornados. The number of people who were coming back
                    from the colonies into that little country of Portugal were a larger a
                    percentage of the population than all of the influx of people from Eastern
                    Europe into Central Europe at the end of the Second World War. So there appeared
                    to be the potential for a lot of social dislocation which could have turned into
                    political problems. In any case, we set up a program composed of PL 480 and
                    housing investment guarantees and grants and loans. We sent a couple of people
                    over. I remember, Eric Griffel was one of them. The Program Officer in the Near
                    East Bureau at that time was Glen Patterson, who just happened to have gone to
                    the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and spoke fluent Portuguese. Various
                    people were asked to put together the program. So, the program was invented.
                    Glen was asked to go over and set up a mission. This was at a time when Frank
                    Carlucci was the ambassador. He had a very talented group of young handpicked
                    Portuguese-speaking political officers, many of whom had worked with him during
                    his assignment as a political officer in Brazil. They all spoke Portuguese and
                    they would go out and hang around the various all night meetings that the
                    various revolutionary groups would hold in military camps and stadiums in and
                    around Lisbon. They would come back in the early hours of the morning and write
                    their dispatches back to Washington. That revolution was analyzed with far more
                    sophistication than many things of equal importance before or since.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The AID program was interesting. The people we were dealing with were often very
                    well trained, serious professional people. I was commuting fairly often between
                    Washington and Lisbon. We would go into some discussion with some of these
                    really left wing, anti-American communists with their cigarettes and black
                    leather jackets. The first part of the meeting would be vehement attacks on the
                    evils of capitalism in general and American imperialism in particular. We would
                    then start to talk about the specifics of, say, a housing project for Portuguese
                    workers. Immediately, the atmosphere became more friendly. They had gotten their
                    ideological pitch out of the way and we got down to work. It was surprising to
                    see, when we got down to practical operational things, how much we could really
                    agree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was housing picked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Because they wanted to do something visible for the workers. It was stated
                    to be very important. There was a problem about that. Some of the more
                    politically and less economically inclined Portuguese said, “We don't care what
                    it costs. We want to do well by the Portuguese working man.” Peter Kimm was the
                    Director of the Housing Office in AID/Washington at that point. Peter Kimm and
                    various of his colleagues would try to explain that cost is something you need
                    to pay attention to or you're going to go broke in the long run. It was very
                    difficult for them to accept this. In the end, they didn't ever completely
                    accept it. They were willing to agree on some realistically conceived housing
                    projects, but they disagreed on others. They simply didn't want to accept what
                    the AID people insisted on as financially viable, like sites and services. Sites
                    and services isn't good enough, they said. You've got to have higher quality low
                    cost housing for Portuguese workers. But it was refreshing to deal with people
                    of the professional seriousness that we found there. Although there is no longer
                    a Portuguese program, there is something called the Luso-American Institute. I
                    think Glen Patterson may very well have something to do with that even now. At
                    least, he did for a time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other programs we were pushing at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were doing something in agriculture. PL 480 food. Regional planning. I
                    discovered during that period that there were regional planning institutions in
                    the United States. There was the Appalachian Regional Planning Commission. There
                    were regional planning commissions for New England. So, we got various people
                    who were regional planners or community planners, city planners, to come to
                    Portugal and talk with their counterparts or try to establish such regional
                    planning institutions. I don't know what finally happened, but that was an
                    effort to make contact. One of the most useful things the aid program did, I
                    think, was to help the Portuguese establish contact with American and European
                    experts whose talents they could use and learn from, and send Portuguese
                    students to relevant kinds of training in the United States.</p>

                        helped set up? Was that part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We tried to help strengthen the planning capacity of provincial
                    governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the PL 480 program, was this Title I or was this Title
                        II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Title II program for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Title II was food relief for people, the retornados, who were coming back
                    from the colonies. It was rather interesting to see the attitudes within
                    Portuguese society. Apparently, the people who had tended to go off to the
                    colonies were people who felt constricted by that little country and wanted to
                    go off the way Americans on the East Coast would go out West in the 19th
                    century. These people went to the colonies. Very often, they were very
                    enterprising people. Some of them really wanted to stay. Some I talked to said,
                    “We got along just fine with our African counterparts. We would have dearly
                    loved to stay and work closely with our African counterparts, but politics
                    didn't permit it.” These people came back and they were among the most
                    enterprising and the least hidebound and the most open to new ideas and new
                    approaches of all the Portuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were they assimilated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WARD: Pretty well. There were no major political problems or outbursts or
                    discontent caused by these people. The conservative Portuguese institution of
                    the family and the community tended to absorb them pretty well. Portugal even to
                    this day is a relatively conservative society. They feel like a family. You go
                    into a railroad station and some little child is crying and some totally strange
                    woman will walk up to him and say, “Now, stop this. Tell me where your mother
                    is. You know you're not supposed to behave like this.” They're one big family.
                    But the one kind of interesting insight about Portugal is the great difference
                    between the north and the south, north from Lisbon and south from Lisbon, purely
                    because of geography. North from Lisbon, it's small farms. The atmosphere is one
                    of the independence of small farmers. South from Lisbon, it's the feudal
                    atmosphere of large estates. It is no accident that the strongest area of the
                    communists in Portugal is the south, the downtrodden peasants being exploited in
                    their view by the large estate owners. So, the farmers to the north were able to
                    bring pressure to bear on the decision making of the central government very
                    neatly by simply blockading the one major highway just north of Lisbon through
                    which all of the food and produce for the Lisbon markets would come from the
                    farms. It took about three days before the revolutionary government said, “Maybe
                    we'd better just keep our hands off the people in the north.” It was very neatly
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we involved at all in assisting with the
                        assimilation? You mentioned Title II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were, I think. At the same time that I was on the Portugal Desk in the
                    Near East Bureau, I worked very closely with Bob Chamberlain in the Africa
                    Bureau, the desk officer for Angola and Mozambique. I'm not sure what we were
                    doing there, but I know that we certainly kept in very close touch on what the
                    retornados were doing, what kinds of things we ought to do, at least on the
                    Portuguese end, to help them. I'm not sure what was happening at the other end.
                    I think we did help with some of the actual repatriation. I think there was some
                    shipping that we arranged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Title II food, was that distributed through the
                        government or through NGOs? How was it handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The government and some NGOs. I think the Portuguese Red Cross was
                    involved. I'm not sure which others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was available to the people while they got
                        settled, was that the idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. That was a totally un-AID-like program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember how large the program was at the
                        beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WARD: No, I do not. I know Robert Nooter, who was the Assistant Administrator for
                    the Near East Bureau at the time, found that he wanted to make the program
                    appear as large as possible for purposes of impressing the Portuguese government
                    and also the United States Congress. So, we managed to add up the amount that we
                    would be giving for the next five years, including housing investment guarantees
                    - not just the fact that there would be investments, but actually the amounts
                    that would be guaranteed, which, of course, are not United States Government
                    expenditures. Nevertheless, we added them in anyway. It sounded pretty good. I
                    don't remember what the total was. We got it all on one sheet of paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the investment guarantees were private capital, I
                        guess, by and large through private contractors and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in other countries during that time
                        while you were in that position? Your position was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I got involved briefly in Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta. AID had provided Malta
                    with some Army surplus ships which we had to follow up and monitor. Cyprus was
                    another rather strange phenomenon. The same year, 1974, the Portuguese
                    revolution took place, the Turks invaded Cyprus and took over the northern part
                    of the island. Most of the Turks went up there and most of the Greek Cypriots
                    who had lived in the north were evacuated to the south. So, the International
                    Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN High Commission for Refugees
                    (UNHCR) were both in there trying to help refugees locate each other, trying to
                    help refugees resettle. There had been a major movement of people, the Turks to
                    the north and the Greeks to the south. The Greek Cypriots were still housed in
                    large warehouses with little screens or pieces of plywood set up between where
                    each little family group was. In areas perhaps four meters square there would be
                    sometimes four or five people taking turns sleeping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were providing food relief. We were trying to encourage employment for
                    the refugees. I remember in one little project we were trying to encourage
                    handicraft development to create jobs, trying to encourage exports of Cypriot
                    handicrafts such as lace, which apparently is a big seller in Europe and
                    England. We had one AID person there: Bruno Kosheleff, who worked very closely
                    with the ambassador. That was the entire AID staff - just one person.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much money were we providing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Not very much. It was more symbolic than anything else. Turkey was
                    different. While we were gradually phasing down our Turkey program, there had
                    been a major program there for a number of years. We had one effort to encourage
                    farmers to grow crops other than opium poppies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to promote?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were suggesting fruits and vegetables. So far as I know, program like
                    that haven't worked all that well because you can make so much more money
                    growing opium poppies. There may be some places where they work, but I don't
                    think Turkey was one of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were closing the mission then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The mission still had probably 20 or 25 people. I think during the next
                    couple of years, they were closing down. It was not a major program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on the desk. I see. Any other aspect of
                        that job? How did you find working in that bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I reported to Tony Schwarzwalder during that period. Tony was an energetic
                    and resourceful manager. He had been in the Pakistan mission - one of Joe
                    Wheeler's disciples. The small world of the development community.</p>
                <p>New overseas assignment in Morocco - 1977</p>
                <p>So after three years there, I went off to Morocco for four years, where I was the
                    Program Officer, first under Al Disdier as the AID Mission Director, his first
                    and last overseas post. He was then succeeded by Hal Fleming, whose Deputy
                    Director was first Eric Griffel, then Harry Petrequin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Morocco at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: In Morocco, we had a fairly limited program which involved heavy emphasis
                    on dry land agriculture. I'm not sure if this was at the beginning, the middle,
                    or the end of the basic human needs period.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: 1977/78.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of mid-way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were very much concerned that 80% of the peasants in Morocco lived in
                    dry land agriculture areas and that was where we wanted to place our emphasis.
                    We had a major long term contract with the University of Minnesota for
                    developing an agricultural training institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Institut Agronomique Hassan II, the Hassan II Agronomic Institute. This
                    was to train agricultural extension people and trainers of agricultural
                    extension people and create an agricultural extension service. This program went
                    on for a long time before I arrived and after I left. That part of the program
                    was very good and appealed to the Moroccan government. The heavy emphasis on dry
                    land agriculture did not appeal to the Moroccan government so much. They were
                    much more interested in fruits and vegetables. Morocco produces a lot of oranges
                    and dates and grapes. They wanted to improve the cultivation of these products
                    rather than dry land wheat. Part of the reason was because larger, wealthier
                    members of society owned farms and plantations which produced these products. In
                    due course, we agreed to do what the Moroccans wanted. It was probably a good
                    decision. It was increasing one kind of agricultural production for the
                    Moroccans. In the end, I think, dry land agriculture came along okay anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing in the fruits and vegetables area with
                        our program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Toward the end of the period that I was there (1980-1981), we began to do
                    something in horticulture, to establish a horticultural institute not so far
                    from Agadir down the coast in southern Morocco. I understand that's going along
                    pretty well. We got involved in a variety of things.</p>
                <p>We had a major population program there, which seemed to be working pretty well.
                    The Moroccan government supported it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were fairly receptive to a population program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feature of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were able to distribute contraceptives rather widely in local health
                    centers. We had a mother and child health program, which encouraged women or
                    showed women how to take good care of their small children, and also
                    incidentally how to use contraceptives. It was slow, but it was making
                    progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was run through the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, it was run through the government. During 1979, if you remember, there
                    was an energy crisis. Gas prices went up in the United States and in Europe.
                    There were big lines at gas stations. Renewable energy became popular. We
                    decided that we were going to have a renewable energy program in Morocco. The
                    only problem was, nobody knew anything about renewable energy. However we had
                    the assistance of Alan Jacobs' Office of Energy in the Bureau for Science and
                    Technology. Alan Jacobs was extremely helpful. He corralled experts of various
                    kinds: wind, energy, small hydroelectric facilities, solar energy. He would send
                    these people out to help design projects. So, we managed to put together a
                    multifaceted energy project. In the end it faded as the fad of renewable energy
                    faded. It lasted three or four years. Morocco is particularly rich in wind
                    facilities. You drive down the road from Rabat to Casablanca and you can see the
                    remains or, in those days, you could see the remains of old, broken windmills
                    which had been put up by the French, but had never been repaired since Moroccan
                    independence in 1956 and therefore didn't work anymore. But the wind was there
                    and they would use it for things like pumping water.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WARD: We established a renewable energy institute in Marrakech, which is about
                    four hours drive south of Casablanca. It's a nice, warm place. That renewable
                    energy center was intended to demonstrate energy efficient methods of
                    construction as well as carry out pilot projects in wind energy, small
                    hydroelectric installations, and solar energy, both flat plate collectors to
                    warm water, and photovoltaic cells. We did that. In the end, the project wasn't
                    continued by AID because it could not be demonstrated convincingly enough that
                    the different projects were economically sound or replicable. The most promising
                    of the renewable energy forms were small hydro. We worked very closely with a
                    remarkable Frenchman, who was at that time the chief engineer of the National
                    Electric Office , the Office Nationale de l'�lectricit� (ONE), a gentleman named
                    Andre Fougerolles. He's still alive, living in southern France. He had lived in
                    Morocco since 1934. He knew that country like the palm of his hand. This man was
                    an historical monument to that country. Moroccans loved him. He trained a cadre
                    of Moroccan engineers in the National Electric Office who went on to lead in a
                    variety of engineering areas in the country. He was the design engineer and
                    supervising engineer for the construction of a very large earth-filled dam which
                    exists today at Bin El Ouidane in the Atlas Mountains in south central Morocco,
                    east of Marrakech. It produces electricity and irrigation. So, he was a major
                    figure in Morocco. Well, he took us under his wing and helped us discover some
                    places where it would be quite appropriate to put in a small hydroelectric
                    installation, a couple of kilowatts maybe (one to five kilowatts). Although we
                    picked three as pilot projects, in the end one was built.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why only one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Because AID economists did not consider that there was a sufficient
                    guarantee of economic viability and replicability. At that time, that was
                    probably true. I would say that it was the risk-averse nature to which AID has
                    increasingly succumbed, wanting guarantees before the fact that Project X will
                    succeed when you know that you don't know whether it will or not. But in this
                    particular case, this one installation did succeed when it was installed. It was
                    used and it is still being used in large part by a program financed by the
                    French foreign aid program to train Berbers in some of the fertile valleys of
                    the High Atlas mountains east of Marrakech to be actors in ecotourism - how to
                    guide tourists, how to run bed-and-breakfasts. This was an area off the beaten
                    track, beautiful areas where people liked to go with rucksacks and hike on
                    trails. It's become pretty popular, more for Europeans than for Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does this connect to the hydro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The facilities, this little hydro installation, supplies electric light and
                    electric power for a little training institution and also for other farms in the
                    valley to do things like pump water, grind grain, and various other things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it prove to be economic in that situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I don't know whether anybody has recently done a rigorous study of this,
                    but it still operates. I guess, if it wasn't worthwhile to maintain the thing,
                    it would probably fall into disuse. The National Electric Office always took the
                    position that they are not a charity organization and, therefore, in order to
                    have something be worth their attention, it's got to pay for itself. Since they
                    have kept an eye on this, apparently, it must have paid for itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The wind energy didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Things actually got installed after I left on the wind energy front. I
                    remember, I went to a wind area on the Atlantic coast northwest from Marrakech,
                    southwest from Casablanca, with one of Alan Jacobs' renewable energy experts,
                    John Kadiszewski, who the last I hear was with the Winrock Institute in Rosslyn.
                    We were scouting out some possible sites. There seemed to be considerable
                    promise that at least a few of these windmills would be installed, but I have no
                    idea whether AID actually went that far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about solar cells?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Flatplate collectors are apparently commercially available in Morocco at
                    this point. There are local manufacturers and people install them. For solar
                    cells, the main use has been in the military for remote transmitters and
                    repeating stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other dimensions of the program? You talked
                        about the population and so on. Were you involved in any of that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WARD: There was one notable success which Eric Griffel and I managed to get a
                    little project begrudgingly approved by our principals in AID/Washington. It
                    provided research grants to Moroccan graduate students for work on development
                    issues. We got into a conversation one time with a marvelous woman whom I met
                    while we were out there, a woman named Dr. Fatima Mernissi, one of the Arab
                    world's leading feminists, who at that time was a social scientist teaching at
                    Mohammad V University in Rabat. She said, “Look, here you have all these
                    consultants. You foreign aid people want to do something useful and you bring in
                    your consultants and ask them to help you design a project and what do they do?
                    The first thing they do is come to me or people like me. They don't know
                    anything about Morocco, the foreign consultants. They may know their field, but
                    they feel that it's necessary (quite rightly) to talk to people who live in this
                    country and who hopefully have some insights into what some of the problems are
                    and how one might realistically deal with them. Then they don't pay me any
                    money. They come back, they write their papers for you and you pay them. Then
                    they go back home. What you need to do is mobilize the local people more and
                    draw on the talent of the local people and the knowledge and experience of the
                    local people. How can you manage to do that?” Well, after a while, and after a
                    number of conversations, we put together a proposal for this little research
                    grant project, something which fitted into none of AID's priorities, could not
                    be demonstrated to produce success. Nevertheless, because it didn't involve very
                    much money, AID/Washington said, “Oh, well, this is just some of your spare
                    change. Go ahead. But let's look at it after a year.” AID/Washington grudgingly
                    approved it.</p>
                <p>Well, it was controversial in Morocco because we placed the responsibility of the
                    project in a research institute whose director was politically extremely prudent
                    and did not wish to use any of the funds to support research which could
                    conceivably criticize social or economic conditions in the Kingdom of Morocco.
                    As it happened, there were lots of things that one could usefully criticize in
                    the Kingdom of Morocco and perhaps find solutions to. But at that point, the
                    palace and the government were not interested in that sort of thing. So, nothing
                    happened. Almost a year passed. Despite all of our entreaties, the director of
                    the research institute did nothing. Fortunately, it was possible to transfer
                    responsibility for the project to another institute, Institut National de
                    Recherche Scientifique, whose leader had a bit more courage. Finally, they
                    managed to get a few research projects off the ground in areas relating to
                    agriculture, health, social development, population, things which would seem
                    politically innocuous and perhaps interesting. The research was done by graduate
                    students under the direction of various faculty members. They produced
                    monographs which, in fact, were quite good. The level of expertise at Mohammed V
                    University in the areas that we were concerned with was excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effect? What were the results of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WARD: I think the effect of what the Americans did was to get this thing started.
                    Once a few of the papers had been written and it became increasingly evident to
                    various decision makers in the government, in the various ministries, that
                    perhaps this wouldn't hurt them. Some of this information might actually be
                    useful. AID lost interest. The project was not a high priority. I think it
                    lasted for two years. We didn't renew it. This was after I had left. So, we
                    dropped out. Thanks in part to Fatima Mernissi's efforts the Germans decided to
                    finance the project. After all, the European aid programs, generally speaking,
                    tend to be somewhat less structured and a little bit less meticulously organized
                    and prioritized than the American activities. For that reason, sometimes they
                    are more successful. In any case, the Germans picked it up and kept it going.
                    One of the results is that a number of the beneficiaries of the research grants
                    are now skilled, successful, well-known Moroccan social scientists who have made
                    solid contributions to development. Some of them are running consulting firms.
                    At this moment, VITA is running a micro enterprise financing project in Morocco,
                    which from all reports seems to be doing rather well. That project was designed
                    with the active and very useful participation of a young social scientist at
                    Mohammed V University who was one of the beneficiaries of these grants and who
                    is now a faculty member and is highly reputed. So, little things like this, even
                    though you cannot tell what is going to happen, very often, yield very positive
                    results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That can be of considerable significance over time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right. It's like investing in small stocks. You never know whether
                    you've invested in the right one, but sometimes it's worth taking a chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have PL 480 programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. PL 480 Title II, in which food was distributed by Catholic Relief
                    Service. I guess that's the main one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For school feedings mainly or for other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: For small community level public works.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Food for Work type programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Food for Work programs, that's right. They were fairly modest, but it
                    worked pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You thought they worked all right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. We had some housing investment guarantees at a certain point. They
                    were not particularly terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they not terrific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were differences of view between the Moroccan government and the
                    Americans as to what an appropriate housing investment guarantee program might
                    be. For example, there was a large industrial slum on the northern edge of
                    Casablanca called Ben M'sik. The Moroccan government wanted to put a
                    superhighway right through the middle of it and bulldoze a lot of the houses out
                    of the way. The American planners thought that was a bad idea for an
                    AID-sponsored sites and services program. Unfortunately, we were never able to
                    agree on the correct way of handling this. I believe the World Bank finally did
                    agree with the Moroccan government on a rather modest sites and services
                    program, but that was after the Moroccan government had decided to suspend their
                    discussions with the Americans.</p>
                <p>There was a health program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that focused on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The purpose of that was to strengthen and establish rural health centers
                    all around the country. I can't remember if we had a component for training
                    paramedical people. I know there was a mother and child health program. I guess
                    our involvement was partly construction and partly mother and child health. I
                    think we've mentioned the other ones: agriculture, energy, population. We never
                    got very far in education. I have been to Morocco a few times in the last few
                    years and the program understandably has changed a lot. One of the emphases is
                    on assisting private training institutions (particularly trades training
                    institutions) to train a larger number of people in professions and in trades
                    which will get them jobs. This is playing a very useful role in the context of
                    the ten-year structural adjustment program which the Moroccan government has
                    been pursuing together with the World Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was not going on when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, that began in the 1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the Hassan II agricultural college was
                        particularly successful. Why did it stand out as a successful project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WARD: There was a lot of competition among foreign advisors for the hearts and
                    minds of the students and faculty at the Hassan II Agronomic Institute. The
                    Belgians were there. The French were there. The Americans were there. Each one
                    of them wanted to make sure that they called as many shots as possible. Because
                    of the long duration of the University of Minnesota contract, which carried out
                    this project, the Americans pretty well won. There were long-term relationships
                    forged between the graduate students and faculty members at Hassan II and the
                    University of Minnesota or other universities to which Moroccans were sent under
                    the University of Minnesota contract. So, this institutional linkage which was
                    created was an important aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what the scale of the program was roughly?
                        I'm talking about the total AID program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was pretty small during the period that I was there. I think we were
                    under $10 million for the technical assistance program most of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest in having a program in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Again, fundamentally political. There were questions about whether Morocco
                    was perhaps too advanced for an AID program. It was not one of your poverty
                    stricken sub-Saharan countries. Morocco is a great place to live. The

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Correct. King Hassan II had over the years played a facilitative role in
                    Arab-Israeli politics in the Eastern Mediterranean. He has encouraged back
                    channel dialogues at the encouragement of the United States government. He has
                    performed rather useful services. I guess that this program was part of a
                    symbolic recognition.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have the bases there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We did, that's correct. There were U.S. bases, a couple of them. There was
                    one in Kenitra, which was north from Rabat in the direction of Tangier. It was
                    phasing out about the time I arrived in the late 1970s. It was turned over to
                    the Moroccan government. By the time I left, there were no longer any bases
                    there. But surely the economic assistance program was part of a total aid
                    package.</p>

                        influenced by our political security interests in terms of being oriented in
                        any particular way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Not the content of the program. In fact, it was quite the reverse. We tend
                    to have, as I mentioned earlier on, in Burma, we have this tendency to make a
                    commitment to provide some form of economic assistance because of some political
                    reason. Then we tend to argue about the kind of economic assistance. We want to
                    do it our way and the local government wants to do it their way. Arguments go on
                    forever. In this particular case, in 1977, the economic aid program by and
                    large, because of its relatively small size and the fact that certain parts of
                    it were not particularly popular with the Moroccan government (for example, the
                    dry land agriculture aspect), was a program which we wanted more than the
                    Moroccans did. The Moroccans accepted the program, but without much enthusiasm
                    on the implementation level. They thought there were some marginally useful
                    things in the dry land farming program, but it was not something that they
                    really thought was high priority. They had a possibility of getting a lot more
                    money from the World Bank.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That didn't interfere with the political rationale for
                        having a program because you were somewhat at odds on the contents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The people who were concerned with the political basis for the program,
                    generally speaking, were different people from those concerned with operating
                    the program. This is a tension that I'm sure you've seen in many countries. The
                    AID people want to run a program which they honestly believe is going to yield
                    some economic development results. The State Department political officers don't
                    really care very much about that, but are more interested in a program which
                    will make the local government feel good. Sometimes there is a
                    contradiction.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WARD: At one point, I wrote a paper about a year after I got there outlining
                    three or four possibilities for the program, one of which was to phase it out.
                    The paper rejected the idea of just phasing out the program. First, it pointed
                    out that the Moroccans don't really care all that much about the program as a
                    whole. There are some parts that they think are okay, but they don't give it
                    very much priority. Therefore, it's not really serving our political interests,
                    so why not phase it out? Well, if you phase it out, it would give an unintended
                    political signal, so you shouldn't do that. Don't increase it unless you want to
                    carry out a program which the Moroccans want, but that wouldn't really work very
                    well because what they want isn't by and large the same as what AID will buy.
                    Therefore, straight-line it. Just let inflation gradually reduce its real value.
                    This paper didn't please anybody in AID. I thought it would be helpful to
                    clarify people's thinking. In the end, I think, what we did was to increase the
                    program slightly. AID happened to get a little bit more money that year. So, we
                    did increase the program. But it just kind of floated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, there were certain elements about which the Moroccan government was
                    quite enthusiastic. They were very enthusiastic about the renewable energy, for
                    example. In the meantime, however, the Moroccan government found it rather more
                    useful to deal with the World Bank, which had larger loans to provide. Generally
                    speaking, their interlocutors, the people who spoke for the World Bank in
                    discussions with the Moroccan government, were considerably more sophisticated
                    than the people who spoke for AID. Quite a few of them were French. One of their
                    key people was a former functionary in the French ministry of France. He knew
                    all the policy level finance officials in the Moroccan Government. The Moroccans
                    felt more at ease dealing with the World Bank people. They could get more money
                    for it, for their efforts. So, AID was kind of a back burner operation with the
                    exception of Hassan II Institute. That was a part that they liked. As I said
                    briefly, the renewable energy, population was okay. Agriculture was not. That
                    is, the dry land agriculture. So, it was a mixed bag. I don't have much of a
                    sense about how it is now. There are some lessons to be learned about how you
                    should handle aid programs so as to ensure that they work and perform whatever
                    political objectives they're supposed to perform. It's sometimes very difficult
                    to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Very good actually. I had very collegial relations with the people that I
                    was dealing with on the renewable energy front since, in the absence of an
                    actual energy expert, I became the resident energy expert in the AID mission. I
                    got on very well with the people in the Ministry of Finance. I liked Morocco and
                    they understood that. I spoke good French. So, we got along just fine.</p>

                        particular interaction with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes, particularly with the economic counselors as they came and went;
                    naturally, the agricultural attach�, who was always involved in negotiating the
                    PL 480 agreements. Then, one day, after Ambassador Robert Anderson left,
                    Ambassador Richard Parker appeared, our old political counselor from Cairo. In
                    the meantime, Dick Parker had been the DCM during the 1970s in Morocco. He had
                    then gone on to be ambassador in Algeria. Now he came back under the Carter
                    administration to be ambassador in Morocco. As one of the State Department's
                    leading Arabists, and a man of wonderful wit and humor, he was very attractive
                    to Morocco and attractive to Moroccans. He also was a very perceptive analyst of
                    the inner workings of the Moroccan government. The relation between the palace
                    and other political forces, the Makhzen, which is the Arabic word for the palace
                    authority. Dick Parker wrote a classic dispatch outlining the dynamics of the
                    palace, very much like some of George Kennan's essays written from his period in
                    Moscow as the American ambassador there before he was PNGed. Parker compared
                    King Hassan II with Fran�ois I in Renaissance France, who maintained his power
                    by a kind of balance of power operation in which he played off the various other
                    political regional forces and individuals against each other and maintained
                    himself as the primary authority. The King of Morocco still does that today. In
                    any case, it became very clear when Dick Parker came back as ambassador in 1979
                    that he knew too much. King Hassan II and the palace didn't want to have an
                    American ambassador who could see through them quite so easily. So, the White
                    House was persuaded to remove Ambassador Parker. He was replaced by somebody
                    else. But Dick Parker was very interested in economic development. He came over
                    to the AID mission a couple of times and expressed considerable interest in what
                    we were up to. If he had stayed, I'm sure that he would have been very
                    interested in seeing that there was a good AID program there.</p>

                <p>WARD: I think that's about all. I had one amazing experience in our probing
                    around for the small hydro sites. In my acquaintance with Andr� Fougerolles, the
                    former chief engineer of the National Electric Company, I went on a few skiing
                    trips with him, this person who knew the high Atlas mountains like the palm of
                    his hand. We went up into the mountains south from a place called Beni Mellal,
                    south of the Bin el Ouidane dam, which Fougerolles had helped construct, south
                    from a place called Asilal, up into a high mountain valley, which is totally
                    inaccessible from December until May because the mountain passes are closed with
                    snow. This is where we put the one site for the small hydro. On one trip we went
                    even further up into the mountains to go skiing. It was an absolutely superb
                    area for mountain skiing, probably the most remote part of the High Atlas
                    mountains. We stopped to visit some of the village head men. Some of these
                    village head men in that area, had been troops - goums berb�rs - in the French
                    army during World War II under Fougerolles when this engineer was a young
                    lieutenant. They had fought the battle up through Italy. They had been at Monte
                    Casino and had sustained a 20 percent casualty rate. They had come up through
                    Northern Italy. In the final days of the war, they liberated Stuttgart, my
                    wife's hometown. My wife and Andr� spent one evening in conversation comparing
                    his memories and my wife's memories of that period. Andr� remembered exactly
                    coming down the hill on which my wife's family's house was located.</p>
                <p>When we went up skiing we were warmly received by these village head men. We took
                    donkeys to carry our skis and our packs up to the top of the mountain and then
                    we skied down. I got about half way down to the bottom of the snow area and I
                    hit some ice. My ski binding refused to release, my foot turned around 180
                    degrees and I broke my left leg just about four inches above the ankle. It
                    didn't hurt. I grabbed it and I twisted it back around in place and it still
                    didn't hurt, amazingly. Two Berber guides were behind us. We found a place to
                    stay, a refuge of stones that some sheep herders had put up there in the summer.
                    We built a fire and stayed until about two o'clock in the morning. Somebody had
                    gone down and told the people down in the valley, where we were, and a mule
                    driver came up with his mules in the middle of the night. I was tied on a mule
                    and wrapped in blankets. My leg still didn't hurt. We got down to our base in
                    about two hours. With a few shots of Valium, I was trundled into the back of
                    somebody's station wagon and taken back to a hospital in Rabat, where there was
                    a wonderful Norwegian doctor who was practicing there. He said, “Norway promises
                    that you will ski again.” He fixed my leg up and it was all right. I had to pay
                    money to this mule driver - $50 or something like that - for transportation. I
                    got a signed receipt and sent all my bills and everything into my Blue
                    Cross/Blue Shield coverage for reimbursement. Some weeks later a note came back
                    saying, “We reimburse for ambulances or other normal transportation. This is not
                    normal transportation.” So much for the bureaucratic inflexibility of modern
                    society. That's an experience that Andr� Fougerolles and I have thought about a
                    number of times. Since he retired (he is now 85 years old), he has kept his
                    finger on the pulse of ecotourism French training program. He has gone back to
                    Morocco as kind of counselor emeritus to advise the Ministry of Tourism and the
                    Ministry of Electricity, and he is always welcomed back there as a big brother
                    and local hero. He is still very vigorous, living in the mountains west of N�mes
                    in Provence.</p>

                <p>WARD: During my period in Morocco, I managed to learn enough about energy so I
                    could come back to AID/Washington and be the Energy Advisor for the Africa
                    Bureau. I worked very closely again in Washington with Alan Jacobs in the Energy
                    Office. I was working in the office of John Blumgart, who retired from AID in
                    1982. I replaced him as chief of the Special Projects Division in the Office of
                    Technical Resources in the Africa Bureau. That was a rather interesting period
                    because we were looking at our renewable energy activities, but getting more
                    involved in environmental activities and forestry activities. The fad of
                    renewable energy was waning. We no longer had the oil crisis. We thought it
                    would be a good idea to examine the various renewable energy activities which
                    existed, many of which AID had put in place in Africa. W signed a contract with
                    hired Associates in Rural Development of Burlington, Vermont. Together with
                    Molly Hageboeck, then AID's guru of evaluation, now with the Management Systems
                    International consulting firm, we concocted a rather well designed scheme for
                    fanning out teams to various countries in Africa and examining - in the manner
                    of the impact evaluations which Doug Bennet's started when he was AID
                    Administrator - some of the renewable energy projects. The result was a report
                    on what appeared to be working and what appeared not to be working.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the conclusions of the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Some of the conclusions were that there was a lot that didn't seem to be
                    working. There was a major French presence in the former French colonies of West
                    Africa, and French firms had received French government financing to install
                    flat plate collectors and other renewable energy devices. Unfortunately in many
                    cases not much thought had been given to maintenance so a lot of these things
                    were falling apart. We found some of the projects for getting gas from organic
                    waste seemed to be working, but only under very special conditions where you had
                    lots of pigs around to produce organic waste, for example. There was
                    considerable enthusiasm in the AID/Africa Bureau for more efficient wood stoves.
                    We found that a whole range of foreign donors (European, Canadian, American)
                    were pushing various kinds of wood stoves in different countries, but the
                    programs didn't seem to be working all that well because there were the
                    perennial problems of marketing. How do you convince people that they ought to
                    use these things? Sometimes, the wood stoves didn't work all that well
                    anyway.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WARD: There were wood stoves which you could make out of metal and then there
                    were other wood stoves which you could make out of clay. The idea was simply
                    that they were supposed to be an improvement over the open fires that many
                    people were using and that they would burn wood more efficiently and you could
                    concentrate the heat on your pots better so that you would reduce the amount of
                    waste. That was fine as far as it went. But there were a whole range of
                    educational and marketing problems which really weren't being addressed. They
                    never really were effectively dealt with. So, we were rushing about with various
                    experimental pilot projects to try to do things in the renewable energy area. It
                    was a distinctly mixed bag. So much depended on the kind of institution that was
                    trying to run things. For example, in Rwanda, the Swiss were running a very good
                    project for drying fish so that you wouldn't have the fish rot. You could sell
                    them and market them and, in some cases, even export them. That worked pretty
                    well. Some of the wood stove projects were okay. But the more we looked at the
                    wood stove business, we began to see that it was intimately related to forestry
                    problems. How do you encourage people not to cut down trees prematurely? I
                    remember one of the roads out of Ouagadougou in Upper Volta, Burkina Faso. We
                    were told that three years before all the trees had been cut for a perimeter of
                    30 miles outside of Ouagadougou. “This year,” we were told, “it's 50 miles
                    outside of Ouagadougou. Next year, it's going to be 70 miles.” So, there was a
                    shift of focus to forestry. Social forestry- We had a great forester in the
                    Africa Bureau Office of Technical Resources who is still practicing - Tom
                    Catterson. He is an independent consultant now. He had an excellent network of
                    fellow foresters, European and African. He helped to focus our attention on
                    social forestry, how you encourage people to live with forests without
                    destroying them, or live with trees without destroying them. For example,
                    growing certain crops and trees in the same field can help each other in a
                    symbiotic relationship. We became more interested in forestry and, to some
                    degree, also in environmental affairs. It would be interesting to ask someone
                    like Tom Catterson (T: (315) 853 1537) what his perception of how the foreign
                    aid approach of the Europeans and the North Americans has changed, what lessons
                    have been learned in the past 10 years or more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time you were working there, did you develop some
                        sort of a policy paper or a strategy paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. The energy advisor for the AID mission in Kenya had up until that time
                    been Weston (Wes) Fisher, who came to work in my office in Washington as the
                    energy advisor when I stopped being the energy advisor. He worked on an energy
                    policy paper, which tried to apply some of the lessons that we thought we had
                    learned from our evaluation and to make some suggestions about other things to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it broadly, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WARD: Pay more attention to replicability and to the economics of things, the
                    exact opposite of what I would argue for Moroccan small hydro; try to think more
                    about the marketing aspects and the education information aspects of things; try
                    to involve the private sector more in production and marketing. I'm sure there
                    were some other useful lessons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social forestry, was that part of it? That came
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That came a little bit later. But there was an energy strategy statement
                    which exists and can be found, I'm sure, in the CDIE library.</p>
                <p>In our Africa/Technical Resources office we had three foresters, three energy
                    people, and three environmentalists. Tom worked closely with the late Fran
                    Gulick, a wonderful woman, who had spent time with her husband, Clarence Gulick,
                    also now dead, in India at the time John Lewis was leading the AID Mission
                    there. One of Tom Catterson's notable accomplishments, in any case, was
                    organizing a conference in Abidjan of foresters who were quite familiar with the
                    Africa scene. There were a couple of volumes which were published when you were
                    running the evaluation operation in AID/Washington, a couple of big, yellow
                    volumes on African forestry. It would be interesting using those studies and
                    recommendations as kind of a baseline just to see what, if anything, has
                    happened or been learned since then in the same area.</p>
                <p>Tom Catterson was an Adjunct Professor at Syracuse University. In our office, we
                    had three people at one time or another who were brought in under the
                    Intergovernmental Exchange Act, which permitted people who were at state
                    universities or state level governments to spend some time on detached service
                    in a federal government agency. Tom had gone to Syracuse University College of
                    Forestry. He had served several years with the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization. He then spent some time in AID/Washington, after which he went to
                    work for the Burlington, Vermont consulting firm of Associates in Rural
                    Development, run by George Burrill. Tom was his chief natural resources advisor
                    for several years but has since become an independent consultant. He has lately
                    been doing work in Haiti, certainly a place that needs help with forests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working in the Africa Bureau? What was
                        the situation in the Africa Bureau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We had the good fortune in the Office of Technical Resources of being led
                    by Lane Holdcroft, who was a very good, very wise, strategically astute,
                    technical person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the mission was receptive to what you
                        were promoting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WARD: Sometimes. What we found rather interesting was, when Tom and I began to
                    realize that it was important to try to encourage a better relationship between
                    growing crops and growing trees, that they were not necessarily competitive, we
                    had trouble with our own agricultural people. Agricultural people say “Trees are
                    the enemy. Get rid of them so we can grow crops.” The foresters, naturally, take
                    a different view. So, I would be interested to know what state of play that is
                    in now. You read more and more and more about the mutually supportive relation
                    that must exist between food crops and other crops, but I don't know how that
                    has played itself out in the AID world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have special funding for your activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Not much. We had to depend pretty much on what was built into individual
                    country programs. This was the beginning of the period where you could have
                    buy-ins to centrally funded activities of one kind or another. There was some of
                    that. But that was mainly like venture capital to get things off the ground. But
                    to continue anything, you needed to have something in the country program. So,
                    that took care of the period up until 1984, at which point I left the Africa
                    Bureau to join the United Nations Division of the Office of Donor Coordination
                    in the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination. There I reported to Joan
                    Dudick Gayoso.</p>
                <p>New assignment as UN donor coordination - 1984-1987</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a shift.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your function there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was the head of the UN division. There was one division that dealt with
                    the World Bank and OPIC and the other lending agencies. There was a division for
                    DAC and OECD affairs headed by Jerome Sherry. There was my UN division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you supposed to be trying to accomplish with
                        that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WARD: With all of the various UN development agencies, we tried to arrange for
                    AID to speak with one voice. There would be meetings and liaison with the
                    different development organizations like FAO, the World Health Organization,
                    UNICEF, the UN Environment Program, UNDP, and others. When issues were
                    discussed, we made sure that whoever represented the United States at these
                    meetings would say the right thing as far as AID was concerned. We worked very
                    closely with the development office in the Bureau for International
                    Organizations in the Department of State, run by Joan's husband, Tony Gayoso,
                    formerly of AID. We worked very closely with them in formulating the various
                    papers and positions and talking points and things like that. We would go to
                    some of these meetings. I used to go to the UNDP meetings in New York and FAO
                    meetings in Rome. At that point, we had people like Jim Kelly, who was one of
                    the people representing AID at the United States Mission to the United Nations
                    in New York. The second person was my former Mission Director in Morocco, Harold
                    Fleming. We wanted to make sure that they had the correct ammunition in their
                    hands to make representations and state the correct United States position,
                    properly cleared through the various regional bureaus. At various points along
                    the way, when there would be crises like the Sahel drought, the Ethiopian
                    famine, various other major disasters in Africa, at that point, you would find a
                    very close combination of collaboration and competitiveness between AID, led by
                    Peter McPherson, and UNICEF, led by Jim Grant. It was just wonderful to see. In
                    some ways, we were collaborating very much. In other ways, clearly, we were
                    competing with each other. The two organizations inspired each other to do
                    better. In due course, Harold Fleming went to join Jim Grant in UNICEF as his
                    senior program person. Because of Harold's experience in overseas missions- He
                    had been Peace Corps director in Ivory Coast. He had been AID Mission Director
                    in Morocco. He had been around to a lot of African countries both during his AID
                    period and his UNICEF period. He was able to speak with considerable authority
                    about the realities on the ground when very few of the other country
                    representatives meeting in New York were able to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the main issues that you had to deal
                        with in those relationships in coordinating AID and State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were always pushing for UN reform, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: More efficiency and less bureaucracy. It's kind of like the pot calling the
                    kettle black, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some specific things we were trying to get them
                        to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WARD: I don't think we were ever all that specific. We were pushing for
                    simplification of the structure of UNDP, if I recall. We certainly had opinions
                    about who should lead these organizations. We had our candidates, naturally,
                    working together with the State/IO people, for who would run UNDP or who ought
                    to get such and such a position in WHO. We worked very closely for a certain
                    time with WHO on low cost approaches to medicine. WHO was very much interested
                    in the barefoot doctor approach to mass health. We were very interested in
                    collaborating with them on that. As AID got more and more interested in
                    environmental matters and, as it happened, Joe Wheeler was the American
                    representative to the UN environment program for a certain period, we were
                    making sure that we were all on the same wavelength.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you review UN projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our aim in doing that? How did we go about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Here was kind of an effort similar to what I had briefly gotten involved in
                    after I came back to Washington in 1972 in this Office of Project Review and
                    Evaluation. Here we were trying to bring to bear whatever we might have learned
                    about AID's projects and programs and approaches to see if we could make some
                    constructive criticism about some of the things that UNDP was doing. All of
                    these were done with minimal information and at some distance, but sometimes we
                    were able to actually make some useful suggestions. It was rather interesting to
                    see in our conversations with the representatives of the various European aid
                    groups (the Scandinavians, the Germans, even the French) that sometimes they
                    would be looking with some admiration at AID's approaches and wanting to imitate
                    them in AID's structure and ways of dealing with some of the priority problems.
                    They said, “We're very interested in the way that AID has organized itself. We'd
                    like to do the same thing.” This was just about the time that quite a number of
                    people were saying, “If what we're doing isn't the right way, let's try
                    something else.” It's all kind of mixed. I would tend to encourage the Europeans
                    to come to Washington and talk with a number of people. I would try to tell them
                    the pros and the cons of what we were doing, of some things were helping and
                    some things were not helping. But I don't really know about how far the various
                    European aid groups went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of thing specifically were you talking about
                        pros and cons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was partly our approach to evaluation and partly our structure by region
                    or by function, of which we had a bit of both.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular common strands to AID's comments
                        on UN projects? Were there some common points we kept making over and
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We tended to complain that UNDP programs didn't adhere rigorously enough to
                    a coherent strategy, that they were just all over the map, based on probably
                    internal UNDP politics or something. I think that was a legitimate concern, but
                    in an international organization, there is not an awful lot you can do about it.
                    We, of course, admired Jim Grant's UNICEF efforts very much. Jim Grant had the
                    ability to not only conceptualize what he was doing and show how a specific set
                    of actions really had some chance of accomplishing what you wanted to
                    accomplish, and also packaging it and presenting it so that you'd be sitting on
                    the edge of your chair with excitement after he got through with you, saying, “I
                    can hardly wait to get out and do something about this.” He was just
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any particular topics or initiatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I remember, during the period that low cost health and medicine were of
                    interest (That was of considerable priority in the early or mid ''70s.), driving
                    once with Jim Grant from the Overseas Development Council up to Johns Hopkins in
                    Baltimore where he was delivering a presentation on low cost health services. He
                    was wondering about what AID's thought processes were like these days. He had,
                    after all, been in AID back in the days when he started off as a Mission
                    Director in Turkey back in the 1960s. He created PPC. I think they had about
                    three or four people back in the early days. Then he was giving me his views on
                    what really might be possible if you could organize a program of barefoot
                    doctors. What the Chinese were doing at that time was very much in the public
                    eye. He was really inspiring. To listen to the way he inspired some of these
                    doctors up at Johns Hopkins to think a little bit more about the proper role of
                    paramedics, it was just wonderful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other dimensions of your work with the UN
                        organizations? Apart from UNICEF, which ones did you think were more
                        effective? Or were they all pretty much the same?</hi>

                <p>WARD: FAO is hard to assess. It's so big. Edward Saouma, former Lebanese Minister
                    of Agriculture, was the Director of FAO at the time I was going to their
                    meetings. He was considered by the AID people who had much to do with him as
                    something of a Machiavelli, a political intriguer. I think he was quite
                    effective though. However, he had a huge organization which probably has
                    bureaucratic problems. He was very good at publicity, a lot of films and
                    publications to tell you how wonderful FAO was. Talking, however, with some of
                    the people who worked in FAO, some of their areas were very effectively run. The
                    forestry people in FAO did a lot of good work. I just know through Tom something
                    of what the FAO forestry people were doing. Like so many of these larger
                    organizations, you can find what you want to find. There are probably some
                    absolutely terrible aspects, but some of them were very good. Just as you were
                    saying earlier about AID - you can find what you want.</p>
                <p>Returned to USAID/Egypt - 1987</p>
                <p>WARD: I left the UN Division in 1987 to go to Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right, for another two year period from 1987 to 1989, almost two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: By that time we had a huge AID mission, the biggest AID mission in the
                    world. Your normal division, what would be a division or a separate office in
                    some normal AID mission, would be headed by somebody who had been a Mission
                    Director someplace. It was very large. I was in the Directorate for Trade and
                    Investment, run by Gregory Huger, who is, I believe, Director of one of our
                    missions in the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the function of that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: A variety of things. We were pushing private enterprise in various forms,
                    trying to encourage the Egyptians to level the playing field for the private
                    sector. We had a project to try to reactivate the capital markets, the stock
                    market. There had been a stock market before the 1952 Revolution. I even met one
                    old man who was associated with the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram who remembered
                    that stock market favorably. But anybody under the age of 50 wouldn't have the
                    foggiest idea what the stock market was like.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that supported by the Egyptian government, getting the
                        stock market going, the private sector going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, not the stock market. There was certainly lip service to the private
                    sector. After all, by that time, Anwar Sadat had come into power and there was
                    an effort to try to liberalize, free up the private sector somewhat, not as much
                    as we thought was desirable, but certainly more than your average Arab socialist
                    functionary would think desirable. We met a rather diverse group of people. Some
                    of the people we worked with were fairly substantial businessmen who had made a
                    great deal of money since the arrival of Sadat and since the opening up to the
                    outside world and the relative freeing of the private sector. Not all of these
                    people were clean cut capitalists. They weren't quite as criminal as you read
                    about in Moscow these days, but nevertheless, they were substantial businessmen.
                    They were not so much the kind of people who needed a great deal of help. But
                    some of them were very sincere and serious and effective people, who were very
                    much Western oriented. We used to go all the time to see Egyptians who were
                    members of the Egyptian-American Chamber of Commerce, which would meet
                    regularly. I believe, in a situation like that, there is a lot to be gained by
                    starting off, at least, working with the more substantial capitalists in the
                    same way that in the days of the Green Revolution in Pakistan, we started off
                    working with the wealthier farmers and there was an imitation effect with the
                    smaller ones. We had a customs reform program. There were some people from the
                    U.S. Customs Agency who were working largely in Alexandria trying to bring more
                    efficiency into the Byzantine complexity of customs administration. I don't know
                    that that was particularly effective. It was okay as far as it went. It's good
                    to try to make a bureaucracy relatively more efficient. But the key issues were
                    not the ones which the working level functionaries would deal with. They key
                    issues were ones which more senior decision makers would have to deal with. The
                    attitude of the government was, “We'd like to keep regulation.” So, that was
                    partially successful.” This AID mission was so large that it was entirely
                    possible to work in one section and know little or nothing about what was
                    happening in the others. There was a Science and Technology section, which
                    dealt, among other things, with oil prices, energy, coal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all under the Trade and Investment section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, this was totally separate. There was a whole other section which
                    funneled a considerable amount of assistance not through the central government
                    in Cairo, but directly to the governorates. The governorates were the provinces.
                    That was largely for different kinds of infrastructure: schools, hospitals,
                    roads, things like that. I think that worked pretty well, at least from the
                    people I talked to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in your trade investment area? You were doing
                        customs, capital markets. Was there anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WARD: We had a major Commodity Import Program that was providing dollars for
                    buying American exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the commodities selected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was negotiated between the Americans and the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which activities were you directing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: First I did a paper to outline the current trade and investment climate and
                    USAID/Egypt's action plan, an analytical framework. The idea was to get an idea
                    as to what it would be necessary to do to encourage greater investment by
                    Egyptian capital in Egypt and what, if anything, it would be necessary to do to
                    encourage a greater openness to external trade above and beyond the commodity
                    import program. We consulted with a number of the Egyptian businessmen who had a
                    choice between investing in Egypt or not investing in Egypt. Basically, the one
                    message that we got very loudly and clearly was the really felt need for
                    external management technical assistance, particularly in the private sector.
                    There was a considerable desire on the part of some of the Egyptian businessmen
                    we met to try to bring in new products and establish production facilities in
                    Egypt. They were constantly feeling the dead hand of government, local
                    governments, which were causing them costs and delays. They also felt the need
                    of advice. I remember, there was a fellow who was a banker, whose family had
                    been a major textile export before they were expropriated during the Nasser
                    period. He had worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington and had
                    gone to Kuwait to help establish the Kuwait Development Bank. Now, here he was
                    back in Egypt and he wanted to invest some money. He said, “Well, you know, one
                    of the key difficulties is loan officers in banks. These kids don't know
                    anything. The Achilles heel of banks is that loan officers don't understand how
                    to analyze possible loan prospects. What we need to do is train more and better
                    loan officers. Then, that will open up a serious bottleneck to lending to viable
                    projects as opposed to just throwing your money out the window.” He had
                    established a factory for making paper towels. He had a partner who was an
                    Italian, whose family had been in paper making for a long time, purely in the
                    private sector. They worked out an arrangement so they were actually producing
                    things in Egypt for Egyptian consumption. They had some the Egyptian banker's
                    management skill and the Italian's technical ability. It worked fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did AID have a role in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: None whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the kind of thing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, we were exploring what seemed to be working to see what kinds of
                    things AID might do to be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you end up with AID doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We had our Commodity Import Program, which was intended to benefit the
                    private sector more than the public sector. We brought in some people to
                    encourage employee stock ownership plans, which a fellow named Bruce Mazzie was
                    pushing. Bruce was associated with Management Systems International in
                    Washington, run by Larry Cooley. The thought was, “Perhaps this is a form of
                    capitalism which can appeal to people who were formerly Arab socialists because
                    it sounds like popular investment.” We never did get it off the ground. There
                    were some discussions between the Pirelli Tire Company and the Alexandria Tire
                    Company. But I don't think it ever got off the ground. One of the things which,
                    during my last year in Cairo, I got involved with was keeping an eye on some of
                    the old projects - loan financed industrial production projects, which AID had
                    begun to finance during the period when we still were not yet against state run
                    enterprises. We had a steel rolling mill and a leather manufacturing place and a
                    soap and oils factory and a fertilizer plant and a couple of others. Some of
                    these were in Cairo. One was down in the Delta. A couple were in Alexandria.
                    Once a month, my Egyptian counterpart and I would go around and visit these
                    places. The idea was to make sure that they came to successful conclusions and
                    to try to quickly solve whatever problems might arise between the American
                    contractors, who were usually carrying out these projects, and the Egyptian
                    state run enterprise directors, who were the collaborators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were trying to privatize them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, that wasn't part of the project. These were projects that we didn't
                    want to shine the spotlight on because part of our office was very much trying
                    to push privatizing and freeing up, reducing regulations which might hamper the
                    private sector. We just wanted to finish up these old state run projects and get
                    them out of the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which we had been involved in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WARD: Which we had been supporting during previous years. I think they were
                    approved during the period when Frank Kimball was the Mission Director. That was
                    the last period when we were actually putting money into these things. Some of
                    them were working actually quite well. I was quite impressed by the high
                    standards of the Egyptian leadership in some of them, not all of them. Sometimes
                    the American contractors were as much a part of the problem as the Egyptians
                    were. I think they ended pretty well. Basically, we were simply trying to find
                    where there were problems and try to think of practical solutions. Usually my
                    Egyptian counterpart and I would recognize after a few tours of these plants
                    what was going wrong and what needed to be done. We would bring the Egyptians
                    and the American contractors together and try to work out solutions. It was a
                    matter of basically being the honest broker between the American contractor and
                    the Egyptian leadership of the individual factory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Try to get them efficient and then get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And not close them down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: One of them was down on the west side of Sinai. Here was a gypsum plant. It
                    was very good. It was very well constructed and it was operating efficiently.
                    The problem was what to do with the product. One of the American contractors who
                    was assisting said, “Well, we can make sheetrock. I think there's a market for
                    sheetrock in Saudi Arabia. They're building a lot of buildings.” I left before
                    we solved that problem. But here was a factory which was producing things okay.
                    But the marketing hadn't been handled very well. In any case, the professional
                    quality of the Egyptians was generally good. Usually once we identified what the
                    argument was about, we didn't exactly knock heads together, but we would arrange
                    for some fairly frank discussions - sensitivity sessions. We would get the
                    American contractors and the Egyptian factory officials around the table and
                    we'd all have our cup of tea. I would say for the American contractors, “This is
                    what our Egyptian colleagues are saying is the problem. This is what you're
                    saying is the problem. Now, let's just put our heads together and think about
                    how we can bring this down the pike.” Just the fact of our presence as kind of a
                    little catalyst for discussion, just so that people wouldn't walk away mad,
                    helped a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's how I spent my last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WARD: Then on the Fourth of July in 1989 in Cairo I retired from AID.</p>
                <p>I did a bit of independent consulting after leaving, mostly for Washington-based
                    consulting firms under contracts with AID. During the past few years I helped
                    with the design or evaluation of projects in a number of areas - design of a
                    women in development in Burundi, evaluations of the Africa Private Enterprise
                    Fund, a private sector export promotion project and a privatization sector
                    assistance program in Morocco, design of a market development project in
                    Madagascar, and a number of other things. I learned something from all of these
                    assignments. AID, like a number of other government agencies, was in the throes
                    of “reengineering”. The “objective tree” approach to program strategy was
                    evolving, also with the active involvement of consulting contractors. These and
                    their successor initiatives were intended, I presume, as efforts to make AID
                    work more efficiently and coherently. In Mission after Mission I visited during
                    this consulting period, I had the impression that almost the opposite result was
                    being achieved. More and more time was being devoted to internal AID Mission
                    meetings endeavoring to apply the reengineering and objective tree concepts and
                    principles to the programs. Contractors were left to do more and more of the
                    actual development work as AID staff wrestled with reengineering and attended to
                    the increasingly voluminous communications with AID/Washington. Then, more
                    recently, the field contract staff was sucked into the same quagmire which
                    deflected their energies from the real work. The AID incentive structure
                    appeared, at least to this outside viewer, to encourage more attention to the
                    increasingly complex AID doctrines and conceptual structures and less attention
                    to the solving of real problems on the ground. I sensed that many AID field
                    staff, however competent, were being prevented from doing serious development
                    work because they were being throttled by a bad system. I discovered in talking
                    with other development professions, both AID direct hire and contractors, that I
                    was not alone in this view. Where there was a political imperative, as in Egypt,
                    AID was able to be very flexible indeed. Elsewhere the demanding rules of AID's
                    style of development assistance ruled more rigorously in the name of
                    accountability. In many cases, I think, AID was thus made less effective both as
                    an instrument of development and for political ends, and I believe this problem
                    continues.</p>

                <p>I recall that during my first months with AID in 1961, I met a man who had been
                    seconded to AID from the State Department. He was very enthusiastic, he said,
                    about AID's relatively free-wheeling approach to its work. In State, he said,
                    there was always someone who would pull out one of the volumes of regulations to
                    show you why it was not possible to do something you wished to do. In AID, by
                    contrast, the rules were only then beginning to be written, and it was much
                    easier for a person of vision and energy to achieve something of solid value. It
                    would seem that AID has now reached the opposite extreme, sliding across the
                    scale from opportunities and pitfalls of freedom to the stultifying routines of
                    a self-imposed but not particularly productive discipline. Max Weber, the German
                    political scientist, theorized about the rise and fall of bureaucratic
                    structures, and concluded that somewhere there was a mid-point at which the
                    proper balance of freedom and order allowed effective action, but that this
                    condition was difficult to maintain and most often government structures became
                    sclerotic over time and declined into irrelevance. This may already have
                    occurred in AID. The level of competence has been rising sharply in many
                    developing countries. Civil society has been strengthening, much more
                    communication and exchange of knowledge now takes place within the private
                    sector - corporations, foundations, NGOs - between the industrialized and
                    developing countries. AID is increasingly a marginal player. Its efforts to
                    redefine itself and its mission have not so far been notably successful, so far
                    as I can tell. Perhaps institutional self-interest is too much at stake.</p>
                <p>I feel fortunate to have spent my career with an organization which allowed me to
                    do interesting things in interesting places. It was a time when the organization
                    itself was not yet stifling and we were exploring then uncharted paths in an
                    effort to improve the lives of the many. It was rewarding, even exciting, while
                    it lasted. I'm glad I left in time.</p>
