                <p>AMBASSADOR RUDOLF V. PERINA</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Interview Date: December, 2006</p>
                <p>Copyright 2008</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was born in Czechoslovakia on January 3, 1945 in a town called Tabor in
                    southern Bohemia which was the seat of the Hussites in the 15th century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always think of the Hussites and their armored vehicles.
                        That's quite a legacy. What do you know about your family on your father's
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I see myself as a product of 20th-century Central European history. My
                    father owned a lumber mill in southern Bohemia started by his grandfather in the
                    19th century. It was a fairly large enterprise that exported lumber all the way
                    to Germany and throughout Central Europe in the inter-war period. He was thus
                    considered a capitalist by Communists, which came into play after World War
                    II.</p>
                <p>On my mother's side, her father was a civil servant in Bohemia. He was also
                    trained as a lawyer and served as a type of deputy mayor in the town of Tabor.
                    He was during World War II one of the many Czechs executed following the
                    assassination in 1942 of Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the German occupation of
                    Bohemia and the most senior Nazi successfully assassinated during the war. The
                    well-known destruction of the town of Lidice was one part of the retaliation for
                    Heydrich's death but in fact thousands of people throughout the country were
                    executed as well. The Germans targeted public figures and those suspected of
                    being Czech nationalists. My grandfather, as a representative of the town
                    government, and his brother who had been a military officer in the Czech army,
                    were arrested within days of Heydrich's death. They were executed by firing
                    squad on June 10, 1942. About 180 other people from Tabor were also executed
                    over the course of the next few weeks. My mother was 17 years old at the time
                    and learned of her father's and uncle's execution through the newspapers. It was
                    a defining experience for the rest of her life.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk a little more about the town of Tabor and
                        how far back it goes. Where did the town fit into Bohemian history? I don't
                        know much about that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, the name Tabor comes from Mount Tabor, which is referred to in the
                    Bible. The town was founded by the Hussites in the early 1400's. The Hussite
                    movement was really a type of religious uprising by followers of Jan Hus who was
                    a precursor of Luther in criticism of Church corruption. He was invited to meet
                    with representatives of the Pope at the Council of Constance in 1415. Though
                    guaranteed safe passage, he was in fact arrested and burned at the stake as a
                    heretic. This sparked other social and ethnic tensions of the declining feudal
                    order and led to a kind of peasant uprising against the Church and the
                    establishment. The rebellion gained momentum and led to what is known as the
                    Hussite Wars. All of this was, of course, more complex than I am making it sound
                    here. The most famous leader of the Hussites was a fellow named Jan Zizka, and
                    it was his followers who established this town of Tabor. He was a brilliant
                    military commander who defeated Papal armies across Bohemia despite eventually
                    losing both eyes in battle. Tabor is very identified with this history and with
                    Jan Zizka, whose statue is on the main square.</p>
                <p>My mother's side of the family moved there from the Pilsen region after World War
                    I. My father's side of the family, as far as I know, had been in Tabor much
                    further back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sudetenland or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. It was outside the Sudetenland. It was part of Bohemia and then it
                    became part of the Bohemian Protectorate established by the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the Hussite history, was this a Protestant area?
                        What was your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Following the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620 when the Hapsburgs
                    defeated the Bohemian forces, there was a counter- Reformation and most of the
                    country was re-Catholicized. So most Czechs are Catholic but not very good
                    Catholics. The Church does not have the standing that it does in Poland, for
                    example. This applies to my family. We were technically Catholic but not
                    practicing Catholics or particularly devout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the education of both your mother and
                        father?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PERINA: My father was raised to inherit the family lumber business as was the
                    custom of the time. That's why he had the same name as his father, and I'm
                    actually the third Rudolf Perina because it was assumed that I would take over
                    the business someday. My father was educated as a lawyer which is what one
                    studied to go into business. He had a doctor of law degree from Prague
                    University. He grew up in this little village outside of Tabor called Plana nad
                    Luznici where the lumber mill was located on a river bank. Most timber at the
                    time was transported by waterways.</p>
                <p>My mother studied at a Prague vocational school for secretaries and clerical
                    workers. That is where she was when she learned that her father had been
                    arrested. My mother actually studied some English in this school. My father knew
                    more German and Latin, which did not help much later in America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you were born in 1945 which was sort of a
                        critical time at the end of the war. How did things go during the war? Then
                        we'll talk about the Soviet occupation which obviously you didn't experience
                        but you were hearing about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, during the war my father was allowed to continue operating his
                    business because the Germans wanted it to continue as a source of lumber and
                    wood. He was able to continue operating, though under all the rules of the
                    Protectorate. My mother's family was in a much more difficult situation because
                    when the father was executed the family was also condemned to confiscation of
                    property. She had horrible stories of how a carload of soldiers came with a
                    truck to the house a few days after my grandfather had been executed. They went
                    through the house and took anything of value: pictures, jewelry, the radio,
                    pieces of furniture etc. They left the family with minimal necessities to
                    survive. This was a family of two daughters and two sons, a mother and four
                    children. They were allowed to stay in the house but they lost title to it, and
                    they were moved to the upstairs of the house, with a German family moving into
                    the first floor. It was a very difficult period for my mother through the end of
                    the war. She also had to leave school and was put to work in a factory. Then she
                    met my father, and they were married in 1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there family stories about when the Soviets came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. This is when we get to the next chapter of Central European history.
                    I heard many stories about encounters with the Russian army from my parents.
                    Apparently, at one time I was almost kidnapped by a Russian soldier who was
                    drunk and thought I was really cute and wanted to take me with him. In the last
                    months of the war, there was an incident very close to our house, actually just
                    across the road, where there was a railroad track. There was an air raid and my
                    parents saw what people said were American planes coming in and bombing the
                    railroad tracks. With the Russian army, however, the main problem was a total
                    lack of logistical support in the military structure. Russian soldiers had to
                    find their own food and support themselves from the territory through which they
                    passed. Thus stealing and ravaging the countryside were sort of unavoidable. But
                    the real problem came with the domestic political situation after the War.
                    Russia and the Czech Communist Party were the strongest political influences in
                    the country. In February 1948, Communist Party leader Klement Gottwald came to
                    power and began a policy of radical socialization: confiscating factories,
                    businesses, persecuting so-called capitalists and so on. At that time, my
                    parents and many others didn't believe that the Communist government would last
                    very long. Everybody thought it would collapse, given the chaos developing in
                    the economy. Very quickly, however, the government started turning against the
                    so-called capitalists, which included my father's family. It was wealthy in the
                    context of this little town but not really in a broader context.</p>
                <p>The persecution became so threatening that my father felt he had to escape from
                    the country. At the time, he still believed that it was a temporary move and
                    that the Communists wouldn't last long. He escaped from Czechoslovakia by
                    illegally crossing the border into Austria. He expected to be back in a year or
                    two when the Communists collapsed but it soon became evident that the Communist
                    government might last longer than anyone thought.</p>
                <p>As things kept getting worse, my mother decided to take me and to join my father,
                    even though by then it was much more difficult to escape. When my father left
                    not long after the Communist takeover, the borders were still not very tightly
                    controlled. By the time my mother and I were trying to leave, it was a challenge
                    to get across the border. There were lots of patrols and so on. Had my mother
                    been captured during such an attempted escape, she would have gone to prison and
                    I would have been put into a foster home. My mother's sister, my aunt, was
                    married to a Yugoslav, a Croat, and through him my mother found and hired
                    professional Yugoslav smugglers to take us across the border. Yugoslav citizens
                    were already then in a unique position— able to travel more freely than
                    Communist bloc citizens but not considered enemies by the governments. The
                    Yugoslavs my mother found were Croats who made a business of going back and
                    forth across the border smuggling various commodities on which one could make a
                    profit in post-war Europe. She paid them to take her and me across during one of
                    their crossings. There were three or four of these fellows and I was tied to the
                    back of one of them, and he carried me across the border overnight. I was
                    apparently given something to drink to keep me drowsy and quiet. Still, I do
                    believe I remember some of that night because it was so tense and unusual. It
                    was the night of January 28 1950. Obviously we made it across the border into
                    Austria.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My father by that time was living in Zurich, Switzerland which he had reached
                    through some pre-war business contacts, and after a few months in Vienna my
                    mother and I managed to join him. The person who carried me across the border
                    returned to Czechoslovakia and was captured and arrested on a subsequent
                    crossing. In Vienna, he and my mother took a photograph which I still have
                    showing how I was taken across the border on his back. My mother also began a
                    diary where she recounted the escape in some detail. I hope to translate it for
                    my daughters at some point.</p>
                <p>We ended up in 1950 as refugees in Z�rich, Switzerland, and we lived for about a
                    year trying to find an onward destination. The Swiss at the time were hospitable
                    to temporary refugees but wanted us to move on as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Swiss try to keep themselves out of the refugee
                        business because of where they are. I understand that. They would be
                        submerged. Do you recall any of that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Vaguely. I remember some friends I played with in Z�rich where we lived.
                    My parents told me I picked up basic German, or rather Swiss German, fairly well
                    since children learn languages quickly but also forget them quickly. Sure
                    enough, I subsequently forgot it quickly, though some of it seemed to come back
                    when I studied it much later in graduate school, and later I learned it quite
                    well during assignments in Berlin and Vienna. But getting back to Switzerland,
                    my parents applied for emigration to the United States, Canada and Australia,
                    since the Swiss did want us to move on. My father had a congenital heart
                    condition, for which he was later operated in the U.S., and he did not pass the
                    physical for Canada which had a rule at the time that all refugee immigrants had
                    to spend two years working as laborers on farms. Australia was not favored by my
                    mother, who felt that the distance would make a return to Europe more difficult,
                    and the U.S. visa was not forthcoming. My parents still believed the Communist
                    government in Czechoslovakia would not last long and they would be able to go
                    home in a year or two. This led to the strange episode of our short immigration
                    to Morocco.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The French wanted Europeans to move to Morocco because there was growing
                    resistance to colonial rule, and many French were leaving. They wanted more
                    Europeans to populate the country and made immigration there very easy, and even
                    subsidized it. We took this up and traveled to Morocco in August 1950. We went
                    via boat from Marseille to Tangier, and then on to Casablanca. Almost
                    immediately, however, my mother got culture shock and became very depressed. At
                    the beginning of October, we returned to Switzerland before our Swiss visas
                    expired. The Swiss were not completely surprised to see us come back. But this
                    was an interlude that I remember because Casablanca, where we lived, was so
                    different from Europe. I remember markets with parrots and monkeys and things
                    like that—very exotic things for a young boy. When we returned to Zurich, my
                    parents submitted visa applications for other places, including New Zealand and
                    Venezuela, but still hoped for a U.S. visa. This finally came through in January
                    1951.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how this worked? Were you sponsored?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We were sponsored by a Czech fraternal organization from the Czech
                    diaspora in the United States. We did not have any relatives in the U.S., though
                    my father had a cousin in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We went from Le Havre in France to New York City by ship on the USS
                    Washington. I do remember watching from the deck as we arrived in New York
                    harbor, and my mother pointing out the Statue of Liberty to me. In retrospect
                    it's almost like a movie scene but it did happen, and I remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this, 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was May 15, 1951. My father always kept records of important dates. We
                    were met by a lady who was from the New York chapter of the Sokol organization
                    and taken to an apartment which initially we shared with another Czech family
                    that had come over at approximately the same time. It was in Astoria, in Queens,
                    right under the Triborough Bridge. But it was very convenient because it was
                    right across the street from an elementary school, PS 85, which I went to for
                    the next five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to this point I take it you hadn't had any
                        English?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PERINA: No, no. I didn't know any English and started school a year late. I was
                    six and a half when I began the first grade. I never went to kindergarten. I
                    recall that in my first two years of school I had special classes to learn
                    English pronunciation, especially the “th” in English which is one of the
                    hardest sounds for foreigners to pronounce. But I picked up the language rather
                    quickly, as kids do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your father and mother doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, my father had a first job washing dishes in a restaurant in
                    Manhattan, and it didn't work out very well because his English was not very
                    good. In his first week, he burned his hands with lye which he had mistaken for
                    soap. So he lost that job rather quickly. My mother went to work as a
                    housekeeper for the family of an older, successful Czech businessman. She later
                    worked in his company, which was an import-export business. My father got a job
                    as a waiter at the University Club in New York City, and he worked there for
                    about a year. Subsequently, because he knew some French, he got an office job
                    working for the French Line, the French steamship company that had ships going
                    across the Atlantic. He worked there until we left New York in 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself acting as the interpreter and all
                        for the family for the early part of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I don't recall that specifically because my parents did have to learn the
                    language, and I think they learned it fairly quickly, although I'm sure I
                    learned it faster. I think within a year or so I was pretty much into the kid
                    culture of the 1950's: trading cards, Captain Video, Davy Crockett, and all of
                    these things. One of the good things that my parents did was always to speak
                    with me in Czech. Sometimes parents try to help their kids by speaking English
                    with them at home, and usually this does not help kids learn the language but
                    leads them to forgetting their mother tongue. We always spoke Czech at home. I
                    still speak Czech with my mother today and in casual conversation speak it with
                    a native fluency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay in Astoria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We stayed in Astoria for about five years, almost to the point where we
                    got citizenship. But we had some friends— actually the family which for a few
                    weeks had shared the Astoria apartment with us— who moved to Cleveland, Ohio.
                    They wrote that the cost of housing was lower in Cleveland, jobs more plentiful,
                    and so on. We moved there in 1955, and we became U.S. citizens there in 1956. I
                    became a citizen through my parents when they were naturalized. I lived in
                    Cleveland until 1961 and then moved to Seattle with my mother.</p>

                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you recall of your time there, your
                        schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: By then I was fairly well Americanized. I went to junior high and the
                    first year and a half of high school in Cleveland. By that time I was a fairly
                    regular American kid. I do remember, however, a very large, active Czech
                    community in Cleveland. My parents became involved in it, and the family's
                    social life was primarily with other Czechs. It taught me the remarkable
                    strength and resilience of ethnic communities in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: He became what was then called a time study engineer, which would now be
                    a type of efficiency expert for a production line. He worked for a company named
                    Elwell Parker in Cleveland. My mother became a secretary in a company called
                    Gibson Homans, which produced paints and varnishes. Eventually, my father
                    learned to be a tax auditor and got a job with the city of Cleveland. He
                    remained in Cleveland for the rest of his life and retired as the head of the
                    tax collection department for the city of Cleveland. My mother later retired as
                    a procurement officer for the U.S. Air Force. In hindsight, I respect very much
                    how hard they worked in America and how well they did, considering where they
                    started. Certainly they had much more difficult lives than I can even imagine. I
                    reaped the benefits of their emigration from Europe to America.</p>
                <p>I should mention one thing which proved to be important for my parents in later
                    years, although we had no idea of it at the time. At the time that my parents
                    got their U.S. citizenship in 1956, there was a lapse in the consular agreement
                    between the United States and Czechoslovakia. The old consular agreement had
                    expired and there were negotiations on a new agreement but, in the Cold War
                    environment, they moved very slowly. There was a period of a year or two when
                    there was no bilateral consular agreement. Many years later, after the Communist
                    government in Czechoslovakia finally did collapse, we learned that because of
                    this my parents had never lost their Czech citizenship under Czechoslovak law.
                    Because of this, after the fall of the Communists, my father was entitled to
                    restitution of his property. Indeed, he eventually got his original family house
                    back because he was still considered a Czech citizen under Czech law. No one
                    imagined before 1989 that something like that would ever happen.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PERINA: I remember certain things being discussed in the family, such as the
                    Hungarian Uprising in 1956. I remember that it sparked this hope in the Czech
                    community that the Communist system was finally collapsing, as many still
                    expected. Afterwards, of course, there was criticism in the �migr� community
                    that the United States did not do more to help the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that after Cleveland you went to Seattle. Where
                        did you live in Seattle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: After all they had gone through together, my parents divorced in 1961,
                    and I moved with my mother to Seattle, where she remarried. We lived in south
                    Seattle near Seward Park and Lake Washington, and I went to Franklin High
                    School. I had not always been a good student, and I had some difficult years,
                    particularly in junior high school where I received some C's and once even a D.
                    But then in the 9th grade I had this realization that I was being categorized as
                    a mediocre student. It made me angry. I became serious about school and got
                    straight A's from the 10th grade to the 12th. I graduated as valedictorian out
                    of a class of some 600 students. I remember my commencement address where I
                    spoke about the lure of travel and exploring other countries. I had a great
                    desire, from high school onward, to see other parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find particularly from elementary school up
                        through your time in Seattle any types of books that were particularly
                        important to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I began greatly to enjoy travel books and adventure books, and also
                    historical fiction. I also became very interested in Europe, where I felt I had
                    roots. In 1961, when my parents were getting divorced, they sent me for the
                    summer to Europe. They were going through all the court proceedings and thought
                    it better if I would be away. They sent me for the summer to study French in a
                    school in Switzerland. It was my first trip to Europe. I was 16 years old and I
                    traveled alone. It was quite unusual at that time for a 16-year-old kid to be
                    sent alone to Europe, and subsequently the Cleveland Plain Dealer even carried
                    an article about it. I went from New York by boat, which at that time was still
                    cheaper than flying, and I think my father got a discount for me through his
                    previous employment with the French Line. I arrived in Le Havre France and then
                    went by train to Paris, Munich, Venice, Milan and Geneva, spending a few days in
                    each city. Then I spent two months learning French in a boarding school in a
                    little Swiss town called Les Diablerets, near Lausanne. It was a formative
                    experience and instilled in me further desire to travel and see the world.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, I was. I always assumed that I would go to a university. I almost
                    always assumed that I would go to graduate school and, I always thought I would
                    end up as a university professor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember where your family fell politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, they were conservative. They were anti-Communist and Republican
                    their whole lives. Most of the post-war emigration from Communist countries was
                    closer to the Republicans than to the Democrats. It was a generational thing.
                    There was an earlier, pre-war Czech immigration which was more economic than
                    political, and it was closer to the Democrats. But my parents and most of their
                    friends were Republicans because the Republican Party was seen as being more
                    anti-Communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: In 1963. I graduated from high school and got a full tuition scholarship
                    from the University of Chicago. It was much more of a stipend than anything I
                    was offered elsewhere. The College had a good reputation, and I liked the idea
                    of living in a big city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the University of Chicago when you were
                        there? Was it still under the shadow of Hutchins, the Great Books and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>PERINA: Very much so. The school considered itself very intellectual and serious.
                    Some people took themselves a bit too seriously, but in general it really was a
                    very stimulating environment. In retrospect, I particularly value the emphasis
                    it gave to general education. There were almost no electives in the first two
                    years, and one had to take core courses in all the major disciplines of the
                    humanities and sciences. In what seemed like a throwback to English prep
                    schools, there was even a mandatory swimming class to ensure that everyone knew
                    how to swim. But I received exposure to certain things like art appreciation and
                    music appreciation that I had never studied before, and really these courses
                    have enriched my life ever since. In retrospect, I am very grateful that I
                    received such an education. It also helped me to decide on a major. I was always
                    interested in the social sciences and humanities rather than natural science,
                    but that still leaves many majors from which to choose. I went through
                    anthropology, psychology, and sociology for various periods. In the end,
                    however, I settled on history because I saw it as the broadest discipline of all
                    the social sciences, and I always resisted the idea of narrowing my focus.
                    History gave me the broadest set of options and the best general education. I
                    must say that to this day I have no regret that I chose history as a major. As I
                    get older I appreciate history more and see it as the source of all other
                    knowledge. Studying and relating to previous generations also provides a certain
                    spiritual transcendence and comfort which I never found in religion.</p>

                <p>PERINA: Well, European history. It was partly a way of discovering my roots,
                    which was a popular thing for people to do then. Even though I enjoyed history
                    of all regions, I gravitated toward the history of that part of the world from
                    which I came, basically Central Europe and Bohemia.</p>

                    when they agreed to send me there. Marxism at the time was fashionable in
                    academia, among both students and professors. But I think it was good for me to
                    go into this environment. It did expose me to new ideas and other ways of
                    thinking. Many children of �migr�s never escape from the ethnic communities and
                    worldviews of their parents. I knew many such kids. I started becoming more
                    liberal than my parents while in high school. At Chicago, I think I developed a
                    good balance in my political views. Basically, I became suspicious of all
                    political extremism and radicalism, whether right-wing or left-wing. It is a
                    position I have held all of my life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at the University of Chicago, did diplomacy
                        cross your mind at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Never. I always thought I would be a university professor, and I never
                    imagined that I would go into diplomacy. I never focused on the Foreign Service
                    and knew little about it. I felt that as a first generation immigrant, I would
                    be an unlikely candidate to gain entry, pass security requirements, and so on.
                    It was only years later in graduate school, when Henry Kissinger became
                    prominent in foreign policy, that I first recognized that being foreign-born did
                    not exclude me from being a U.S. diplomat. That was the first time I even
                    considered it as an option.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the civil rights movement in that period impact at all
                        on you at the University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, yes, both in Chicago and later at Columbia. These were periods of
                    enormous social change in America, and one could not avoid issues like civil
                    rights, particularly on urban campuses in Chicago and New York. I was a
                    supporter of the civil rights movement, as were most students on campus. The
                    other big issue was, of course, Vietnam. It was on these issues that my
                    political views began to diverge from that of my parents and of the �migr�
                    community. Most Czech �migr�s supported the Vietnam War because it was a war
                    against communism. I became very skeptical of the war very quickly. I remember
                    all of the debates on campus about the draft, student deferments and so on. All
                    of these things raised my political consciousness, as was the case with much of
                    my generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you subject to the draft?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, first I had a student deferment, while those existed. Then, while I
                    was in college, there was an experiment with a lottery system based on
                    birthdays, and my birthday was in the bottom half, meaning I was far from being
                    called up. I was summoned to take a physical exam later, while in graduate
                    school at Columbia, and I flunked because of a congenital heart murmur I
                    inherited from my father. So I was put into a category that would be called up
                    only if the Russians were on Long Island. But I certainly had friends who were
                    drafted and some who were killed in Vietnam.</p>

                        means graduate school. How did you pick Columbia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I applied to a number of schools but received the most financial
                    assistance from Columbia. They offered me a fellowship which covered tuition
                    plus a living stipend and was, not surprisingly, federally-funded to train
                    foreign area experts, particularly on communist countries. By that time, I had
                    started focusing on Eastern Europe as an area of interest, and Columbia had a
                    very good program and reputation in this field. In addition, it offered the
                    attraction of being in New York City, which was very much the “Big Apple” and
                    place to be at the time. So I was very happy to be going there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Columbia from 1967 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was enrolled at Columbia from 1967 until I finished my Ph.D.
                    dissertation in 1977 during my first tour in Ottawa, Canada. Also, from 1970 to
                    1972 I lived overseas, in Munich, Germany, doing the research for my
                    dissertation. I received what was called a Foreign Area Fellowship to do this
                    research, primarily at the library of Radio Free Europe in Munich. My
                    dissertation topic was very contemporary history. It was a history of political
                    dissent among Czechoslovak intellectuals from 1950 to 1969, that is from the
                    Stalinist years through the Prague Spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you elaborate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well more specifically my dissertation was the history of this newspaper
                    called Literarni noviny, which was the Czech equivalent of the Literaturnaya
                    gazeta in Moscow. It was the most prominent newspaper of writers and
                    intellectuals. It was founded in 1952, in the Stalinist period, and remained the
                    most prominent voice of intellectuals through the 1968 Prague Spring until 1969,
                    when it was shut down by the government. The topic was interesting because I
                    could chart the evolution of the newspaper from Stalinism until the Prague
                    Spring, when it was one of the major proponents of reform. I got into this topic
                    partly because during my first year at Columbia, during the Prague Spring,
                    someone called the University and asked if there were any experts on
                    Czechoslovakia who could serve as consultants on a documentary film being
                    planned. The call was passed on to me and I followed up on it. It came from a
                    small, private film company called Saturday House Incorporated that wanted to
                    break into independent production of documentaries. I later learned that the
                    whole company was sort of a tax write-off for a very wealthy New York
                    convertible bond financier who had always wanted to be a film producer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was while The Prague Spring was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, this was in April 1968 when the Prague Spring was beginning to be in
                    the U.S. news. To make a long story short, I met with the company President, and
                    he offered me the job of going to Czechoslovakia with him and the film crew as a
                    consultant and interpreter. We spent about six weeks during April and May doing
                    something like 60 hours of interviews with politicians, academics, dissidents,
                    people on the street, anyone who would speak with us. Among those whom we
                    interviewed was the young Vaclav Havel who was then a dissident writer but
                    destined, as you know, to become President some three decades later. We didn't
                    interview Dubcek but we got film footage of him, and we interviewed the Foreign
                    Minister Jiri Hajek, the economic minister Ota Sik, and many others involved in
                    the reform movement. All of the footage, I think, comprised the most
                    comprehensive collection of interviews about the Prague Spring available
                    anywhere. What happened then was that we returned to New York and started
                    editing the 60 hours of film into a one-hour documentary. The idea was that it
                    would then be offered for sale to one of the networks or perhaps PBS. Such
                    independent productions were more common then than they are today, when networks
                    basically do their own documentaries. But as we were finishing the film, the
                    Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia came on August 21, 1968. This event
                    raised interest in the Prague Spring, but, unfortunately, the networks wanted
                    footage of the invasion and the tanks rather than of what led up to these
                    events. So suddenly our film was overtaken by events and became history,
                    literally. We did still make a documentary that was shown in a few theaters and
                    also on some PBS stations around the country, but it was never purchased by a
                    network. I have a copy of it, which is now probably one of the few in existence,
                    perhaps the only one. I am still friends with the fellow who headed the company,
                    and he told me in later years that the outtakes, the entire 60 or so hours of
                    film, were lost when the company dissolved. However, the whole experience gave
                    me an opportunity to really get acquainted with the dynamics and personalities
                    of the Prague Spring and was surely a factor in my choice of dissertation
                    topic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought there would be some resistance from
                        the History Department. I mean you're getting too close to the present time

                        this resistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, it was unusual and pushed the envelope even in the field of
                    contemporary history. But my two primary sponsors at Columbia were also modern
                    historians who had written on relatively recent themes so I got away with it.
                    Still, my topic was about as contemporary as you can get for a historian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in the middle of the Prague Spring and doing
                        this interviewing, did you get a feel for whether this reform process would
                        last?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, we interviewed many dissident groups and intellectuals, and I did
                    start to formulate some ideas on the dynamics of reform in authoritarian
                    societies. My primary thesis, which I later elaborated in the dissertation, was
                    that sustained reform in this part of the world must come from the top down
                    rather than from the bottom up. In other words, dissidents and reformist
                    intellectuals can help to create reformist politicians, but they cannot
                    substitute for them. Real change must come from the political level. I think
                    this was seen in the Prague Spring itself, which would not have happened without
                    Dubcek. Of course, at the time, it was hard to imagine that a Gorbachev would
                    appear in the Soviet Union and completely change that system and the entire
                    Communist bloc as well. I think my thesis did not diminish the role of
                    intellectuals in articulating the need for reform. It just argued that the
                    reform could not really happen without political backing from above.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But looking at Czechoslovakia, the pressure for reform
                        really did came from the intellectual core rather than other places where
                        you have it coming from shipyards, as in Poland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Intellectuals did create the environment for change, but you needed
                    someone like Dubcek to make it happen. It was very similar to what subsequently
                    happened with Gorbachev. Dubcek was a party apparatchik, a career member of the
                    party. No one expected that he would have such reformist views after he came to
                    power, just like no one expected Gorbachev to do the things he did. In fact,
                    both leaders were chosen by their respective communist parties because they were
                    seen as safe choices that would not rock the boat. Had it been known that they
                    would be such reformers, they never would have become Party leaders. This is why
                    Kremlinology was so difficult. If the Party colleagues of Dubcek and Gorbachev
                    could not predict how these leaders would behave once they gained power, how
                    could analysts in Washington predict it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go through a period of depression after the
                        Soviets moved in? I mean, this must have been pretty depressing since you
                        had been so involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. It was very disappointing although in some respects not surprising
                    because some of the things that were going on in Czechoslovakia really were
                    getting out of control from the Soviet viewpoint, and poor Dubcek was playing
                    with fire. But it also showed the fallacy of the Marxist view that the
                    individual is not important in history and all things are determined by larger
                    social forces. Dubcek, just like Gorbachev later, was essential to the changes
                    that happened in his country. One can argue that perhaps these changes were
                    inevitable, but it still could have been 10 years or 100 years before they
                    happened. Everything I have learned in my study of history reinforces a sense of
                    how individual leaders are important, and what an enormous impact good
                    leadership or bad leadership has on the fate of countries. I think this is
                    something which I saw also throughout my Foreign Service career, not just with
                    Gorbachev but also, for example, in Yugoslavia where a collection of bad leaders
                    led that country toward disaster. I saw it reflected in other things as well.
                    For example, when I was in college the place where everyone expected a
                    disastrous civil war was South Africa, and no one expected an F.W. de Klerk and
                    Nelson Mandela would emerge and save that country from disaster. The quality of
                    leadership and individual leaders plays a great role in history, sometimes to
                    the good and sometimes, like in Yugoslavia, to the bad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the mood at Columbia during your years there? Did

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I don't think it had that much impact only because so much else was going
                    on. 1968 was an incredible year. Columbia was in a tumultuous state because of
                    Vietnam and the civil rights movement. There was also the assassination of
                    Martin Luther King, student demonstrations in France and Robert Kennedy's
                    assassination. The Prague Spring wasn't the number one issue on most people's
                    radar scopes, but we had many demonstrations at Columbia on other issues, and
                    thanks to some of these I in fact met my future wife.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PERINA: My wife's maiden name is Ethel Ott Hetherington, she is from Dallas,
                    Texas and of Anglo-Saxon and Swiss German heritage. We met in the aftermath of
                    the student demonstrations at Columbia in 1968 that shut the University down.
                    You may remember the name Mark Rudd who led these demonstrations. A number of
                    classes were cancelled and shifted to the apartments of students. My future wife
                    was the roommate of one of my classmates who hosted a class in her apartment .We
                    dated on and off for several years and then we got married in Salzburg, when I
                    had my fellowship. I received a Foreign Area Fellowship to do research on my
                    dissertation in Munich, Germany which had the best archives on Communist
                    Czechoslovakia through Radio Free Europe and also through something called the
                    Collegium Carolinum which was basically a Sudeten German organization that
                    collected everything that was published in Czechoslovakia after 1945. So I went
                    to Munich for two years on this fellowship, from 1970 to 1972. Ethel came to
                    Europe during this time and we were married in Salzburg on May 26, 1972. We
                    found out that in Austria, with its socialist traditions, the cost of a civil
                    marriage was a percentage of one's income. Since I had a fellowship and a very
                    small income, we got married for about $30 in a beautiful castle in Salzburg,
                    the Schloss Mirabelle. It was a small but very nice wedding.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PERINA: I found Munich a very pleasant city. We were there during the 1972
                    Olympics and the tragedy that happened to members of the Israeli Olympic team,
                    who were taken hostage and killed by Palestinian terrorists. There was one other
                    incident, of a very different kind, that I recall. I did most of my research at
                    Radio Free Europe. There was a Czech broadcaster at the Radio who was sort of
                    our age, a young fellow who had left Czechoslovakia after 1968. His name was
                    Pavel Minarik. He became very friendly toward us. He had a very nice German
                    wife, and we went to movies a couple of times with them and so on. When we were
                    back in New York and I was finishing up my dissertation and teaching the Western
                    Civilization course in Columbia College, he even visited us once and we had
                    dinner together. I always assumed he was just a friendly fellow, perhaps
                    interested at some point in immigrating to America and wanting to keep up his
                    contacts. Well, some years later, after I joined the Foreign Service and was on
                    my first tour in Ottawa, I was reading the newspaper and suddenly saw a short
                    report that a Czech employee of Radio Free Europe had appeared at a press
                    conference in Prague where he attacked Radio Free Europe and said he had worked
                    there for five years as a spy for the Czechoslovak intelligence services. It was
                    Pavel Minarik. He was treated as a hero by the Czech government and gave
                    numerous interviews and wrote articles about the alleged plots and evil deeds of
                    Radio Free Europe. There was subsequently a big debate at RFE about whether he
                    had always been a spy or simply struck a deal with the Czech intelligence
                    service in order to be able to return home. We now know that he indeed had been
                    a spy from the very beginning, sent out with the express purpose of infiltrating
                    Radio Free Europe and embarrassing it. He was truly a dastardly fellow because
                    his German wife knew nothing of his real purpose and was devastated when he left
                    her. As I understand, he still lives somewhere in the Czech Republic but keeps a
                    low profile. The whole episode was remarkable because it was my first experience
                    with how deceptive people can be in the world of espionage. But of course, I
                    still had no idea that I would join the diplomatic service and routinely deal
                    with intelligence issues through my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the Foreign Service come up for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, the Foreign Service came up when we moved back to New York from
                    Munich, and I was writing my dissertation and started sending out applications
                    for teaching jobs. Lo and behold, there were very few academic jobs around. Some
                    of my classmates said they sent out hundreds of applications with barely a
                    response. I was still writing the dissertation and saw little prospect of a
                    teaching job even after I was finished. We had some income, my wife worked at
                    Columbia University Press, and I had a teaching fellowship but a very small
                    income. Then my wife became pregnant, and I started making plans to work as a
                    cab driver in New York, like some of my classmates were already doing. Somewhere
                    on a bulletin board at Columbia I saw an ad to take the Foreign Service exam and
                    decided to try it. As I mentioned, the prominence at the time of Henry Kissinger
                    had started me thinking that perhaps a diplomatic career was not out of the
                    question, even for a foreign-born, first generation immigrant, but I had not
                    given it serious thought. Well I signed up for the exam, and I was as amazed as
                    anyone when I learned that I had passed. I don't think I passed it at a very
                    high level. I think I frankly I just made it but then I aced the oral
                    interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, I do recall the questions. But at that time the oral exam was very
                    different from what it is now. It was basically a conversation with a panel of
                    about five people. I walked into the room and chatted for about an hour. It was
                    very civilized. To prepare for it, I bought this little U.S. Government
                    publication that was a great summary of U.S. foreign policy positions. It was
                    one of these periodic reports that the Executive Branch has to prepare for
                    Congress on policy issues. It was the perfect thing to read, and I studied it
                    carefully. As a consequence I knew about things like the Shanghai Communiqu�,
                    which was completely out of my specialization in academia. I was in fact asked
                    about our China policy and referred to the Shanghai Communiqu� agreement that
                    there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of China. I think the panel was
                    impressed that as a European specialist I had heard of the Shanghai
                    Communiqu�.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>But then they asked me questions about the Watergate hearings which were then
                    underway. They asked me what I thought of them and how I hoped they would turn
                    out. I sensed right away they wanted to see if I was going to be partisan, if I
                    was going to say, “Well, Nixon should be hanged” or “Poor Nixon, he's being
                    persecuted.” So I answered by saying I hoped that it would all end in a way that
                    didn't divide the country even more than Vietnam ever did. It was clearly the
                    right answer, the right diplomatic answer for better or for worse. I didn't tip
                    my hand. I guess it was the thing that they wanted to hear and then they asked,
                    “Well, what happens if the President gets impeached?” And I said, “Well, then
                    there's an impeachment trial by Congress” and then they said, “What appeal is
                    there from that trial?” I thought for a minute if it was a trick question
                    because the answer was of course very simple. I said, “None. There's no appeal
                    from the results of the trial.” So I think they were satisfied that I at least
                    knew the basics of the Constitution. The oral went very well. I think I hit it
                    off with the board. I found out subsequently that I scored very high on the
                    oral, and this was the main reason why I got a letter very shortly afterward
                    that I had been accepted and that they were starting the security investigation.
                    I was somewhat worried about my heart murmur, which had kept me out of the
                    draft, but during my physical exam it did not seem to be any problem for the
                    State Department. I was in the Foreign Service, I think, within a few months. It
                    went amazingly quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1974 you came into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, November 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You want to talk a little about your initial impression of
                        your class and how you felt about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, I was very happy to come into the Foreign Service because in the
                    first instance I was happy to have a job. My wife was pregnant, and the first
                    thing we checked was if the medical benefits covered pre-existing pregnancy.
                    They did so we were relieved. I was also very happy because writing my
                    dissertation I had grown a little tired of academia. I grew tired of the
                    specialization and increasingly narrowing focus. Though I was determined to
                    finish the dissertation, and eventually I did, I was excited about being in
                    something new and different like the Foreign Service. It was viewed as
                    prestigious by my friends and family, it was more competitive to enter, it
                    actually paid better than an entry-level job in academia, and I particularly
                    looked forward to the adventure of living overseas. I felt well qualified for
                    the Service: I knew other languages, had lived overseas and so on. So I was
                    quite enthusiastic about it, and my wife was also. She had lived as an exchange
                    student in Berlin, spoke German, also enjoyed being overseas, and of course was
                    relieved that I had finally gotten a job. We came down from New York, lived in
                    Arlington Towers which is where the Foreign Service Institute was at the time,
                    and met our class which was about 35 people or so.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Then I started negotiating my first assignment. This was, of course, before open
                    assignments existed, so it was like a poker game because one had to try to
                    figure out first what was available and how often one could say no before the
                    offers got worse rather than better. I learned very quickly how one has to watch
                    out and negotiate in the assignments process. During my first assignment
                    meeting, the counselor said, “We're going to make you a principal officer.” I
                    could not believe that as a new officer I would be a principal officer. I said,
                    “Where?” And he said, “Bukavu,” in the Congo, a consulate, a one man consulate
                    and I would be principal officer. I looked at him and said, “Do you know I have
                    a pregnant wife?” He said, “That's why you're perfect. There's no school
                    problem.” So I learned very quickly to be careful of what assignment counselors
                    try to sell. I held out and in the end was offered a rotational assignment in
                    Ottawa, Canada. This wasn't the most exotic place to go but I concluded that
                    with a child on the way and still trying to finish a dissertation, it made a lot
                    of practical sense. Certainly more so than Bukavu. The consequence was that in
                    our first two years in the Foreign Service, the furthest we got from Washington
                    was on home leave to California. But we were in fact very fortunate. Ottawa
                    turned out to be a very interesting and pleasant place to live. And very
                    significant in our lives because both of our daughters, Kaja or Katherine and
                    Alexandra, were born there about 17 months apart. I even finished my
                    dissertation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the class again. What was the composition
                        in terms of ethnicity, gender and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was a mixed group but an impressive group. There were, as I recall, a
                    fair number of women in the class. It surely wasn't 50-50 but I would say it was
                    about a third women. Racially, there were one or two African-Americans, one
                    Hispanic, but as I recall no Asians. It was certainly an impressive group and
                    very collegial. In fact, the spouses of the group gave my wife a shower in
                    Arlington Towers, a baby shower, which was an introduction to the sense of
                    community in the Foreign Service which we came very much to value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to parlay your doctorate into anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No, I quickly found out that Ph.D.'s were neither rare nor particularly
                    valued. Academic degrees were not really taken into account very much. I
                    finished my dissertation mainly out of principle and as an insurance policy if I
                    left the Foreign Service, but it never helped me much in the bureaucracy. Later
                    I found out that education levels were actually hidden from promotion boards.
                    What I did get credit for were the languages I knew. I tested and received step
                    increases for Czech, German and French. That put me at the top of my pay grade
                    so I started out at about $13,000 a year, which we were very happy with. I had
                    the highest salary in my class.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ten years before I started out at about $3,500. That
                        wasn't bad. $10,000 was the top government salary. So you were in Ottawa
                        from 1975 to 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: 1975 to late 1976. We arrived in Ottawa in February 1975 after I had
                    taken the A-100 and the consular course. This was a rotational assignment so I
                    did both consular work and political/economic work, but primarily it was
                    consular. Canadians, of course, do not need visas but there were a lot of
                    third-country applicants in Ottawa and also a lot of complex citizenship cases,
                    plus imprisoned Americans. I worked on all of these. It was the only consular
                    work I have done in my career but it left memories of some very interesting
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, I recall one in particular that was when I gave the first visa to
                    the United States to Alexander Solzhenitsyn who had just been expelled from the
                    Soviet Union a few months earlier. He was invited to Canada before he was
                    invited to the United States. He came to Canada and while there he got an
                    invitation from the AFL/CIO to speak in Washington at some convention they were
                    holding. He decided to accept and we received word that he was going to come to
                    apply for a visa. Somebody from the AFL/CIO tipped us off that this was going to
                    happen. I was the junior officer and my boss was a more experienced consular
                    officer so we sat down and we thought about this for a minute. Right away we
                    realized that he would need a waiver for Communist Party membership, which
                    applied to anyone who had ever been in the Communist Party, as Solzhenitsyn had
                    been in his youth. We thought, well, this is Solzhenitsyn, a renowned writer and
                    dissident and very much of a hero to the Western world. We phoned Washington to
                    ask if we could get around the waiver requirement in some way, and the answer
                    was no. We had to go through the whole process of him filling out all the
                    applications, sending these to Washington, and getting approval for the visa
                    issuance.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I remember my boss was very worried about how Solzhenitsyn would take this.
                    Solzhenitsyn had a reputation of standing up to bureaucrats, and we could
                    imagine him getting fed up with the forms, walking out of the Embassy and
                    denouncing American bureaucrats as no better than Soviet ones. Well,
                    Solzhenitsyn came in with his wife Marina, who was his second wife, and was very
                    polite and friendly. I did most of the talking with him even though I didn't
                    know Russian at the time but I did know German. He spoke German quite well, and
                    that is how we communicated. I explained to him that he had to fill out these
                    forms, and his reaction was the opposite of what my boss had feared.
                    Solzhenitsyn took the process more seriously than almost any other applicant I
                    had processed. He sat down with these forms and began filling them out
                    meticulously. There was one standard question asking for a list of all places
                    where the applicant had lived for more than six months since the age of 18. He
                    started filling this out and then he turned to me and said, “Do I have to fill
                    in all the labor camps?” And I said, “No, you don't have to. Just cover the
                    period. You don't have to fill in all the labor camps.” He was immensely
                    conscientious about the entire process. I thought about it afterwards and
                    concluded that his behavior actually made a lot of sense, given his experiences.
                    If you spend your life fighting a bureaucracy, your first thought is not to make
                    a mistake in an official document that the bureaucracy can use against you. So
                    he took the matter very seriously. We obtained the waiver from Washington
                    overnight, and he came back the next day to pick up the visas. I know the exact
                    date, which was May 21, 1975, because he also autographed and dated a first
                    edition, in Russian, of the Gulag Archipelago for me. That was the date of his
                    first visa to the United States, although he subsequently came many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He eventually settled in Vermont, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. He eventually settled there but then returned to Moscow after the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that period of the '70s and during our involvement in
                        Vietnam there were a significant number of young Americans males who entered
                        Canada to avoid the draft. Did that affect you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not in general, but there was this amazing coincidence where I met a
                    classmate from the University of Chicago on the street in Ottawa. He was in
                    Canada because he had gone AWOL (absent without leave) from the army before
                    deployment to Vietnam. He was not a draft evader because he was beyond the
                    draft. It was a very strange feeling at first because there we met and he was in
                    a sense running from the United States and I was representing the United States.
                    But after a while it really did not influence our personal relationship. We
                    became good friends and still are. He is an attorney in Ottawa but was amnestied
                    many years ago and can visit the U.S. without problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Canadians you met? I have been told by some
                        people the one thing that binds Canadians together is that they are not
                        Americans and of course, sometimes being an American diplomat there means
                        bearing the brunt of hearing why they're Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Right. Well, it is a dilemma because you have to be sensitive to their
                    desire to have a separate identity despite the fact that so much of the culture
                    and the economy is dominated by U.S. influence, as they are the first to
                    recognize. It's always tricky because when Canadians ask you, “Well, how do you
                    like it here?” you don't want to say, “Well, it's just like home,” even though
                    in many respects it is. But in fact we found the Canadians very hospitable. We
                    had two daughters born in Ottawa, both delivered by the same doctor who
                    delivered Margaret Trudeau's children, so for that and other reasons it will
                    always be a special place for us. We made Canadian friends with whom we stay in
                    touch to the present day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any sort of hostility? I think of Qu�bec and
                        the English-French issue. Did you get caught up in that in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, there was some resentment of the U.S., of course. Not so much as a
                    result of the French issue but rather because of our enormous influence and the
                    Canadian wish to develop a separate identity. Unfortunately, some Canadians felt
                    that a Canadian identity could not develop unless U.S. influence was restricted
                    and closed off. I did a little bit of work in the political and economic
                    sections of the Embassy. In the economic section, the main problems were
                    Canadian efforts to restrict American TV broadcasts, to somehow limit American
                    content in books and magazines, and so on. We argued that it would not work, as
                    for the most part it did not. Many Canadians enjoyed American TV programs more
                    than CBC programs. It is very hard to legislate a cultural identity, as some
                    people tried to do. At the same time, I think Canadians are genuinely different
                    from Americans in many respects and do have their own identity. One of my jobs
                    in the political section was to attend question period in the Canadian
                    Parliament. The Prime Minister at the time was Pierre Trudeau, and he was a
                    master of debate. Watching him and Diefenbaker spar in parliament was a
                    pleasure. It was a very civilized political culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was there with two ambassadors. When I first arrived, the ambassador
                    was William Porter, with whom I overlapped only a bit, and he was then replaced
                    by Thomas Enders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Vietnam War, there was quite a bit of tension
                        between Trudeau and Lyndon Johnson. Did you get any sense of that during
                        your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PERINA: By the time I got to Ottawa the Vietnam War was basically over. It was no
                    longer as controversial as in years past. So no, I did not get any sense of
                    that. But of course Trudeau was a strong leader, intelligent and unafraid to
                    speak out when he felt like it, so I have no doubt he made some in Washington
                    nervous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left Ottawa in late '76 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Exactly, we left in the winter of 1976 with two young daughters in tow. I
                    got a job here in Washington. Everyone was telling me that that was the smart
                    thing to do early-on in a career, to learn how the bureaucracy works. It was a
                    little frustrating because I had joined the Foreign Service to see the world but
                    had not seen much of it yet. But I received what was considered a very good
                    assignment in EUR/RPM, or the regional political-military office of the European
                    Bureau. It was essentially the NATO desk in the State Department. It was a desk
                    for NATO but also for what was then the CSCE, later to become OSCE, which I
                    became very involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you elaborate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, the CSCE was the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
                    a process created by the Helsinki Final Act which was signed in 1975 by 33
                    European countries plus the U.S. and Canada. The document had a lot of human
                    rights-related provisions, the famous Basket III, and Congress became very
                    interested in their implementation. A joint legislative-executive Helsinki
                    Commission was in fact created on the Hill, and Congress asked for semiannual
                    reports from the President on how Helsinki Final Act provisions were being
                    implemented. My job turned out to be drafting those reports. A friend of mine,
                    Jon Greenwald, drafted the first one, and I drafted the subsequent four. These
                    were actually quite lengthy reports. They ranged from 70 to 100 pages and were
                    basically a tabulation of events in the Eastern bloc related to CSCE
                    implementation, things like treatment of dissidents, human rights violations,
                    freedom of the press, freedom of movement and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>There was a lot of interest in these reports, and they were attacked by the
                    Eastern bloc countries as soon as they were published, so it was important to be
                    accurate. It was actually a heady experience for a second-tour junior officer to
                    be drafting these long documents that were then released in the name of the
                    President. One interesting tidbit was that the first report I drafted was under
                    Jimmy Carter, who was inaugurated just as I returned to Washington. We had to
                    send the report to the NSC for clearance, and, amazingly, when it came back
                    there were these pencil notations in the margins that we were told came from the
                    President himself. Jimmy Carter had personally read the 70 or so page report. No
                    one could believe it, and I am sure it was a fluke only because he was new to
                    the job. He did not read subsequent reports because his staffers were more
                    experienced and did not pass stuff like this to him. But it was consistent with
                    what we heard about Jimmy Carter—that he was very hands-on, meticulous, and
                    would study in detail anything that people put in front of him.</p>
                <p>The most interesting thing in this period was that I attended part of the first
                    CSCE follow-up meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. This was in late 1977 and early
                    1978. In the Helsinki Final Act it said that periodically there would be
                    follow-up meetings to see how the document was being implemented. The first such
                    meeting was held in Belgrade, and the head of our delegation was Arthur
                    Goldberg, a very prominent and senior figure. The Soviet ambassador was Yuri
                    Vorontsov, who later became a deputy foreign minister and ambassador to
                    Washington and had the reputation of being a very tough guy. With the
                    personalities of Goldberg and Vorontsov, and the prominence of human rights in
                    Jimmy Carter's foreign policy, Belgrade had all the ingredients for a clash
                    between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This in fact happened.</p>
                <p>I wasn't on the delegation the whole time but I was there for probably about half
                    of the conference in 1978. There was a debate within our delegation and later
                    within the NATO caucus on whether Western delegations should name names of
                    dissidents in the Soviet Union. The Soviets considered just the subject of human
                    rights to be interference in internal affairs, and naming names of specific
                    dissidents like Natan Sharansky or Yuri Orlov was unprecedented and seen by some
                    of our allies as too provocative. Many of our European friends were concerned
                    that the Soviets might use it as an excuse to walk out of the conference and
                    thus kill the entire CSCE process. Goldberg mulled the issue over and decided
                    that he would name names. We prepared a speech where he referred to several
                    prominent dissidents, including Sharansky and Orlov, whose names were known in
                    the West. I remember when he delivered the speech in the plenary how everyone
                    held their breath on how the Soviets would react. Well, they denounced the
                    speech but did not walk out of the meeting. They stayed but maintained their
                    argument that this was not a legitimate discussion topic and that it was
                    interference in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union. Of course, when
                    Goldberg read his statement, the Soviets knew of it in advance and Vorontsov
                    himself didn't attend. He sent his deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>These Basket III issues dominated the whole meeting. There were also many less
                    prominent names, particularly of refuseniks, which we were asked by Congress and
                    others to raise with the Soviets. We had a list of several hundred names which
                    we could not raise orally in the meeting. So we attached the names to a
                    diplomatic note which we sent to the Soviet delegation. The lists came back to
                    us seemingly unread with the notation that they were not an appropriate topic
                    for discussion between the United States and the Soviet Union. Basically, the
                    argument the Soviets tried at that time and for many years thereafter was to say
                    that this was not the business of the United States or any other country—that we
                    were interfering in their internal affairs. This was a very weak,
                    legalistic-type of argument which predictably did not work or deter the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Helsinki Accord did also have a provision on
                        interference in internal affairs, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, it did have such a provision. The Helsinki Final Act was a consensus
                    document, and thus it had a lot of internal contradictions, or at least
                    provisions open to very different interpretations. The thing to remember is that
                    it was a political document, and the entire review process was likewise very
                    political. We focused on certain principles, and the Soviets focused on others.
                    They would have wanted to use the CSCE gradually to weaken NATO and to create a
                    new European security system. We wanted to use the process to advance human
                    rights and overcome the division of Europe, weaken the Iron Curtain if you will.
                    It was a political debate, and the Soviets could not stop it with legalistic
                    arguments. They were in a much weaker position because the document put these
                    human rights issue on the diplomatic agenda, and they could not put the genie
                    back in the bottle. They could refuse to talk about these provisions, but they
                    could not stop others from talking about them.</p>
                <p>In subsequent years, one of my bosses, Jack Maresca, who worked on negotiation of
                    the Helsinki Final Act and wrote a book about the CSCE, said that the Soviets
                    considered walking out of the process a number of times but could not figure out
                    how to do it because of one provision in the so-called Blue Book, which
                    contained the rules of procedure of CSCE and was adopted with the Final Act.
                    This provision in the Blue Book said that no follow-up meeting would end until
                    it had determined the date and place of the next follow-up meeting. Thus if the
                    Soviets walked out, the meeting would technically never conclude and would be a
                    constant problem for them on the international agenda. It could go into recess
                    but then be called back whenever the West wanted to give Basket III issues
                    prominence again. So it was sort of a Catch 22. It in fact guaranteed the CSCE
                    perpetual life unless there was a new consensus to change the Blue Book
                    rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what a refusenik was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, a refusenik was basically someone who was being refused a visa to
                    emigrate from the Soviet Union, and by and large at that time it was primarily
                    Jewish emigrants who were trying to leave. There were also others, however, like
                    the Baptists who took refuge in the basement of our Moscow embassy for several
                    years and whom I met during my later tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what years did you work in this office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was in EUR/RPM from the winter of 1976 to the summer of 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for things happening in Eastern
                        Europe and in the Soviet Union at this time that would later lead to the
                        Velvet Revolution, the fall of the Berlin wall and the events of 1989? Did
                        you sense anything cooking there or was all of this still below the
                        surface?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I certainly did not expect the fall of communism ten years later, or even
                    in my lifetime. The 1989 events were anticipated by very few experts. But there
                    certainly were signs of growing dissent and dissatisfaction in Eastern bloc
                    countries. The Final Act was a perfect example. When it was adopted, the signing
                    countries all agreed that they would make efforts to publish and disseminate the
                    text to their publics. The Soviets did in fact publish it widely, probably
                    thinking that the Basket III provisions would get no more attention than human
                    rights agreements within the UN and elsewhere. But then suddenly, all of these
                    Helsinki monitoring groups began appearing in the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc
                    countries, much to the surprise of the governments. In fact, Western governments
                    were also surprised by this; no one expected such a reaction. Partly, the timing
                    worked well with the advent of Jimmy Carter's presidency and his emphasis on
                    human rights, but it also showed a much higher level of frustration in Eastern
                    bloc countries than many realized, and also a higher level of readiness by
                    dissidents to challenge authority and vent this frustration. I found the
                    developments fascinating, and, of course, they did play into my interests from
                    academia and my dissertation. So I latched onto CSCE and stayed with it, on and
                    off, for the next 25 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a relatively new officer this frankly must have been a
                        hell of a lot of fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PERINA: It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed that assignment. Ironically, it was
                    the only State Department assignment that I had for about the next 20 years. My
                    subsequent Department of State assignment was as Senior Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary in 1996 because I spent so much of my career overseas and then in
                    Washington in the NSC (National Security Council) or just on training
                    assignments. But I made a lot of good contacts in that first State Department
                    job. I found out rather quickly that contacts are key to a career in the State
                    Department, that indeed it is a little bit like what Dick Holbrooke jokingly
                    said in later years in a commencement address: “Remember that what is important
                    in life is not who you know, it's whom you know.” I made contacts in that first
                    Washington job that got me through at least the next 20 years of my career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happens next in 1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: In 1978 I left RPM and went into a year of Russian training because I was
                    assigned to Moscow, to the political section in Embassy Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine this came from your European Bureau contacts
                        because Moscow was a hard club to get into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. It was going to the center of the action at that time. China was
                    just emerging, it was becoming a desirable assignment, but Moscow was still the
                    place to go. Ironically, I didn't know Russian. I had a lot of other languages
                    but I didn't have Russian so I had to go into a year of Russian training. Then
                    in the summer of '79 I went out to Moscow to work in what was called at the time
                    the External Political Section which followed Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your Czech and your German, how did Russian go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: With my Czech I had an advantage in Russian. At the beginning it's a
                    little confusing. If you're weak in one Slavic language it can really confuse
                    you to learn another Slavic language. But my Czech was strong enough that I was
                    able to keep them separate, and there are a lot of cognates. I did well in the
                    language training and had pretty good Russian by the time I went to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from 1979?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: From the summer of 1979 to the summer of 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Soviet Union in 1979 when
                        you got out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, this was pre-Afghanistan so our relations were still pretty good.
                    Jimmy Carter was the president and he put a great emphasis on human rights
                    issues, but in our overall relations with Moscow there was a lot of interaction,
                    a lot of exchanges and growing commercial relations. The invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia had been forgotten, and the effort to build d�tente was underway.
                    So it was an expanding bilateral relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our Ambassador was Thomas Watson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I had three chiefs of mission. When I just got there it was still Mack
                    Toon for about six months. Then he was replaced by Thomas Watson, the IBM
                    president. But then he left after about a year and was replaced by Jack Matlock,
                    who came not as ambassador but as Charg� d'Affaires between ambassadors. The
                    most significant event during my tour is obvious. I got there around September
                    1979, and three months later the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. I do have a story
                    about that. The invasion came at Christmas time, and it so happened that
                    everybody was on leave for the holidays, even the DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission)
                    was gone and the Political Counselor, Bob German, was in charge of the Embassy.
                    It was the same thing in the Russian Foreign Ministry, or so they claimed. They
                    told us after the invasion that the Foreign Minister was out of town but I doubt
                    it. He just did not want to meet. So the Deputy Foreign Minister was in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>In any case, we received word a few days before Christmas that Washington had
                    noticed these strange military movements along the Soviet border with
                    Afghanistan, and we were instructed to go in with a demarche to try to find out
                    what was happening. Bob German delivered the demarche because everybody else was
                    on vacation, and he took me along as the note taker because I had the best
                    Russian in the Political Section. I'll always remember that session. We met with
                    Georgiy Korniyenko, who was First Deputy Foreign Minister. Bob German was a very
                    polite fellow and in a very friendly way he said that we had noticed these
                    apparent military movements on the border, and what is going on? And I remember
                    Korniyenko saying, “There's absolutely nothing going on, and if there were
                    something going on, it should be no subject of concern to the United States.” In
                    other words, he was saying that if something were happening, it was none of our
                    business. So we got this complete brick wall. I wrote up the telegram, and then
                    I think it may have been the next morning or no later than two days after that
                    suddenly we saw in the morning that Afghanistan had been invaded. The Soviets
                    were also justifying it all as helping Afghanistan stave off a coup attempt
                    engineered by the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). So it clearly did concern
                    the United States, contrary to what Korniyenko had told us, because there was
                    this effort to implicate us and in fact blame us for the whole thing. It amazed
                    me at how blatantly and unabashedly Korniyenko had lied to Bob German. There was
                    not the slightest effort by the Kremlin to reconcile what they told us before
                    the invasion and what they said publicly after the invasion. Both things were
                    totally in contradiction, and both were lies. It showed me for the first time
                    how unashamedly people can lie in diplomacy.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our initial analysis of this? I have never been
                        fully satisfied by explanations of why the Soviets invaded another Communist
                        country. It caused all sorts of developments which are still with us today.
                        One of the explanations I've heard is that it was a bunch of old men in the
                        Politburo who didn't know what they were doing. What was coming from our
                        Embassy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, the Soviets felt that Afghanistan was slipping away from them. The
                    invasion was a fundamental miscalculation and not a rational move from any
                    viewpoint. This in part explains why we ourselves were so surprised and caught
                    off guard by it. The best explanation is that the Soviets just totally
                    miscalculated at how difficult it would be to control the country. We couldn't
                    figure it out even with the reputation that by then the Soviets had. They were
                    willing to go into Hungary, they were willing to go into Czechoslovakia but
                    nobody anticipated that they would really go into Afghanistan. And I think that
                    really doubled the shock and then the desire to retaliate against them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened in the Embassy after the invasion? Did
                        all the doors shut on you or did you shut all the doors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, we were the ones who shut the doors, and it was a very intentional
                    response. Our Ambassador by then was Thomas Watson, and we junior officers
                    rotated sitting in on the morning Country Team meetings. I remember one dramatic
                    staff meeting just a few days after the invasion when Watson came in and said,
                    “We are going to retaliate. We are going to react very, very strongly to this
                    Soviet action. I want from each section chief and agency head a list of things
                    that we can do to the Soviets to show them how outraged we are.” This was at the
                    Country Team meeting. Then he asked right there for people around the table to
                    give him examples of what could be done to retaliate against the Soviets. It was
                    a very tense meeting because he then did call on people around the table. He
                    would go, for example, to the Cultural Attach�, to the USIA person. That person
                    would say, “Well, you know we have a lot of exchanges with the Soviets. We have
                    student exchanges, we have professional exchanges, and so on. We could stop all
                    these but it wouldn't be in our interest to do so because it took us a long time
                    to develop these programs. We would just be punishing the people who are going
                    to have greater exposure to the West. So I would not recommend that we do this.”
                    Then Watson went to the Economics Officer who said, “Well, we're selling a lot
                    of wheat now to the Soviet Union and we could stop selling that. However, there
                    is a lot of Congressional support for these sales. Farm interests want to
                    continue selling wheat. We will get a lot of flack if we stop wheat sales so I
                    recommend against it.” And he went predictably from counselor to counselor and
                    almost everyone told him things that could be done but recommended against doing
                    them. But of course, ultimately, we ended up doing almost all of those things.
                    However, nobody even at that staff meeting suggested boycotting the Moscow
                    Olympics. Nobody thought it would go that far.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I will always remember that staff meeting because it was so predictable how
                    everyone tried to protect his or her bureaucratic turf. However, it was all for
                    naught because the reaction from Jimmy Carter was very, very strong and we ended
                    up doing all of those things and more. When it became clear that this was
                    inevitable then of course certain people in the embassy became tougher than ever
                    on the Soviets. I remember at a later staff meeting, after the decision had been
                    made to boycott the Olympics, one person even suggested that the Embassy staff
                    be instructed not to watch the games on TV. This of course was rejected by
                    Watson as unenforceable and privately ridiculed throughout the Embassy. But it
                    illustrated the mood that developed. The interesting thing was that for the rest
                    of my time in Moscow, even though there were very bad bilateral relations in
                    public, the Soviets never retaliated against the Embassy by shutting doors or
                    cutting off our access. In fact, they always tried to show their desire for
                    getting back to business as usual in private contacts. It was their way of
                    showing that they hoped we would forgive and forget the Afghanistan matter and
                    get back to building d�tente, which of course they very much wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back just a bit. Before this you were dealing
                        with Soviet policies in Africa and Latin America, Cuba, other places. How
                        did we view Soviet policy? Was it seen as aggressive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, that's a very good question because my responsibility in the
                    external political section was in fact for Africa, the Middle East, Latin
                    America and parts of Eastern Europe. We had other people for Asia, Western
                    Europe, arms control and international economic issues but basically I did the
                    rest of the world. This was the developing world, or Third World as some called
                    it at the time, and our relations with the Soviets there were very competitive.
                    We were always watching what they did, and they watched us. There was one
                    curious incident that happened during my tour even before Afghanistan that I
                    think probably a lot of people don't even remember. It was the issue of a Soviet
                    brigade in Cuba. Do you remember the Soviet brigade in Cuba?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do but give us the background.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, in the fall of 1979 there were suddenly intelligence reports that
                    the Soviet Union had stationed a brigade of Soviet troops in Cuba— not missiles,
                    not nuclear weapons or anything like that but just that there was a Soviet
                    brigade in Cuba. It became public and there was a big outcry, particularly in
                    Congress. The Embassy was asked to do a demarche on this and to find out what
                    was going on. Again, it was Bob German, the Political Counselor, who delivered
                    the demarche, and again he took me along as the note taker. As I recall, we met
                    with Viktor Komplektov, who was a senior figure, the head of the Americas
                    Department in the Foreign Ministry. The demarche again hit a complete stonewall,
                    except this time the Soviets at least did not lie—they just would not answer.
                    Their position was that what the Soviets had in Cuba was their business and not
                    ours. They did not deny that there was a brigade, but neither did they admit it.
                    Then when Bob German kept pushing, Komplektov asked, “Are you saying that we do
                    not have the right to put Soviet troops into Cuba? Are you denying the Soviet
                    right to do this? “ Bob very effectively dodged the question but after the
                    meeting we had a long discussion in the Political Section which revealed that we
                    really were not sure of the answer. The problem was that we did not really know
                    what deals were struck during and after the Cuban missile crisis about what
                    could and couldn't be done in Cuba by the Soviets. In fact, even the desk in the
                    State Department could not give us a straight answer. Some people were saying
                    that there were agreements made by Kissinger years after the Cuban missile
                    crisis that were very closely held, and no one seemed to be sure what they
                    entailed. We never did get a clear answer from Washington, and I am not certain
                    that our Soviet interlocutor knew the answer. Komplektov may have been bluffing
                    with his rhetorical question and betting that we would be uncertain of our
                    answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been told that actually the Soviet brigade was the
                        sum of all the support troops that had already been there. Somebody had
                        added them up and said this represents a brigade but it really hadn't been
                        an introduction of a new force. It had been there all along but people were
                        surprised by the term brigade and this led to the crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Right. It all fizzled out in a few months. It was never resolved, and
                    then it got overtaken by the much larger issue of Afghanistan and people forgot
                    about the Soviet brigade. What was interesting again to me was dealing with
                    issues and agreements where you just didn't have all the facts. You didn't know
                    what really had been agreed because the agreements were oral and not properly
                    recorded, or at least not known even by the Embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you can't know if they hadn't been recorded or maybe
                        never agreed to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Kissinger was known for this kind of secret diplomacy, and subsequently
                    others whom I worked with were known for this. They purposely didn't record
                    things. A major problem with these oral agreements was that very different
                    interpretations could be taken by different sides because there would be no
                    written texts to refer to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Soviet presence in Africa at that
                        time? The Soviets put quite a bit of effort and money into Africa but it was
                        pretty hard to figure out what was in it for them. Or for us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was continual sparring between us and the Soviets but it seemed to
                    bring little benefit to the people of Africa. We supported regimes because they
                    were on our side and the Soviets supported their side but this perpetuated the
                    general bad governance on the African continent. But I do not recall any
                    specific crisis in Africa during my time. Everything was overshadowed by
                    Afghanistan.</p>

                        One reason why Tom Watson was sent out there was to boost the commercial
                        ties. Then Afghanistan happened and Brzezinski's position prevailed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Clearly, Brzezinski had a lot of input on this. The U.S. reaction to
                    Afghanistan was very tough. We did suspend the wheat sales, we basically stopped
                    almost all exchanges, and almost everything in the relationship was affected.
                    And we even did what very few people anticipated and that was the boycott of the
                    Olympics. That showed how really angry Washington was, and I think it even
                    surprised the Soviets. They anticipated a negative reaction to Afghanistan and
                    knew there was going to be fallout but I think they were really shocked by the
                    boycott of the Olympics. As you know, there was a big debate even in the U.S.
                    about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Olympics were a big event for Moscow, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>PERINA: They were a huge event for the Soviets. They had rebuilt the airport and
                    tried to refurbish the whole city. There were even rumors circulating in Moscow
                    that the Soviets were planning to seed rain clouds approaching the city so there
                    would be no rain in that 10-day period. I think this was an urban legend but
                    would not put it past the Soviets to try. They really wanted the games to be a
                    showcase, and we spoiled the whole thing for them. The games will always be
                    remembered as the Olympics that the U.S. boycotted. It wasn't then just the
                    U.S.; it was a fairly large number of countries but we were the organizers. We
                    tried to create an alternate Olympics because our athletes were so unhappy that
                    they couldn't compete. We created the Liberty Bell Classic in Philadelphia. A
                    friend of mine, Nelson Ledsky, was in charge of organizing that. It was not much
                    of a hit either, however. Carter's decision was much debated but I concluded in
                    later years that it had been the right thing to do. It got to the Soviets in a
                    way they could not hide from their people, and it put the Afghanistan invasion
                    into a chapter of the history book where the Soviets did not want it to be. Of
                    course, it was unfortunate for the athletes. And then, of course, the Soviets
                    had to retaliate so they didn't go to Los Angeles which was the next Olympics
                    four years later, even though by then our relationship was much improved. So you
                    had two Olympic games in a row that were damaged but I think it sent the message
                    to the Kremlin that international anger was genuine and deep, and it did so in a
                    way they could not hide from their own public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about working and living in Moscow during that
                        time: in the first place, getting out, seeing people both on the official
                        and on the personal level. How difficult was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, on the official level I never had problems with access to people in
                    the Foreign Ministry and elsewhere. Of course, these were generally junior
                    people like myself but even on senior levels, I did not detect a problem of
                    access. What never or very rarely worked was to have them over for dinner or
                    other social events in our homes. Only a limited number of individuals on the
                    Soviet side were authorized to have social contact with Westerners. Most of the
                    people at my level were on a very short leash in interacting with foreigners.
                    Even at higher levels, Soviet officials sometimes accepted but then did not show
                    up for events. After Afghanistan, the Embassy set limits and restrictions on
                    entertaining Soviet officials as part of our own refusal to have business as
                    usual. Basically, no purely social events were allowed. Only “working” lunches
                    and dinners could be held and had to be justified. So there was very little
                    social interaction, and it was limited to chatting with Soviet officials at
                    third country receptions and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>One interesting thing at the time was the on-going Sino-Soviet split. The Chinese
                    had an Embassy that was reputed to have the best food in Moscow for receptions
                    and so on. Everybody in the U.S. Embassy wanted to go for the great food. The
                    Chinese knew this and whenever they had an event they would invite virtually the
                    entire U.S. Embassy. This was just to irritate the Soviets because they
                    monitored this and they would see the entire U.S. Embassy going over to the
                    Chinese Embassy. It actually got so bad and provocative that Ambassador Toon
                    issued a directive that for any Chinese events he personally had to approve who
                    would attend so that there would not be too large a crowd of Americans. The
                    Chinese were very clever in things like this.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, I did do some travel in the Soviet Union but never found myself
                    harassed in any serious way, although it was during trips outside of Moscow that
                    I first detected surveillance. I am sure it happened in Moscow as well but I was
                    just not aware of it. In the provinces the KGB was not as sophisticated, and the
                    surveillance was really obvious and sometimes intense, particularly in the
                    Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. Once on a trip with Steve Coffey, who was
                    also in the Political Section, we went to Baku in the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic
                    and detected probably about a dozen people taking turns following us, especially
                    when we went to visit a mosque. The Soviets were very worried about their Muslim
                    population and our interest in it.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, certain people in the Embassy who did get a lot of
                    harassment from the Soviets. I was never among them. It was primarily the people
                    who dealt with human rights, who met with the refuseniks, dissidents, human
                    rights activists and so on. They were often harassed seriously. People at our
                    consulate in Leningrad had a particularly difficult time because the city had a
                    very hard-line mayor named Romanov at the time. Several of our officers there
                    who dealt with dissidents were beaten up by KGB thugs. The people in our Embassy
                    who dealt with dissidents were also harassed, though for the most part not
                    violently. Things could happen to their property, apartments and so on. In one
                    instance, the freezer of an officer who dealt with human rights issues was
                    unplugged while the family was away on vacation. This was actually quite serious
                    because most of our food was still imported from Helsinki, and a family could
                    incur hundreds of dollars of damage when something like that happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>But what I found most interesting, from a psychological viewpoint, were the
                    things the Soviets did just to remind Embassy officers of their vulnerability.
                    This would often consist of totally innocuous things happening in one's
                    apartment like, for example, something that was always on one side of the room
                    suddenly appearing on the other side. Things would be moved or changed in such a
                    way as to leave no doubt that someone had been in the apartment, but no damage
                    was done. This was very clever on the part of the KGB because they knew that
                    people would not lodge official complaints or protests about such things. The
                    Embassy would not protest to the Foreign Ministry that somebody had moved a lamp
                    from one table to another or eaten something and left a dirty plate on the
                    kitchen counter. Half the time people didn't even go to the RSO (Regional
                    Security Officer) because it seemed so petty. Or sometimes you actually weren't
                    even sure if maybe, in fact, you had put the thing on that table rather than on
                    another. But the bottom line was that a person was made to feel very insecure
                    and vulnerable because it was fairly obvious that someone had been in the
                    apartment. The implied message was: be careful, your behavior is being watched,
                    and next time something far more serious can happen.</p>
                <p>I found this a very interesting form of psychological harassment, and, while it
                    never bothered me or my family particularly, it did lead to paranoia among some
                    people. In some cases, I think, it led to people accusing the Soviets of doing
                    things whenever anything went wrong, even if perhaps the Soviets were not
                    actually at fault. You know, if the coffeemaker broke down people would assume,
                    “Well, the KGB did this.” Sometimes the Soviets may have done it but at times
                    they didn't and people just blamed them. But in a sense that also served the KGB
                    purpose because it underlined the insecurity and vulnerability, which is what
                    the KGB wanted. So people's paranoia would start working to the benefit of the
                    KGB. We did experience such harassment a number of times—once when one of my
                    wife's coats disappeared for several months and then suddenly reappeared hanging
                    in the closet. But how can someone protest that to the Foreign Ministry? That
                    was the beauty of the KGB scheme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem of radiation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was but we didn't know about it. We found out subsequently that
                    this was the period when the building was being microwaved. There was some real
                    anger about this toward the Department in later years because many people felt
                    that the Department had an obligation to tell employees about something that
                    could have negative health effects. The Department, of course, claimed there was
                    no evidence of negative health effects but many people are not convinced and
                    believe that the rates of cancer and miscarriages in particular have been higher
                    among employees who served in Moscow in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the technical people knew about the microwaves, and
                        the Ambassador must have been told. You can't disguise that sort of thing
                        from people who have the technical capabilities to monitor it but do not
                        tell their own.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>PERINA: No, we weren't told. The later government argument was that it was below
                    the level that can be damaging but as I understand nobody quite knows what that
                    level is. A similar thing at the time was the so-called “angel dust” that the
                    KGB put on steering wheels and door knobs of some employees to trace their
                    movements and so on. Again, as I understand, people weren't told about that but
                    it came out in later years. There, however, it is unclear if our government knew
                    about it, but they certainly knew about the microwaves and did not tell us. The
                    reason, as I have been told, is that we were doing the same thing to their
                    Embassy in Washington so neither side wanted to make an issue of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about leisure time for you and your family. Could you
                        get around, see things, do things, or was it difficult? How was life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Life could be difficult. For example, we lived in a diplomatic housing
                    compound run by the Soviets which was luxurious by Soviet standards but not at
                    all up to Western standards. We only had outdoor parking, and I remember that on
                    very cold days in winter—and it did get to 30 below— I had to remove the car
                    battery from our Plymouth Duster each evening and bring it up to the apartment
                    and then install it again in the morning. Otherwise the car would not start. The
                    incident I most remember is once dropping the battery and cracking it while
                    taking it inside. It was impossible to get a replacement in Moscow and ordering
                    it from Helsinki was very expensive. We ended buying one during a
                    previously-planned trip to Berlin and bringing it back on the train. We were
                    also hit once by an intoxicated Russian and had a badly damaged fender on our
                    Plymouth Duster. We managed to get it fixed by some skilled Russian workers for
                    a carton of cigarettes but it was still nerve-wracking. There were other things.
                    We had to bring a nanny from the United States, import fresh fruits and
                    vegetables from Helsinki, and so on. One also felt quite isolated. Phone calls
                    to the West had to be ordered a day in advance. There was no outside source of
                    news. I remember once how the Soviet TV announced that President Reagan had been
                    shot but then waited several hours to say whether he was alive or dead. There
                    was no CNN, no internet, no communication with the outside world. It is
                    difficult to imagine nowadays.</p>
                <p>But for the most part life was more normal than one would assume. By Soviet
                    standards, we lived in very privileged circumstances. We did take some trips as
                    a family. We went to Leningrad, Kiev and Odessa with the kids, and we had to go
                    through all the hoops and get all the permission but it was possible to do. We
                    went to the opera, to the Moscow circus, and our daughters even had ballet
                    lessons at a school run by the Bolshoi ballet. My father came to visit us—his
                    first trip to a Communist country since escaping from Czechoslovakia, and he
                    spoke of the visit with fascination for the rest of his life. All in all, it was
                    a remarkable place to be, with much to see and do. In subsequent years, we came
                    to see Moscow as perhaps the most interesting and memorable of our assignments.
                    It was a very cohesive Embassy community, and some of our most enduring friends
                    are from that period. It was an adventure.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the developments with Solidarnosc in
                        Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, I was going to say that this was the other big crisis during my tour
                    in Moscow, coming right after Afghanistan which had done such damage to our
                    relationship. Solidarnosc then appeared on the horizon, and the big question was
                    whether the Soviets would also invade Poland. By then Jack Matlock had come out
                    as the Charg� d'Affaires of the Embassy after Watson left, and we had many
                    sessions trying to analyze Soviet intentions and likely actions. I was always
                    skeptical that an invasion would come because the Soviets had their hands full
                    in Afghanistan. They knew that Poland would not be an easy place to invade, and
                    also I think our tough reaction to Afghanistan played a role by making them all
                    the more worried about how we would react to a Polish invasion. In this respect,
                    I think President Carter was proven correct in his tough reaction to
                    Afghanistan, and the Soviets were right that a Polish invasion would have had
                    even more serious consequences. But also I think the Soviets chose not to invade
                    because of the difficulties Solidarnosc itself was having. The actions of
                    Solidarnosc at that time did not appear as a success for Poland, or something
                    that other Warsaw Pact countries would want to emulate. The danger of infection,
                    which the Kremlin feared greatly, was not there. The Polish economy was
                    nose-diving from all of the strikes and unrest. Poland was going more and more
                    into debt and economic chaos. As long as this appeared to be the trend, the
                    Soviets were basically hoping that the example of Poland was negative rather
                    than positive to the rest of the bloc, and that Solidarnosc would collapse as a
                    result of its own actions. This was very different from Prague in 1968, which
                    the Kremlin clearly feared would be an example that others tried to emulate. But
                    we spent a lot of time watching the situation in Poland, knowing that the
                    Soviets did not always think rationally and that hot rather than cool heads
                    could prevail.</p>

                <p>PERINA: We were, and they were totally out of the loop, frankly. Nobody was
                    talking to them. They were very isolated. We as an Embassy tended to know far
                    more than they did about Soviet attitudes. It was interesting because the
                    Soviets always tried to maintain a good relationship with us. They knew
                    relations were already damaged because of Afghanistan but their approach was to
                    try to preserve as much of the relationship as possible. The poor Poles,
                    however, were clearly ostracized despite being a Warsaw Pact ally.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>PERINA: We did. We had numerous demarches about Solidarnosc. I was not
                    specifically involved in those because there were others who were specifically
                    following Poland but we certainly did raise Polish events with them. We tried to
                    keep up a dialogue, and the Soviets would engage to some degree on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the institutes like the USA and Canada

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That was Georgiy Arbatov's institute. It put itself forward as an
                    independent think tank, and it was the closest thing to a think tank in the
                    Soviet Union so that is the reason why many Westerners flocked to it. It was, of
                    course, hardly independent, and Arbatov was a very clever apologist for the
                    Kremlin who knew how to give the appearance of independence to Western
                    audiences. He saw himself as very skilled in dealing with Westerners and would
                    occasionally be critical of Soviet actions to try to maintain credibility but in
                    the end almost invariably supported Soviet actions. He was primarily useful as
                    another voice of the government, but sometimes a more sophisticated voice than
                    what we heard in the Foreign Ministry or read in the press. So he did serve a
                    role, though a very disingenuous one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Berlin situation in 1981 because this was
                        always a city of tension between East and West?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>PERINA: The situation calmed considerably after the Quadripartite Agreement of
                    1971, which to a large degree stabilized the way the four allies interacted.
                    There were still big differences in our interpretations of the Agreement and the
                    status of Berlin, however. The whole theology of Berlin was extremely
                    complicated. For example, we considered East Berlin still the Soviet zone of
                    occupied Berlin. However, the Soviets had accepted it as part of the GDR (German
                    Democratic Republic) and the capital of East Germany. So we had completely
                    different views on the status of East Berlin, which had real consequences for
                    actions in many areas. For example, when we traveled to East Berlin, we always
                    insisted on being checked by Soviet officials, not by East German officials,
                    because we did not recognize East German sovereignty in East Berlin. If we had
                    any problems in East Berlin, we complained to the Soviets and not to the East
                    Germans. The GDR officials, on the other hand, wanted to make the point that
                    this was now their capital, the capital of the GDR. So a complicated procedure
                    was developed as a type of modus vivendi for dealing with all these differing
                    viewpoints. Thus, when we crossed from West to East Berlin via Checkpoint
                    Charlie, we would have these cards that we would show through the car window to
                    GDR guards, but we would always keep the windows closed and not speak with the
                    guards. If there were any problems, we complained to the Soviets. The East
                    Germans came to accept this but were always pushing the envelope in one way or
                    another. These kinds of practical arrangements were developed to cope in
                    practical ways with all the contradictions of the situation. Berlin was full of
                    this kind of theology.</p>
                <p>There were similarly complex procedures related to road corridors to West Germany
                    and the air corridors for air traffic. But by and large, the major crises of
                    Berlin had passed by 1981. It was still probably the city with more espionage
                    going on per square mile than in any other city in Europe simply because it was
                    so easy for each of the four occupying powers—the U.S., the Soviet Union, the UK
                    and France—as well as the East and West Germans to spy on one another. Each of
                    the occupying powers had virtual sovereignty in their sector so they could do
                    anything: control the police, control the phone network, build radio towers,
                    etc. They were basically the law. So there was a lot of eavesdropping, everybody
                    listening to everybody else and so on. But overall, the situation was stable
                    compared to years past.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, for four years. I had two different jobs in that period. The first
                    was called the Protocol Officer job but it was actually the job of being the
                    liaison with the Soviets on Berlin matters. This made sense because I had just
                    come from Moscow, knew Russian and so on. I had a counterpart in the Soviet
                    Embassy in East Berlin who dealt with me on Berlin matters. But I did not deal
                    with the East Germans in any way because we had by that time opened a U.S.
                    Embassy in East Berlin. Since we saw East Berlin as the Soviet sector of
                    occupied Berlin and not as the capital of the GDR, the phrase we used was to say
                    that our Embassy was “to the GDR but not in the GDR.” Obviously, there was a lot
                    of convoluted theology here but it brought stability to the city and to the
                    relationship between the two Germanys. And it was not just the U.S. that
                    compromised but the Soviets and East Germans had to as well. A lot of their
                    practical actions were also inconsistent with the positions of principle they
                    espoused.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of issues did you talk about with the
                        Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We would talk about all issues that came up related to Berlin. The
                    Soviets really had an inconsistency to deal with because they wanted to have
                    their cake and eat it also. They wanted to support the position of their ally
                    the GDR but also still be regarded as one of four occupying powers of Berlin
                    that had special privileges in West Berlin, such as access, a role in
                    quadripartite discussions and so on. So they supported the GDR publicly but not
                    always privately. A lot of things I talked about with my Soviet counterpart
                    consisted of problems caused by the GDR—impeding our access to East Berlin via
                    Checkpoint Charlie, causing problems through new restrictions on the air or road
                    corridors to West Berlin and so on. The Soviets would usually say that it was
                    none of their business and that we had to talk to the GDR, but then they would
                    go ahead and help resolve the problem by bringing the East Germans into line. It
                    was a continual tug of war. There was also another category of problems I dealt
                    with, and those were problems caused by the Soviets in West Berlin. We
                    recognized privileged Soviet access to West Berlin because this stemmed from our
                    interpretation of Berlin's status and we wanted the same privileges in East
                    Berlin but of course we kept a close watch on them when they came. The problems
                    that arose varied from drunken Soviet soldiers getting into bar fights to clear
                    cases of attempted espionage by Soviet personnel from East Berlin. I remember
                    one instance where I had to call my counterpart in the middle of the night, and
                    we expelled two Soviet military officers for attempted espionage. They were
                    caught red-handed trying to buy information from U.S. military personnel. In
                    these cases, we would turn them over to Soviet authorities with a protest, and
                    the Soviets would give a pro forma protest in return. We would not arrest them
                    because we did recognize a type of diplomatic immunity for all occupying powers
                    in all of Berlin, so we just kicked them out of the Western sectors. Toward the
                    end of my time, we had another kind of incident—Polish hijackings of aircraft to
                    West Berlin. They became a favorite way for Poles to escape from Poland, and we
                    must have had six or seven toward the end of my Berlin tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a result of martial law in Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, the country was moving toward martial law, and a lot of Poles were
                    trying to get out because they saw a big crackdown coming. One of the favorite
                    ways to escape was to hijack a plane and fly to West Berlin where they would
                    land at Tempelhof airport and become our responsibility because it was in the
                    U.S. sector. The distance from Poland to West Berlin was very short, and for
                    Poles it was the closest thing to reaching American custody and protection. We
                    had a number of these, mostly commercial airliners from LOT but also private
                    planes, crop dusters and so on. We soon had a set routine of dealing with them.
                    We would hold the crew and passengers overnight and question them, giving
                    everyone the option of staying in the West or returning to Poland. We made a
                    point of always punishing the hijacker or hijackers because we didn't want to
                    condone hijacking, but they were handed over to German courts and often received
                    fairly light sentences, though these did usually include imprisonment. There was
                    an internal debate we had after the first hijacking on whether the hijackers
                    should be tried by us, by the Americans, in courts that we establish. This was
                    consistent with our position on the rights of the occupying powers but in
                    practice promised to be extremely complicated. We would have had to set up a
                    court, fly in judges, and so on. In the end, we decided it was easier to hand
                    the hijackers over to the Germans for punishment. But the punishment was light
                    enough that hijackers kept coming, and the Polish authorities were very
                    frustrated by their inability to stop this. They started putting undercover air
                    marshals on LOT flights, sometimes several on a flight, and usually the air
                    marshals themselves were very tempted to stay in the West, if only because they
                    were in big trouble for allowing the hijacking to happen.</p>
                <p>There were many emotional experiences at these all-night sessions with people who
                    suddenly found themselves in the West and faced the unexpected decision of
                    whether to stay or go back to Poland. These were ordinary Poles who happened to
                    be on the airplane but once they were in our sector, they knew that if they
                    chose to stay we would allow them to do so. Sometimes you could see families
                    debating through the night what to do because it was clearly a momentous life
                    decision. Quite a few chose to stay, though I do not have the statistics. This
                    was primarily on the commercial flights that came in. We also had some
                    hijackings by people who would take crop dusters or similar small aircraft and
                    just fly out. One fellow got an old plane somewhere, painted red stars on it so
                    that it wouldn't be shot down, and used a roadmap to find Berlin, flying just
                    several hundred feet above the road. The ingenuity was amazing.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>One interesting thing in my dealings with the Soviets that I forgot to mention
                    consisted of visits to their Embassy in East Berlin. The Embassy was and remains
                    still this huge building on the famous avenue Unter den Linden. Once my Soviet
                    counterpart gave me a tour of the building, starting with an enormous marble
                    staircase in the lobby. He asked me: “Do you know where that marble comes from?”
                    I said, “No.” He said, “Well, that is marble that Hitler was taking to Moscow to
                    build a monument celebrating his victory over the Soviet Union. We brought it
                    back here and made it into the staircase of the Soviet Embassy in Berlin.” I
                    don't know if that's an apocryphal story or not. It sounds apocryphal, but it's
                    also very Soviet. There was also a chair in a reception room on the second floor
                    where some visitors were taken. It was an old leather chair, and he told me to
                    sit in it and asked, “Do you know what chair that is?” And I said, “No.” He
                    said, “Well, that was Hitler's favorite chair from the Reichskanzlei.” I mean, a
                    lot of people would not be proud to have Hitler's chair or to put you into
                    Hitler's chair but clearly the Soviets took pride in this, an ever present
                    reminder of how they had beaten the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sense from the diplomats you dealt with
                        that things were beginning to loosen up in the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not really, and the developments in Poland suggested the opposite. But
                    one thing that I began to perceive and that really became apparent in my next
                    assignment at NATO was how very scared the Soviets were becoming of American
                    technological know-how, and particularly of SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative).
                    This was about the time that SDI was coming into the news as part of Reagan's
                    plan to make nuclear weapons obsolete. It was, of course, very controversial,
                    with much debate on whether it was really possible to build a shield against
                    nuclear attack that would take away the threat of nuclear war. But I can tell
                    you that the Soviets I dealt with took it very seriously and seemed very
                    concerned about getting into a high-tech competition with the United States. The
                    glory of the Sputnik was long past, the computer age was beginning, and the
                    Soviets sensed that they were very far behind. They also realized that their
                    strength as a world power came from possession of nuclear weapons, and not from
                    their GDP or anything else. Without the clout of nuclear weapons, they would be
                    in big trouble, and they realized this. Already in Berlin my Soviet counterpart
                    would turn social conversations to SDI and try to argue why the U.S. should
                    abandon the effort. Since neither of us had any responsibility for this issue,
                    it was clear to me that his comments came from generic talking points that all
                    Soviet diplomats had been instructed to use whenever possible.</p>
                <p>This was, of course, within the context of the big debate in Germany about NATO
                    deployment of intermediate range nuclear weapons (INF) to counter the SS-20
                    missiles deployed by the Soviets. It was a huge controversy during my time in
                    Germany because there was much European opposition. When President Reagan
                    visited Berlin while I was there, we had huge demonstrations against him by
                    Germans opposed to INF deployment. So these nuclear issues were very much on the
                    table during this period, and while East-West relations were stable in Berlin,
                    there was a lot of tension in the broader U.S.-Soviet relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with American soldiers getting loose
                        in the Eastern zone and getting into trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well there were incidents like this, but fewer than one would imagine
                    because of fairly strict regulations on U.S. soldiers going to East Berlin. I
                    don't recall any specific protests from the Soviets of this nature. By and
                    large, our military was quite disciplined and responsible, and there were far
                    more opportunities to get into trouble in West Berlin without the need to cross
                    into the East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the American Ambassador at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was Arthur Burns, our Ambassador in Bonn. He had two hats. He was our
                    Ambassador to the FRG in Bonn, but he was also the head of the U.S. Mission to
                    West Berlin. So he also had two Soviet counterparts—the Soviet Ambassador in
                    Bonn and the Soviet Ambassador in East Berlin on Berlin issues. There was a
                    tradition that every six months there was a lunch on Berlin issues between the
                    U.S. Ambassador and the Soviet Ambassador. Because I was the working-level
                    liaison to the Soviets on these issues, and because I knew Russian, I was asked
                    shortly after my arrival to serve as the U.S. interpreter at one such lunch, and
                    I ended up doing it for my entire time in Berlin. In fact, once I was even asked
                    to fly to Bonn and interpret at a lunch that Ambassador Burns had with his
                    Russian counterpart in Bonn. But usually I interpreted at the Berlin lunches,
                    which alternated between East and West Berlin. The way it worked was that both
                    Ambassadors brought an interpreter, and the Russian fellow interpreted English
                    into Russian and I did Russian into English. This was easiest for both of us
                    because neither I nor the Russian, I think, were professional interpreters. But
                    it worked well and allowed me to participate at all the lunches.</p>
                <p>The first Soviet Ambassador for whom I interpreted was Piotr Abrassimov, who was
                    a Berlin institution. He was a very senior Soviet Ambassador, an expert on
                    Berlin who had negotiated the 1971 Quadripartite Agreement. After he departed,
                    he was replaced in East Berlin by Vyacheslav Kochemasov, a less influential
                    Ambassador for whom I also interpreted at these lunches. The lunches were fun to
                    do, although I learned that interpreters rarely get a chance to eat and should
                    not even try. The amazing thing about the lunches, however, was how little
                    substance was actually discussed between the two Ambassadors. To be sure, there
                    were always a few points that we wanted Arthur Burns to raise, and the Soviets
                    would have their counterpoints if we raised our points, but by and large the
                    lunches were social events. This was perhaps a reflection of how stable the
                    situation around Berlin had become.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any feel about East Germany from the
                        place where you sat, any sense that the East German government was having a
                        hard time trying to control the internal situation in the GDR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We didn't really sense that for the simple reason that we tried to avoid
                    dealing with the East Germans. That was the job of our Embassy in East Berlin,
                    and we tried to stick to dealing with the Soviets and with the West Germans. We
                    dealt with the West Germans because we recognized that Berlin was a German city
                    and the occupation would someday end, but technically we had sovereignty in West
                    Berlin and only delegated the governing of the city to the Germans. My second
                    job in Berlin, during the last two years of my tour, was in fact what was called
                    the “Senate Liaison Officer.” This was the liaison to the West Berlin
                    government. I had an office and permanent staff in the West Berlin city hall, as
                    did my French and British counterparts. The German city government had to
                    regularly inform us of developments, and we—that is the Allies—had to concur
                    with legislation passed by the Berlin senate. Of course, for the most part we
                    did, and a lot of this had become routinized but it was still a unique situation
                    for a diplomat.</p>
                <p>Another example of this was that as Protocol Officer I and my French and British
                    counterparts always went to the airport to greet the West German President
                    whenever he came to Berlin and to say good-bye when he was leaving. This was to
                    make the point that he was visiting somewhere that was not a part of West
                    Germany, and that we the Allies were in fact the hosts in Berlin. The
                    Presidents, who in my time were Richard von Weizsacker and Karl Carstens, were
                    always very polite and cordial as we shook hands but they must have hated this
                    ritualistic reminder that Berlin was not a part of their country. Actually, the
                    Protocol Officers hated it as well as a real nuisance, but it was a Berlin
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>But the Bonn government of course played a very large role in Berlin and was the
                    de facto government. One interesting aspect of this was the great rivalry in
                    Berlin between the two Germanys—East and West. The West Germans put a huge
                    amount of money into Berlin to keep the city prosperous, deter people from
                    leaving and build this Western showcase in the middle of the GDR. Much of the
                    city and its cultural life were subsidized by Bonn. This included everything
                    from the universities to the opera, theater and museums. Even in the private
                    sector, this magnificent department store, the Kaufhaus des Westens or KaDeWe as
                    it was called, with its food section that included thousands of different
                    cheeses and sausages, was a political statement designed to show the difference
                    between East and West. The West German government also paid for all the
                    operating expenses of the three Western powers in Berlin, including things like
                    housing and furniture. Of course, in return West Germans were getting the
                    defense of West Berlin so it was still a pretty good deal for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about the Soviets. What about the French and the
                        British? They had their own sectors and did you get involved with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>PERINA: We coordinated very closely with the French and the British. As a matter
                    of fact, we even had our own telegraphic network in Berlin that connected the
                    British, the French and the U.S. Missions in West Berlin so we could very
                    quickly send confidential messages to one another. You have to remember that
                    this was before the internet. It was another unique aspect of Berlin that I had
                    not seen elsewhere. This was a classified network, just like the State
                    Department's classified telegraphic system. The rule on the system was that
                    messages could be sent in either English or French. Of course, the French always
                    sent us messages in French whereas we and the British always sent messages in
                    English. Once on April 1 the U.S. Minister, Nelson Ledsky, a man with a good
                    sense of humor, sent out a message I drafted to the French and the British
                    saying that we had received new instructions from Washington and were no longer
                    allowed to receive messages in French because of the delay in translating them
                    during possible crises. The French fell for it and got very upset before
                    realizing it was April 1. But on your question, the coordination was very good
                    among the three Western allies, and we had very few disagreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with our Embassy in East Berlin? Did
                        you have much contact with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not particularly but we coordinated as colleagues. The U.S. Ambassador in
                    East Berlin during my time was Roz Ridgway who later became Assistant Secretary
                    for European Affairs. As happens bureaucratically, there was an element of
                    rivalry between the Mission in West Berlin and the Embassy in East Berlin,
                    especially in reporting to Washington. If it was a Berlin issue, we were
                    supposed to report it. If it was an East German issue, the Embassy was supposed
                    to report it. Clearly, there was sometimes overlap on specific issues and
                    disagreement over who had action. But it was rarely serious and perhaps
                    contributed to a healthy competition that improved overall reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under any menace or threat during your time
                        in Berlin as a result of East-West relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not really. If you had asked me, I and I think most others would have
                    answered that the Berlin situation was very stable and likely to continue
                    unchanged for a long time into the future. We didn't feel any menace in the Cold
                    War context. Nobody seriously thought that there was going to be a World War III
                    or an invasion of Berlin by the Warsaw Pact. Where we felt a certain degree of
                    menace was from radical West German groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Baader-Meinhof gang?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>PERINA: Exactly. The Baader-Meinhof gang and its off-shoots and imitators. There
                    had long been attacks against West German political figures and businessman, and
                    a number had taken place in Berlin. Although it had seemed that Americans were
                    not targeted, the 1980's brought a significant rise in anti-Americanism as a
                    result of the INF deployment debate. Berlin also had a reputation as a haven for
                    West German radicals because students and young people living there were exempt
                    from the draft. We had growing concerns about terrorist attacks against U.S.
                    interests from such groups, although nothing serious happened during my
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Berlin in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you knew that there would only be four more years
                        of the Berlin Wall and then the entire Cold War would come to a screeching
                        end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, on the contrary, I thought that what I had learned about the
                    theology of Berlin would guarantee me employment for the rest of my career in
                    the State Department. There were not many people who knew the ins and outs of
                    Berlinery, the rules of the corridors and so on. I thought this was valuable
                    knowledge that would always serve me well and make me a permanent expert on
                    Berlin. Of course, within five years it was totally worthless except to the
                    historians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So from 1985 until 1987 you were at the NATO Mission in
                        Brussels. What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was a political officer and the Deputy U.S. Representative to the
                    Political Committee of NATO. I had a number of other portfolios, among which
                    were the nuclear and space talks in Geneva. President Reagan started this
                    negotiation. The talks were basically three simultaneous negotiations on START,
                    INF and SDI, headed by Max Kampelman on our side. Kampelman was the overall
                    delegation head and did the SDI talks, Mike Glitman headed the INF discussions,
                    and Senator John Tower headed the START team. It was intended as a comprehensive
                    arms control discussion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Because the talks
                    were bilateral but related directly to NATO policies, the three negotiators
                    regularly came up to Brussels from Geneva to brief the North Atlantic Council.
                    At the beginning, they came every month or two, though the pace slackened as the
                    talks started bogging down. Nonetheless, I was always the control officer for
                    these visits, as well as for a number of visits by President Reagan, who came to
                    NATO several times for summit-level meetings of the Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>As I said earlier, this is where I saw further evidence of what an important
                    issue SDI was to the Soviet Union. Everything that Max Kampelman and the
                    negotiators reported to NATO bore this out. The Soviets were very afraid of SDI
                    and wanted desperately to find ways of stopping or restricting it. But it was
                    something that Reagan—rightly or wrongly—believed in very strongly and would not
                    negotiate away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that at one point Reagan made a proposal to share
                        the technology with the Soviets so that we could each stop the other's
                        missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Right. But the Soviets were convinced it was a trick. They could not
                    believe that we would really share such technology with them, since they would
                    never share it with us if tables were turned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting the sense that the advent of the computer
                        age and high tech was playing into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: This is exactly what I was going to say. You have to put this in the
                    context of the revolution that was taking place in the United States and in the
                    West, with average people starting to acquire personal computers, and kids
                    growing up at home and in school with computer skills. The Soviets saw all this,
                    and they were terrified. Their own kids were still working with an abacus in
                    most of their schools. They saw themselves falling behind technologically in a
                    way that would be qualitative and devastating. They never expressed it that way
                    but one could sense it in talks with them. I was not an expert on SDI. I didn't
                    know if it would or would not work. But I saw it as a useful ploy to motivate
                    the Soviets to change to a freer, more open system that could keep pace with
                    Western technological development. Their closed, authoritarian system just could
                    not do that. In conversations, they always tried to pick up on Western
                    skepticism and say “Well, SDI won't work and even your own experts say it won't
                    work.” But I would answer something like “Well, you know, if you can build a
                    missile that can fly 5000 miles and hit a square block, don't you think it would
                    be easier to find some way to throw that missile off course?” They were very
                    scared that this was indeed true and we would beat them to doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the NATO apparatus? You had
                        been working with two other allies in Berlin but this was now the entire
                        Alliance trying to work in tandem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>PERINA: My overwhelming impression from NATO was that this was basically a U.S.
                    run organization. One could really sense that. Most of the Allies were quite
                    deferential to the United States, the French always being a certain exception.
                    In fact, most of the delegates at NATO tended to be even more pro-American than
                    their governments, or at least they tried to give us that impression. In my
                    time, we never had a really heated discussion at NATO, even though I think many
                    Allies were skeptical of some of our policies such as INF deployment and SDI.
                    Whenever Kampelman and his colleagues came up, the questions were invariably
                    softball in nature. NATO was a club and largely our club. It was a very friendly
                    environment for the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at the time of how much chance
                        the nuclear and space talks had of succeeding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The talks never got very far. The Soviets could not stop either SDI or
                    INF deployment. The major obstacle to INF was Western European resistance, not
                    Moscow. Eventually arms control talks were all overtaken by events when the
                    Warsaw Pact and later the Soviet Union came apart. It was a whole new
                    ballgame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point, how did you view Reagan and his
                        presidency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: When I was at NATO I didn't know that my next assignment would be the
                    National Security Council where I would work with him much more closely. At
                    NATO, I had mixed views. He certainly came into office with very hardline,
                    conservative views that gave me concern. The Iran Contra scandal, which happened
                    while I was at NATO, was likewise cause for worry about his presidency. But I
                    also felt that some of his ideas, like SDI, were quite astute tactically,
                    whether or not they could actually be implemented. So it was a mixed picture,
                    and I had mixed views. But I did not feel I really knew him well until I worked
                    on the National Security Council staff, to which I was recruited from NATO in
                    1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were on the NSC staff from 1987 to 1989. What were
                        your responsibilities there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I came in partly as a result of Iran Contra. There was a big purge at the
                    NSC, and many people left. It was not just Ollie North, Fawn Hall and those
                    linked to Iran Contra but others as well. There was a new National Security
                    Advisor, Frank Carlucci, and a sense that he should have a new team. He brought
                    in Colin Powell as his deputy, and Powell interviewed me for the job. Later,
                    Powell was replaced by John Negroponte, whom I also got to know well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contacts on the NSC staff or how were you
                        chosen to work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, as is often the case in this business, it did come from contacts.
                    The new Senior NSC Director for Soviet and European affairs was a think tank
                    Soviet expert named Fritz Ermarth. He chose as his deputy an FSO named Nelson
                    Ledsky, who had been the Minister and my boss in Berlin for four years. Nelson
                    called me at NATO and asked me to come and work on the staff on Soviet and East
                    European issues. I flew back to Washington to interview with Colin Powell and
                    got the job, which required me to curtail at NATO after only two years.</p>
                <p>Within a few months I was working at the NSC, and one of the first issues that
                    came up was the visit of President Reagan to Berlin. This was the visit when he
                    made the “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate; Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall”
                    speech. We were working on the speech during my first week in the NSC and got
                    into a terrible fight with the State Department. The Department was very much
                    opposed to this passage in the speech, and Tom Simons as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary in the European Bureau spearheaded the effort to have it deleted. The
                    State Department's objection was not to the phrases “Open this gate, tear down
                    this wall.” Rather, the Department objected to saying “Mr. Gorbachev.” They did
                    not want to personalize the words to Gorbachev in fear that this would be a
                    direct challenge and target him in front of all the Kremlin hardliners.
                    Generally, we in the NSC thought the State Department was being unduly cautious,
                    as is often its reputation. Ultimately, the issue went to President Reagan, and
                    he decided to keep “Mr. Gorbachev.” The world did not come to an end, and, as
                    you know, the speech is now one of Reagan's most famous ones. But I quickly
                    learned how working on the NSC could put me at odds with colleagues in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Iran Contra affair, was there a feeling in the
                        NSC that things had to be done differently than before? Was there a sense
                        that we really got into a mess and cannot let this happen again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was a sense of a new beginning because of the many personnel
                    changes and the new leadership of Frank Carlucci and Colin Powell. It was really
                    a very different institution from the one before, and it was assumed that the
                    Poindexter/Ollie North era was past. I think we were fortunate in that a very
                    good team came in. Carlucci was a good administrator, and Colin Powell was, I
                    think, an outstanding leader. It confirmed my view that the military does much
                    better than the State Department in teaching leadership and management skills.
                    In part, this is because most FSO's have very little opportunity to manage and
                    supervise others until at least the mid-career level, whereas in the military
                    one is both subordinate and supervisor almost from the beginning. Even in the
                    military, of course, Powell was far above the norm and an outstanding leader. He
                    knew how to keep up morale and supervise without micromanaging. So I think even
                    the people who were holdovers from the Poindexter era recognized that this was a
                    new NSC that would be run differently. In the job I took I replaced Paula
                    Dobriansky, a political appointee who went on to senior jobs in the State
                    Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the Soviet portfolio on the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Basically, yes. The Senior Director of the office when I arrived was also
                    a Soviet expert, Fritz Ermarth, but I did the working-level issues of which
                    there were many concerning the Soviet Union. Ermarth left after about a year and
                    was replaced by his deputy, Nelson Ledsky, who was not a trained Soviet expert.
                    So I took on more of the portfolio in the office and became the primary Soviet
                    person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take it when you arrived. You had been away from the
                        Soviet Union since 1981. You had been on the periphery of Soviet issues but
                        now you were directly involved again. How did you see the Soviet Union when
                        you arrived at the NSC in 1987, as opposed to when you left Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: When I arrived at the NSC there was a big ongoing debate within the
                    government on trying to interpret Gorbachev, trying to understand if he was a
                    genuine reformer or just playing a very sophisticated game. The opinion was
                    divided. Some people thought he was a genuine reformer, while others thought he
                    was playing us and we had to be very wary of the guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of intelligence, we had spent millions of dollars
                        getting intelligence about the Soviet Union and yet we did not seem to be
                        able to predict the complete collapse of the system. Was there anybody you
                        knew who was saying that the Soviet Union would collapse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. Nobody that I knew at this time suspected that the Soviet Union was
                    going to collapse. It seemed so out of the realm of the possible that it was not
                    even part of any discussion. There was one person whom I knew at this time who
                    told me that the Soviet Union might come apart, and his name was Paul Goble. He
                    was an expert on Soviet nationalities and ethnic groups. He was sort of an
                    advisor and think tank person who was in and out of government but he was
                    probably the greatest expert in the U.S. on nationality groups within the Soviet
                    Union. He told me that there was a rise of nationalism among all Soviet ethnic
                    groups and a chance that this could lead to the Soviet Union splitting apart in
                    the not-too-distant future. Very frankly, nobody believed it, and Paul got
                    little attention from the government. We were all watching the top, the Kremlin,
                    and could not imagine that this empire would crack from below.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>In retrospect, of course, the Soviet Union came apart from both the top and the
                    bottom, but we did not pay enough attention to the internal situation, and
                    particularly to the nationality issues. We focused on Kremlinology, security
                    issues, the economy and so on, but we clearly missed something vital that was
                    happening within the country and that made it so vulnerable to the changes
                    Gorbachev initiated. The Soviet dissidents were more aware of this, but no one
                    took them seriously. After all, Adam Amalrik published his book Will the Soviet
                    Union Survive until 1984? already in 1970, but we did not see a collapse coming
                    even in the late 1980's. Of course, in fairness, this is how history usually
                    works. If we had seen the collapse coming, the Politburo would have seen it also
                    and would have tried to so something about it. The collapse was not inevitable
                    at this particular time in history. To some degree, all momentous events are
                    unpredictable because otherwise there are always those who would try to stop or
                    alter them before they become certain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you find yourself on the Gorbachev debate? Did
                        you see him as a reformist, a con man or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: My views developed over time. At first, I though he was something in
                    between a reformer and a con man. The two are not mutually exclusive. But I did
                    not anticipate that he would do the kinds of things that he did do. I did not
                    think he would set in train events that would make the Soviet Union come apart.
                    Of course, he did not expect to do those things also. But when the time came, he
                    allowed them to happen and made the right decisions. That is what counts. In
                    retrospect, I think he's an enormously important historical figure, among the
                    most important of our time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the views of Ronald Reagan on the subject? They
                        seem to have evolved as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, they did. Jumping ahead a little, toward the end of my tour in the
                    NSC, I accompanied Reagan to Moscow, to the 1988 Moscow summit which was
                    Reagan's only visit to Moscow as president. I in fact was one of the two note
                    takers in the one-on-one sessions between Reagan and Gorbachev in Moscow. They
                    call them one-on-one sessions but in reality they are four on four sessions
                    because every president has an interpreter and two note takers so there are
                    three people on each side plus the president. I was one of the note takers
                    together with Tom Simons who was Deputy Assistant Secretary in the European
                    Bureau. I raise these meetings because they were the direct opportunity I had to
                    see Reagan and Gorbachev interact. Even at the Moscow summit, which was late in
                    Reagan's presidency, there was a lot of tension between the two men. Gorbachev
                    did play games and he did try to trick Reagan in certain ways. One was the old
                    Soviet trick of trying to get agreement on broad and vague declarations that
                    sounded very innocent and innocuous, all motherhood and apple pie, and when you
                    read them you would say, how could anyone oppose something like this? But then
                    you could see that if you signed them the Soviets would find interpretations for
                    the various declaratory statements and come back and try to circumscribe and
                    limit specific policy options on the grounds that they went counter to the broad
                    principles. Basically, this related to the different negotiating styles of the
                    Soviets and the US. The Soviets had a deductive style of negotiation. They would
                    want to agree on a broad principle and then go down and see how it applied to
                    concrete action. The U.S. generally had an inductive style of negotiation. We
                    would look at specific problems and practical things and say what broad
                    agreement does this require or what principle do we need to regulate this? You
                    could see this difference in negotiating patterns in Moscow because Gorbachev in
                    the one-on-one sessions did try to get Reagan to agree to such broad declaratory
                    language. In the first session, he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket and
                    tried to get Reagan's concurrence on the spot. The paper was essentially a set
                    of broad declarations that appeared innocent. But it was all based on this
                    tactic that you try to get agreement on principles, and then you use those
                    principles to limit your opponent, limit the scope of action of what your
                    opponent can do.</p>
                <p>Gorbachev tried this in Moscow, and he clearly felt intellectually superior to
                    Reagan. He would sometimes look at us, the note takers, after making a point
                    with this expression that seemed to say: Wasn't that a good point? See how smart
                    I am! But by the time of the Moscow summit Reagan had learned that Gorbachev
                    tried to do these kinds of things, and he would not agree to any of these
                    declarations without his advisors present. He would politely resist, even though
                    it was difficult for him. Reagan was actually a real gentleman who felt very
                    uneasy in becoming adversarial or saying no to someone. He was very polite. But
                    by the time of the Moscow summit, when his relationship with Gorbachev was much
                    better than in the early years, he still did not trust the man and he knew his
                    own limits—that he should not agree to any document without the advice of his
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense concern on the part of the staff that Reagan
                        would agree to things he should not? Did they give him warnings before he
                        went into meetings and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>PERINA: There was an incident earlier in Reagan's presidency when he was tricked
                    like this by Gorbachev, and by the time of the Moscow summit he had learned to
                    be wary of these tactics. But of course there was always some concern among all
                    of us that he might be tricked again in these one-on-one sessions. Reagan had
                    good instincts but he clearly did not have the grasp of substance that Gorbachev
                    had. He was also vulnerable because he was basically a nice guy who hated to say
                    no. One of his strengths, however, was that he knew his limitations. For the
                    most part, he listened to and followed his advisors. It was probably why he was
                    misled in the Iran-Contra affair, but it also prevented him from getting into
                    trouble on many occasions. Reagan was a great person to work for because he did
                    use the talking points prepared for him. He used these 3 x 5 cards but those
                    were his lines and he read his lines. I mean, he was an actor. He was trained to
                    deliver his lines. It was a fascinating experience because I used to write these
                    lines and, whereas with many people you never knew if they were going to be used
                    and probably nine times out of ten they were not used, with President Reagan
                    there was a very good chance that what you put on that 3 x 5 card is exactly
                    what he would say. I was in a lot of the Oval Office meetings, and sometimes you
                    could see that if there was something critical or negative in Reagan's talking
                    points, he really hated to say it, but in the end he usually did. He would say
                    it because it was on his card and because he knew he was expected to say it. In
                    that respect he was a pleasure to work for, especially to a mid-level officer
                    who was writing the President's lines.</p>
                <p>This was, of course, very different from my experience working with most other
                    senior people. For example, I worked for the first Bush, for George Bush and he
                    was quite the opposite. You could write a briefing book for him and you would
                    never know if he would look at it or not because he felt he knew the issues, and
                    he very rarely used the talking points that were given to him. Reagan learned
                    his lines because he knew his limitations on substance and details. But Reagan,
                    at least in my view, had pretty good instincts on larger issues, like SDI or the
                    Soviet Union. And these came from Reagan himself, not from his advisors, who
                    were often flustered by them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed somebody who was at the White House who
                        talked about how nervous some of his handlers would be when he was alone
                        with either Brian Mulroney or Margaret Thatcher. No one knew what he would
                        be saying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That may be true with Margaret Thatcher because they were such friends.
                    He trusted her and did not feel obliged to stick to his lines. But in most
                    instances I think Reagan could be trusted more than a real expert on foreign
                    policy like Henry Kissinger. Kissinger felt he needed no one. With him, you
                    never really knew what would be done or agreed to behind closed doors. And you
                    would probably never find out, unless you trusted his memoirs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: They were certainly worried in Moscow at those on-on-one sessions. During
                    that Moscow summit there were two one-on-one sessions and then there were two
                    plenary sessions. The plenary sessions involved the whole delegation, including
                    the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser, and so on. It was a dozen
                    people or so. Those plenary sessions I actually wasn't involved in. I was in the
                    small one-on-one meetings where Gorbachev did try to get these broad
                    declarations. But Reagan resisted. In the end, the sessions became largely
                    non-substantive discussions, and I can't say that any dramatic things were
                    agreed or disagreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this time what were you picking up from your
                        colleagues about Gorbachev? Was it becoming clearer who he who he was and
                        what he was up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was a growing sense that he was something quite significant and
                    that there were important ways in which he really wanted to change things. But
                    certainly no one, including Gorbachev, expected the Soviet Union to fall apart.
                    And this was in 1988, quite near to the end of the Soviet empire. People
                    believed that Gorbachev knew the Soviet Union was in trouble economically and
                    technologically and could not compete with the U.S. and thus he was trying to
                    buy time so that the Soviet Union could be strengthened again. I think that was
                    the dominant view of Gorbachev. But there was still a lot of debate on this. The
                    CIA even hired a psychologist to study Gorbachev's physical gestures and body
                    language to try to get insight into his personality. I spoke with the man, who
                    knew no Russian, but had studied hours of silent films of Gorbachev to try to
                    figure him out. As I recall, he did not come up with any particularly revealing
                    insights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the NSC at the time. In earlier
                        years, under Nixon and then under Carter, you had Henry Kissinger and
                        Brzezinski who both had strong opinions and were very strong operators. By
                        the time you got there you have Frank Carlucci and Colin Powell. This is
                        quite a different NSC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, I think that's true, and that's more like it should be. The NSC was
                    not dominating over the State Department as it was in the Kissinger years. There
                    was a good relationship with George Schultz who I think was an excellent
                    Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel about the influence of the Pentagon?
                        Casper Weinberger was still there. Did you find that there was a pressure
                        there to overplay the Soviet menace to keep up defense budgets and so
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>PERINA: I wouldn't single out the Pentagon because I think in all the
                    departments, as well as in the CIA, there was a conservative side of the house
                    that was still arguing, look, we can't let our guard down. Gorbachev is one man
                    and he can't change the Soviet system. The missiles are still all there, the
                    generals are still all there. We have to keep our guard up. My first boss in the
                    NSC, Fritz Ermarth, was sympathetic to this view. Before the Moscow Summit, we
                    made a lot of effort to try to prepare Reagan for this trip, even to the point
                    that we asked the CIA to make a film for him about Moscow and about the sites he
                    would be visiting. We thought he could particularly relate to a movie. The CIA
                    did make a film under NSC bidding, albeit reluctantly because they seemed to
                    feel it was not part of their mission, and the film was actually pretty
                    disappointing. It was a bunch of clips from travelogues. I remember this because
                    I organized it. I also organized a lunch for him with Soviet experts from all
                    over the United States, academics and outside people ranging from Jim Billington
                    to Richard Pipes. We got them to the White House for lunch with the President.
                    The reason I raise this is because even at this lunch he got a very wide range
                    of interpretations of Gorbachev and his objectives. So it was not surprising
                    that the government also had diverging views.</p>
                <p>The lunch and the film were interesting, however, because they showed how excited
                    Reagan was about his trip to Moscow, and how extensively he wanted to prepare
                    for it. He did somehow see it as a culmination of his presidency. One little
                    anecdote. The first one-on-one meeting at the summit was held in the Kremlin,
                    and it was the first meeting in Moscow between Reagan and Gorbachev as well as
                    between Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev. The scenario was that the two couples
                    would meet together and then the presidents and first ladies would split up for
                    separate meetings. Tom Simons and I had to follow behind Reagan because we were
                    going to be the note takers in the meeting of the presidents. The Soviets always
                    had a way to add drama to these events, and when we arrived at the Kremlin,
                    there was a very high narrow staircase that Reagan and Nancy were supposed to
                    climb in order to meet Gorbachev and Raisa at the top. You could see the Soviet
                    psychology behind it: the U.S. President starts at the bottom and has to walk up
                    to meet Gorbachev. In any case, Reagan and Nancy were walking up the staircase
                    and Tom and I were about 30 feet behind. It was a closed off staircase so I am
                    not sure that Reagan and Nancy were aware that anyone was watching them. In the
                    middle of the staircase they stopped and looked at one another, and then Reagan
                    took Nancy's hand and they walked up the rest of the way holding hands. It was a
                    minor thing but actually very touching because one could sense that they both
                    felt that this was a very special moment for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But when you talked about the one-on-one, you said there
                        wasn't very much substance.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>PERINA: That is true. I wrote most of the talking points for Reagan, and we tried
                    to prepare him to raise issues that he could handle and that would not give
                    openings to Gorbachev to play mischief. So we wanted him to raise the more
                    philosophical issues, particularly freedom of religion, which he liked as an
                    issue and understood. This was still a time when there were church problems in
                    the Soviet Union, persecution of believers and so on. So I wrote a number of
                    talking points for him on freedom of religion, and I remember one passage that
                    said, “A person's love for his religion and for his country is like a person's
                    love for his children and his parents. They are different and complement each
                    other and need not be in conflict.” The idea was, of course, that the state
                    should not feel threatened by the church and by people's devotion to the church.
                    Well, Reagan did raise freedom of religion and there was a brief discussion of
                    it although the above line was never used. This is the kind of general
                    discussion Reagan wanted to have, whereas Gorbachev quickly pulled the
                    declaration of principles out of his pocket and wanted to get agreement on the
                    document. This was the range of the one-on-one meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not to denigrate these meetings because it is
                        important just to have the two leaders talking to one another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That is exactly right. The meetings are important. Indeed, by the time of
                    the Moscow summit I think Reagan had changed his view of the Soviet Union as an
                    evil empire primarily because of his meetings with Gorbachev. He gave a speech
                    in Moscow in which he tried to nuance the evil empire phrase and explain that he
                    had really been speaking about the system and not the people. So leaders getting
                    to know one another and developing their views is very important, even if no
                    substance is discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the note takers or the
                        handlers on the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. They were probably some NSC equivalents, and under the circumstances
                    we just didn't have a chance to interact at all. The interpreters knew one
                    another because they were the same at almost all of the meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel overall about this summit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think it was a useful summit and important symbolically. In the
                    perception of people, it did a lot to reduce the sense of confrontation from
                    Reagan's first term. It influenced Reagan, and I think it influenced Russians
                    about Reagan. He did a lot of things on the trip. He went to a university there,
                    he went to churches, he strolled through Red Square with Gorbachev, he made a
                    lot of speeches and appearances, and I think it did change the dynamics of the
                    relationship and made the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union less dangerous
                    for everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should talk about from your NSC
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Perhaps just one thing. One of my portfolios at the NSC was also Eastern
                    Europe. I made a trip to Poland with then Vice President George Bush, and I also
                    visited the region in early 1988 with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead,
                    who had been given a special brief by George Shultz to follow events there. We
                    made stops that included Sofia, Bucharest, Budapest, Bratislava and Prague. The
                    most interesting of these was the stop in Romania where we took away MFN
                    (Most-Favored Nation Tariff Status) from Ceausescu. Of course, Ceausescu knew
                    what was coming and actually renounced MFN about an hour before meeting with
                    Whitehead, so we could not actually take it away. But I will never forget what a
                    desperate place Romania was under his leadership in those years. There was no
                    heat, no electricity and hardly anything in food shops. People in the Foreign
                    Ministry wore overcoats in their offices. I wandered into a bookshop and almost
                    the only books available were those written by Ceausescu or his wife Elena. Most
                    striking was the fear that everyone so clearly had in their eyes, from people on
                    the street up to officials around Ceausescu. Even we were aggressively followed
                    everywhere by secret police who made no effort to hide their presence. I think
                    it was the closest experience I have had to what it must have been like to live
                    under Stalin in his last years when he went a bit insane and instituted a cult
                    of personality and reign of terror. We were only there about two days but the
                    experience was unforgettable. I have never seen anything equally depressing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the NSC when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I left in the spring of 1989. After George Bush came in I was still at
                    the NSC for a couple of months and then I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sense in the NSC that the change from a
                        president to his vice president would bring any big changes in policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not really, except that we all thought that the Vice President coming in
                    after the President would result in a friendly takeover of the NSC. That did not
                    become the case. I guess it showed the frustration of the vice presidency.
                    George Bush was pretty marginalized as Vice President, and he and Brent
                    Scowcroft did pretty much of a clean sweep in changing the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the story about the transition team at the
                        State Department which was full of people who helped Bush in the election
                        campaign. When Alexander Haig came in as Secretary of State there was a
                        reception for them in the Department and Haig said, “Thank you very much and
                        good luck,” and someone else said “You and you and you stay and the rest of
                        you leave.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>PERINA: Politics is a tough game. But Reagan really was a gentleman. A one minute
                    story about what sort of a person he was. The first time I met him I was going
                    into the Oval Office as a note taker with a delegation, and I had learned that
                    as a note taker you stay out of the way. You are not in the receiving line and
                    you sneak into a chair at the back and sit down and take notes. So that's what I
                    did. We all sat down and Reagan looked around and realized that I hadn't been in
                    the reception line and that he hadn't shaken my hand. He got up and went across
                    the room to me to shake my hand. Of course, as a mid-level FSO, I was pretty
                    startled that the President got up and went across the room to shake my hand.
                    Probably he did not realize that I was the note taker, but it was still
                    indicative of the kind of person he was. Whether one agreed or disagreed with
                    his policies, he was a gentleman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1989 after George Bush took office, where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, I did two short assignments for CSCE and then one long one. The
                    short ones were that I was the deputy head of the U.S. delegations to the London
                    Information Forum and then to the Paris Conference on the Human Dimension. Both
                    of these were about month-long meetings, what were called “experts' meetings” in
                    the CSCE. The London one was headed by Leonard Marks, former director of USIA,
                    and the Paris one was headed by Morris Abrams, the well-known human rights
                    lawyer. I was the deputy to both men. This was in the spring of 1989. Then in
                    the fall we moved to Vienna for three years, where I was the deputy head of the
                    delegation to the CSCE conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures
                    in Europe, or CSBM. This all gets a bit technical, and I know these are a lot of
                    acronyms. The interesting part about Vienna was that this is the vantage point
                    we had when the Cold War ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, in 1989 you're going to the CSCE in Vienna. Can you
                        explain what that was and what you were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We discussed the CSCE earlier because I had worked on that during my
                    first tour in Washington. Since I had this experience, I was chosen by Jack
                    Maresca to be his deputy for the CSBM talks in Vienna. He was the Ambassador,
                    and I was the deputy with the title of Representative. He had been one of the
                    original negotiators of the Helsinki Final Act and was really an expert on the
                    document. And the CSBM talks were a parallel negotiation to the CFE talks in
                    Vienna, which were under the CSCE umbrella but involved only the members of NATO
                    and the Warsaw Pact. Have I lost you completely by now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but explain what the CFE was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PERINA: CFE stood for the negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe, and that
                    was a negotiation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to reduce conventional forces
                    on the continent. It developed from the old Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction
                    Talks or MBFR that had hit a dead end. At the same time, the CSBM talks were
                    intended to be for all 35 CSCE countries, including the neutral and non-aligned
                    countries, in pursuing confidence-building military measures. The talks had to
                    be separated because the participants were different and also the CFE concerned
                    reductions whereas CSBM talks were largely confidence-building. The head of the
                    U.S. delegation to the CFE talks was Jim Woolsey, later to be CIA Director.</p>
                <p>I was in Vienna three years with Jack Maresca, and we negotiated a CSBM agreement
                    but also then initiated the talks on transforming the CSCE after the end of the
                    Cold War into the OSCE or Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
                    Before it had been the Conference and then it became the Organization. This was
                    actually an important development because the U.S. had long resisted any
                    institutionalization of CSCE. We had always feared that if it became
                    institutionalized it would become like the UN, a big bureaucracy. We wanted it
                    to have more of a political impact from periodic conferences, high visibility
                    conferences rather than permanent sessions which after a while nobody pays
                    attention to. Also, a permanent organization could have been more of a
                    competitor to NATO, as the Soviets originally intended. So we had resisted
                    institutionalization but the Europeans always wanted it to promote detente and
                    the Soviets wanted it as well. Once the Cold War ended, we relented and the
                    whole process was transformed into an organization with a permanent secretariat
                    and seat in Vienna. Our delegation was tasked with negotiating this
                    transformation. So while we negotiated CSBM's we also in the last year
                    negotiated the whole initial architecture of the Organization for Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe, the various institutions and the bodies and how it would
                    function and so on. Many of these meetings took place in Prague, so we were
                    often going back and forth between Vienna and Prague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Vienna shortly before the Berlin Wall
                        came down, how would you describe the Soviet attitude and the East German
                        attitude? Were they playing their normal game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I would say in the CSCE they were playing the normal game. None of the
                    Eastern delegations suspected that the collapse of the Warsaw Pact was coming.
                    No one expected it. The Soviets were a little easier to deal with because of
                    Gorbachev and perestroika but the East Germans, for example, were very
                    hard-line. The Hungarians were the easiest to deal with, and the Poles were
                    mixed. No one sensed that anything significant was imminent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Czechs were pretty hard-line, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>PERINA: Oh, yes. They were quite hard-line. But the worst were the East Germans.
                    One story on the many ironies of this period. We had a rotating chairmanship in
                    the CSCE at that time. Different delegations would take turns chairing every
                    meeting of the Permanent Council. By coincidence, I was the acting head of the
                    U.S. delegation and in the chair on the day that the two Germanys merged. This
                    is jumping ahead a little bit. It was toward the end of my assignment in Vienna
                    but on the day that we took the GDR nameplate off the table and East Germany
                    disappeared and West Germany took over. It was remarkable because on the same
                    day the East German Ambassador, or rather former Ambassador, since the country
                    no longer existed, asked to meet with me. He knew I had worked in West Berlin,
                    and he asked if there was any chance of getting employment with the U.S. Mission
                    in Berlin as an expert on East Germany and on a reintegration process. This was
                    the man who for the previous two years had always been the harshest critic of
                    the U.S., the West and West Germany. But clearly he was desperate. German
                    Foreign Minister Genscher, as you know, made the decision that every East German
                    diplomat would be fired. There was not a single one that was integrated into the
                    West German Foreign Ministry, and they were all out of work. But knowing what
                    this Ambassador had been saying about us and the West Germans over the previous
                    two years, it was hard to feel sorry for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you dealing with issues like freedom of movement,
                        freedom of the press and that sort of thing during your time in Vienna?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not in the CSBM negotiations, which were pretty technical and concerned
                    things like observation of military maneuvers and so on, but certainly that was
                    the case in the CSCE and OSCE. Toward the end of my tour, our delegation really
                    had two parallel negotiations going, and the broader CSCE/OSCE ones were the
                    more interesting and productive. Ironically, the CFE talks, which had been
                    Washington's primary focus when I arrived in Vienna, really found themselves in
                    a lot of confusion when the Warsaw Pact came apart because they had been
                    premised on negotiations between the two military blocs. Many things were just
                    turned upside down in those three years. But you are right that in the OSCE
                    context we became very much involved in human rights issues. I remember dealing
                    with the overthrow of Ceausescu in Romania, the beginning of the Yugoslav
                    crisis, all of these things started bubbling up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the working relationship with the Western
                        Europeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>PERINA: This was an issue because of the growing role of the European Union
                    within the OSCE. When I first started working in the CSCE, there was the NATO
                    caucus and that was it. There would be a meeting of the NATO countries prior to
                    CSCE sessions, they would decide on strategy and approach, and that was the
                    limit of Western coordination. Gradually, however, the EU countries decided that
                    they should be meeting as well, and an EU caucus developed parallel to the NATO
                    caucus. By the end of my tour, there was a clear rivalry beginning to develop
                    between the two and an institutional problem as well. The problem was this: the
                    EU caucus would usually meet prior to the NATO caucus and try to develop a
                    common strategy among EU countries. Sometimes this was a grueling process that
                    took many hours. At the end, they would emerge with a fragile consensus and go
                    to the NATO caucus and not be in a position to be very flexible. In effect, the
                    U.S. would get a fait accompli in whatever the EU had decided. The U.S. would
                    not necessarily accept the EU conclusions, and then there would be a standoff
                    between the EU and the non-EU countries, primarily the U.S., within the NATO
                    caucus. There was steadily growing tension between the EU and the U.S. because
                    of this problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel the role of France in particular but also
                        of Germany in this dynamic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: France was always France, and France was always difficult to deal with in
                    the OSCE. They had some good ambassadors there but still they took the French
                    position of generally trying to diminish the U.S. role and to increase the
                    profile of the Europeans. They were the moving force, I think, in getting the
                    European Union to play a more independent role through its caucus. The Germans
                    at that time were still very much dependent on the United States. This was,
                    after all, the time when the negotiations on reunification of Germany were
                    beginning, very sensitive negotiations in which the U.S. played a central role.
                    So the Germans often tried to bridge differences between the U.S. and the
                    EU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of the Turks and the Greeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was very predictable that at almost every CSCE meeting there would be
                    a confrontation between Turkey and Greece as well as Cyprus regarding the
                    Cypriot question. Very often, Cyprus would threaten to withhold consensus on a
                    document because of this issue, but at the end it always relented. It was a
                    periodic ritual that the delegations had to go through, and it always prolonged
                    meetings though usually it did not disrupt them. Most other delegates went for
                    coffee breaks when these three delegations started to speak.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Toward the end of my time in Vienna, after the Soviet Union actually
                    disintegrated, there was another interesting dynamic in the OSCE, and that was
                    deciding whether all of the former republics of the USSR should become members
                    of the organization. The OSCE was by definition a European and trans-Atlantic
                    organization, and many of the newly-independent states, particularly the
                    “stans,” were in Asia. There was a certain debate within the U.S. Government
                    about whether all these Asian states should be admitted. In the end the decision
                    was affirmative, primarily because OSCE was seen as an organization that could
                    draw them to the West and help them to develop democratic institutions. This was
                    how a new, post-Cold War role started to be developed for the OSCE. But of
                    course during the time I was there none of these countries or very few of them
                    were prepared to send delegations to Vienna. They didn't have the personnel,
                    experience, anything. So for the most part their chairs were empty but at times
                    they asked the Russians to represent them for important votes and so on. I
                    remember once that a poor fellow from the Russian delegation ran from chair to
                    chair around the conference room representing each of the countries as we went
                    around the table on an issue. He represented Kazakhstan, and then changed seats
                    to represent Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and so on, giving the consensus of each
                    country. There were some incredibly bizarre things happening in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to early on when the Warsaw Pact started
                        falling apart. How was this being viewed by the U.S. delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, we were all intensely following the news, initially from Hungary,
                    where there was this build-up of East German refugees who were being allowed to
                    go to the West by the Hungarians. Then, of course, the demonstrations started in
                    East Berlin, and shortly thereafter the wall came down. I remember the next day
                    the East German Ambassador was just as white as a sheet when he came in, and it
                    was clear that he could not believe that this had happened. None of us could
                    believe it had happened, although we still did not realize the full impact— that
                    it would lead to the end of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. However,
                    events moved very quickly. We had the Velvet Revolution in Prague and so on.
                    Interestingly enough, no one seemed to fear that the Soviet Union would
                    intervene and try to stop or reverse developments. It was clear that something
                    fundamental had changed that could not be reversed. The Brezhnev Doctrine was
                    dead. At the same time, nobody seriously thought at the time that in the next
                    few years we would achieve the reunification of Germany with a united Germany
                    remaining in NATO. Many people thought the more likely scenario was that Germany
                    would leave NATO in order to achieve reunification, if that was the price that
                    Moscow insisted on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was always that fear for a number of years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>PERINA: Right. The fear was that the Germans would be lured out of NATO with the
                    promise of reunification. Very few people thought that we could attain
                    reunification with the new Germany remaining in NATO. James Baker did pull it
                    off. It was a remarkable achievement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you instructed or knew instinctively to be very
                        careful and not indulge in what is sometimes called triumphalism? In other
                        words, here you are sitting in negotiations between supposedly equal powers
                        including the very mighty Soviet Union and the other side is collapsing.
                        This is a tricky time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, it was a tricky time and, of course, we did try not to become as
                    you say “triumphalist”. At the same time it was the highpoint during my career
                    of America's position in Europe, and really the world. Everyone recognized what
                    had happened. We had won the Cold War and the Soviet Union had lost. Then it
                    merged with other things like the first Iraq War which also happened at that
                    time. This showed America's ability to project military power. We were clearly
                    seen as the one great power in the world and a very important country, a very
                    important delegation. Strange to say, but other delegations did treat us
                    differently, almost immediately. They recognized that there had been a strategic
                    shift in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You see a power such as Poland which is a major country in
                        Eastern Europe. Did you see it begin to exert itself more while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think it was too early. That happened a little bit later. What I saw in
                    my time was the delegations of these countries begin to change. Initially, the
                    delegations were still composed of the same Communist personalities because
                    non-Communist diplomats were not ready to take over. But gradually the
                    delegations began shifting to new ambassadors. Interestingly, however, even the
                    old Communist diplomats very quickly changed their tune. Almost as soon as the
                    Berlin wall fell, it was hard to find a real Communist defender around. By the
                    end of my tour, you could see the advent of ambassadors who came from the ranks
                    of the dissidents in previous years. Then you could clearly see a difference of
                    perspective among the East European diplomats, and it often manifested itself as
                    a very strong anti-Russian attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Russian delegation? How did their
                        delegation respond during this difficult time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>PERINA: I think they were all conflicted. I mean, they put the best face on it.
                    They were among the ones who quickly changed their tune and started saying that
                    this was all good, that they wanted more democracy, that they supported the
                    changes and so on, but you could tell that for the older ones it was very
                    difficult to accept. It was a hundred and eighty degree shift in their world. I
                    think they realized that to survive they had to change as much as they could,
                    and I'm sure for some of them the change was sincere. But then the real shocker
                    for them was the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which no one still expected
                    at this point. Most of them were in shell shock when it came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your instructions from Washington? Was it
                        sort of a confused period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: On the issues we were dealing with, our instructions were generally okay.
                    The State Department bureaucracy did continue functioning. Jack Maresca was in
                    any case the type of ambassador who didn't really care for instructions very
                    much and relied on his own judgment. So I think we managed fairly well. Of
                    course, it was a difficult time just to keep up with events because they moved
                    so quickly and brought so many surprises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a point when somebody pushed the button
                        and said, “Okay, let's have a permanent OSCE organization?” How did this
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: This happened a little more gradually. The Europeans had long been
                    pressing for a permanent OSCE, and we went along gradually. We were still
                    brought along kicking and screaming on some issues. We were always arguing for
                    the minimal amount of institutionalization: the fewest meetings, the least
                    bureaucracy and so on. I think Washington figured “Look, we just won the Cold
                    War. We don't have to be worried about competition to NATO.” I think also there
                    was the beginning of finding a new role for the OSCE. The CSCE, as such, had
                    really become a Cold War institution, a tool that the West used to advance human
                    rights issues in the Soviet bloc. Now people started thinking that an
                    organization would be more useful as a tool for integrating Europe and
                    strengthening democracy in the newly-independent states. A more permanent,
                    empowered institution was necessary for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're thinking of democratizing the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, all the successor states of the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union. The
                    former at least had the structures of independent states but the latter didn't
                    even have that. The OSCE came to be seen as an organization that could help
                    build institutions, democracy, civil society, civilian control of militaries,
                    respect for human rights, all of the things that the CSCE had advocated. So we
                    started coming up with various mechanisms for this. One was to establish OSCE
                    missions in a number of these countries, missions that would monitor human
                    rights problems and minority problems, particularly in the countries that had
                    large ethnic minorities and potential for conflict, of which there were many.
                    Another task was to help organize elections and monitor elections in all of
                    these countries. And of course, there was the former Yugoslavia that had also
                    splintered and the same forms of assistance were required by the newly-created
                    states there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there still concern about excess bureaucratization
                        in this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was always such concern. The bad model was the UN. In Vienna there
                    was a big UN mission with all of the duty-free shops and fancy cafeterias and
                    huge bureaucracies and that was what people really wanted to avoid. But also the
                    business of passing resolutions that nobody paid attention to— that was also
                    something we wanted to avoid. We wanted the OSCE to be lean, flexible and
                    practical in its work. I think to a large degree we succeeded. To this day, the
                    OSCE is leaner than the UN or EU bureaucracies. NATO is difficult to compare
                    because of the military component.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm always interested in French diplomacy. As things were
                        changing, did the French show any different face or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: A lot of that played out within the EU caucus and wasn't always visible
                    to us. I think that French policy objectives remained unchanged in the sense of
                    limiting U.S. influence and strengthening European institutions. But it was
                    harder for them to implement this because the U.S. position had been so
                    strengthened by the end of the Cold War. We had a whole new set of allies within
                    the OSCE in the Central European countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and
                    Hungary who saw us as their liberators from Soviet domination. They had historic
                    distrust of Western Europe and really looked to the United States as their new
                    ally. So all of this made it difficult for the French to be too assertive in
                    trying to limit U.S. influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have good moles within the European caucus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. We did. We had a lot of good moles and that helped us in dealing
                    with the EU. As I mentioned earlier, we had these scenarios where the European
                    Union would come out of its caucus and say that it took them 5 hours of
                    negotiations to reach agreement on some text, and if we changed a single dot it
                    would all come apart. Well, then of course, we changed the dot. And then the
                    whole thing came apart and then there was a new negotiation where we could be
                    genuine players and not just recipients of what the EU had devised. Generally
                    the Europeans were too tired to go back into another EU caucus so we just
                    thrashed it out in the NATO caucus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this was it becoming apparent that
                        the new newly-independent states would at some point come into NATO and the
                        EU? Was that on your minds at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That came a little bit later. As I said, in our time we were just amazed
                    that Germany was able to reunify and remain in NATO but it was too difficult to
                    envision at the time that the other states would be coming into NATO and the EU
                    in the near future. In fairness, I think thought was being given to this at NATO
                    fairly quickly because these NATO partnership programs for the newly-independent
                    states began appearing. In some circles, this again led to the unfortunate view
                    that there was some sort of competition between NATO and the OSCE. This
                    perception has plagued OSCE from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern among other European delegations about
                        Germany unifying and again becoming a threat to its neighbors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think there was a little concern among some delegations like the Poles
                    but it was not significant. I think most people felt that the U.S. presence in
                    Europe and Germany's integration into NATO and the EU really mitigated any
                    German threat to the continent. A much greater fear of these countries remained
                    Russia. It was not seen as a democratic country, it still had a lot of military
                    power, and the danger of its resurgence was perceived as the real threat by the
                    Central and Eastern Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Austria play a special role as the host of the
                        OSCE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The Austrians were good hosts but did not have an exceptional diplomatic
                    role in this period. What Austria did provide just thanks to its location was
                    the first glimpse of the West for many East Europeans. In the first few weeks
                    after the borders opened, it was fascinating to see on weekends these convoys of
                    hundreds of buses bringing Hungarians and Czechs to Vienna just to stroll for
                    the day. The buses would park in stadiums because there were so many of them and
                    literally thousands of these people would walk up and down Mariahilferstrasse
                    and other streets looking at the shops, and I mean just looking because they did
                    not have money to really buy much. It was a very direct reminder of the end of
                    the Cold War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever make any contact during this period with

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Oh yes, I had been in steady contact with them, and my uncle and a number
                    of cousins and their families came down to Vienna for short visits. I, of
                    course, had been traveling to Prague regularly, both on private visits and for
                    OSCE meetings. My parents also came from the U.S. to visit us in Vienna and made
                    visits to Czechoslovakia—in my father's case, his first visit since he left over
                    40 years earlier.</p>

                <p>PERINA: I can't tell you that I recall any particular role by these delegations.
                    It probably played out within the EU caucus. The two countries that were
                    consistently very helpful as coordinators were the Dutch and the Norwegians.
                    Both had very skilled diplomats with a lot of OSCE experience. The Dutch were
                    also particularly helpful on human rights issues.</p>

                    providing developmental assistance.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: 1993. I had a year in the Senior Seminar from 1992 to 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was ready to decompress for a year, and I had always heard good things
                    about the Senior Seminar. It was a great year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is focused on getting to know the United States. Did
                        you find any parts of your travel or study particularly interesting to

                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>PERINA: It was all interesting and, as you say, it focused on the United States.
                    We visited Mexico City and Canada but did not make any overseas trips. The whole
                    idea was to acquaint diplomats with the United States and current issues within
                    the United States so that we could better represent the country overseas. We did
                    things like visiting Alaska and flying the length of the oil pipeline, visiting
                    the New York stock exchange, patrolling the Texas-Mexican border with border
                    police, cruising with police patrols in Baltimore, visiting Boeing in Seattle,
                    Coca Cola in Atlanta, an aircraft carrier and nuclear submarine, a missile silo,
                    you name it. We saw every part of the United States and criss-crossed the
                    country several times. It was an excellent program which unfortunately no longer
                    exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my impression as well when I took it. Anyway,
                        where did you go after the Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The Seminar ended in the summer of 1993, and I went to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>PERINA: There was no Ambassador. Warren Zimmermann had left the year before, and
                    he had left the DCM, Bob Rackmales, as Charg�. The war was underway. Yugoslavia
                    had broken up. We had broken off diplomatic relations with Serbia Montenegro,
                    although we had an Embassy there. Bob Rackmales had negotiated that the Embassy
                    and staff would continue to have diplomatic rights and privileges but in a legal
                    sense we did not have diplomatic relations because we did not recognize
                    Serbia-Montenegro as the successor state to Yugoslavia. It was a very strange
                    and unique relationship. Bob Rackmales was Charg� d'Affaires but had been
                    assigned originally to the DCM position, and I was initially assigned to the DCM
                    slot as his replacement. However, I went to post to be the Charg� d'Affaires and
                    was reassigned after my first year to be the Chief of Mission as a permanent
                    Charg�, so that the DCM slot could be vacated and filled. By then it was clear
                    that we would not have normal diplomatic relations, and an accredited
                    ambassador, for a long time. When I was assigned to the job, I was told in
                    Washington by my personnel counselor that there was a 50-50 chance that I would
                    be closing the Embassy, that is to say that we would completely break off
                    relations with Belgrade. This was one of the reasons that there weren't too many
                    people anxious to go. The country was under UN sanctions. One could not even fly
                    in because all international flights were cut off as part of the sanctions. I
                    had to fly into Budapest and proceed to Belgrade by car. It was a very, very
                    strange situation. The Embassy itself had been downsized by about 50% when
                    Warren Zimmermann left so it had a much smaller staff than previously. I knew I
                    would be working under very difficult conditions, under the threat of closing
                    down the Embassy on short notice, and with a staff that was greatly downsized.
                    There were also security concerns and plans for military evacuation of the
                    Embassy if necessary. I had several special security people on the staff whose
                    only job was to prepare for such an evacuation and be there to help carry it
                    out. They had videotaped and mapped the residence and entire compound inside and
                    out, identified landing areas for helicopters and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was there from 1993 to the early spring of 1996. I ended up being there
                    about two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went, what was your impression of the situation
                        in the former Yugoslavia? What was our policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>PERINA: This was a time when the Bosnian War was going full force and all the
                    reports of atrocities were hitting the Western media. These included the reports
                    on the concentration camps, the mass rapes, the use of rape as an instrument of
                    war, the sniper killings in Sarajevo, and so on. All of these reports were
                    coming out and arousing public opinion, generally in an anti-Serb direction
                    because most of the publicized atrocities seemed to be committed against Muslims
                    by Serbs. This was the time when three or four State Department desk officers in
                    a row resigned from the Department to protest that the U.S. was not taking
                    stronger action against Serbia. There was a feeling that the U.S. should be
                    doing more to stop these atrocities, that it should intervene against the Serbs.
                    It was a horrible time and horrible things were happening. The U.S. had started
                    reacting to this, and military action by NATO was not ruled out. This was one of
                    the reasons I was told there was a 50-50 chance of closing the Embassy.</p>
                <p>There was also continuing tension over Kosovo. In December 1992, six months
                    before I went out, Deputy Secretary Eagleburger gave Milosevic what came to be
                    known as the “Christmas warning” that we would take action against Serbia proper
                    in retaliation for any move against Kosovo. So U.S.-Serb relations were very
                    bad, as you can imagine, and the State Department increasingly felt under
                    pressure to do more to stop the killing in Bosnia. Our initial approach had been
                    to try to stay out and let the Europeans take the lead. We felt that this was a
                    good example of a regional conflict that the European Union should try to
                    handle. But the European Union was not doing very much, and pressure was
                    mounting on the U.S. by domestic public opinion to do something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just finished interviewing Ron Neitzke. He served in
                        Belgrade before but he was in Zagreb as Consul General at this time and then
                        made Charg� for a year. He was saying that he very much felt unhappiness
                        from the Department of State that he was reporting too many of these
                        atrocities because the U.S. Government didn't want to get involved. He said
                        he also felt he was up against what he called the Belgrade mafia, which was
                        Eagleburger, Scowcroft and others with Yugoslav experience who had served
                        there and felt close to the Serbs. Did you encounter any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was ironic because there were a lot of Yugoslav experts at the top
                    levels of the U.S. Government. But I did not feel such pressure. Of course, I
                    was reporting from Serbia and most of the atrocities were happening in Bosnia.
                    So I was not in a position to report on them. From Belgrade, we did follow
                    developments in Kosovo and kept Washington informed on all reports of atrocities
                    there. I did not get any signals that such information should not be reported.
                    On the contrary, there was a lot of interest in Kosovo in our Congress so it was
                    important for the Department to be fully up to speed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This is where everything was happening. Were you
                        given any special instructions when you went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>PERINA: Apart from the possible need to close the Embassy, the instructions were
                    just to survive. The UN sanctions were among the toughest possible. There were
                    no airplane flights, nothing was supposedly allowed in. Now, of course, it was a
                    porous border and you could buy a lot of stuff, but for the average person it
                    was very difficult. For example, you couldn't buy gasoline. People had to go to
                    Budapest and bring back gasoline in milk cartons, which they then often sold at
                    roadside stands. There was also this rampant inflation going on as a result of
                    the sanctions. When I arrived, the staff took me to a welcoming dinner in a
                    restaurant and I couldn't believe how it was paid for. The economic counselor
                    opened an attach� case that was just filled with stacks of bills, and he paid
                    for the dinner with all of these bills. He just put them on the table, and we
                    had to wait about 15 minutes while the waiters counted them. This inflation
                    continued through my tenure because of the sanctions. Currency was continuously
                    being devalued and reprinted in higher and higher denominations. The largest
                    single bill that was issued in my time there was 500 billion dinars, that's
                    billion and not million. I have never yet seen a single bill of a higher
                    denomination, even from the German inflation after World War I. When this bill
                    was issued it was worth about $10. Within a week it was worth a dollar and
                    within about 10 days it was worth a nickel. I have a stack of them which I kept
                    as souvenirs. Basically, Yugoslav money became meaningless. Initially, of
                    course, some people also profited by paying off debts and mortgages in worthless
                    currency. There were rumors that Milosevic had paid off the mortgage on his
                    personal house for a few hundred dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did people survive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>PERINA: There was a black market primarily in German marks and to some degree in
                    dollars. Most shop owners wanted to be paid in marks. If a person only had
                    Yugoslav dinars, it was very difficult. A barter economy developed where people
                    from the countryside paid with produce for manufactured goods and so on. There
                    continued to be a stream of Western currency coming into the country from the
                    many Serb guest workers in Western Europe, and especially Germany, who sent
                    money back to their families. This basically sustained an entire black economy
                    in hard currency. When I came back to the Department on consultations a couple
                    of times, I brought back examples of the Serb currency—the bills denominated in
                    millions and billions of dinars. People loved them, and Warren Christopher even
                    passed some around at one of his morning staff meetings, as evidence of how the
                    sanctions were working. But there was a flip side to the story. The sanctions
                    destroyed the currency but the economy continued to function in some remarkable
                    ways. For example, there continued to be a McDonalds's in Belgrade through the
                    entire sanction period. It was no longer under franchise and had to procure the
                    ingredients for their products locally, but one could not taste a difference
                    from any other McDonald's hamburger. If one had hard currency, it was still
                    possible to buy almost anything, including new Mercedes automobiles smuggled
                    into the country. There were, of course, many criminal elements who soon figured
                    out how to make such a system profitable for themselves through smuggling and
                    similar activity. The sanctions thus contributed to a real criminalization of
                    the society. Gangsters and criminals became wealthy and rose to the top, while
                    average people suffered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the people eat and procure basic necessities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think a lot of people relied on communities, on social contacts, on
                    family. People in the countryside could raise their own food and were relatively
                    self sufficient. They were less affected by the sanctions. Many city dwellers
                    had come within one or two generations from villages where they still had
                    relatives who could help them get food. Others relied on remittances from abroad
                    for hard currency. Serbs are also very inventive and clever. They are survivors,
                    like everyone else in the Balkans. In most cases, they found ways to beat the
                    system, though it was hard.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The Embassy people were, of course, in a very privileged position. We had the
                    hard currency, we had the ability to bring in gasoline, food and other
                    commodities for Embassy use, so we did not really suffer. But some things were
                    difficult. For example, we could not use the banking system for Embassy
                    transactions because Serb banks were also under sanctions and thus had no links
                    to foreign banks. Everything was on a cash basis. Even salaries of our local
                    employees were paid in cash. About every two weeks, we sent a car to Budapest
                    that would bring back tens of thousands of dollars in cash, sometimes over a
                    hundred thousand dollars. The cars were driven by Serb employees of the Embassy
                    and had an American on board but no guards. They thus aroused no suspicion or
                    interest. The whole system was based on secrecy. Otherwise, of course, local
                    criminal warlords like the infamous Arkan would quickly have targeted these
                    cars, and probably no number of guards could have protected them. At one point
                    we had to put a new roof on the Embassy residence because it was leaking. This
                    was a major repair and cost over a hundred thousand dollars. A car came from
                    Budapest with the cash in a suitcase, and we paid for it that way. I remember
                    telling Dick Holbrooke this story when I first met him in Budapest after he was
                    nominated to be Assistant Secretary. He thought it was fascinating and already
                    then took a special interest in the Yugoslav conflict. I spent an hour telling
                    him stories from Belgrade, and that was how we first got to know one another. I
                    just happened to be passing through Budapest when he was there with his wife,
                    and I asked to meet with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Embassy was still in the same old compound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was that same building, covering an entire block. We still used the
                    main chancery but there were a lot of empty apartments in the other wings
                    because the staff had been so downsized. The commissary was still active as well
                    as the large cafeteria. In my first year, I was there without my wife so that my
                    younger daughter, Alexandra, could finish high school in Virginia. I lived in
                    the DCM residence because the main residence was under repair. That was the most
                    difficult and bleakest year. In the second year, my wife joined me, and we moved
                    to the main Embassy residence, which as you know is a beautiful building with a
                    huge pool, tennis courts, a wonderful property. It was without a doubt the
                    nicest residence we lived in through my entire career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a staff did you have? Did you have the
                        equivalent of a DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: By and large, there was an excellent staff of very committed people. My
                    first year I did not have a formal DCM because I was in the DCM position but I
                    asked Jim Swigert, the head of the economic and political Section, to serve as
                    the acting DCM. He was outstanding and helped me immensely because he had been
                    there the previous year and provided continuity. When I moved into the chief of
                    mission position as a permanent Charg� d'Affaires, I did recruit a DCM who was
                    Larry Butler.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received by the Serbs when you got to
                        Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Within a week or so of my arrival, I received my first instruction to
                    deliver a demarche to Milosevic. I had never met him. We did not recognize him
                    as president of Yugoslavia since we did not recognize Serbia-Montenegro as the
                    successor state to former Yugoslavia. We did accept him as President of Serbia,
                    and in that sense were allowed to call him “President.” I was not an ambassador,
                    and he knew that was done intentionally so as not to recognize him as a head of
                    state with any presentation of credentials. I think Bob Rackmales had not seen
                    him for quite a while before he left. So Milosevic really had not met with an
                    American diplomat for some time. I put in a request to see him in order to
                    deliver the message from Washington. Later in the same day, we received a
                    response that Milosevic would not receive me and that we should just send over
                    the message in written form. I knew if I did that, it would set a precedent and
                    make it difficult for me to ever get a meeting with him. I decided that we
                    wouldn't send the message in written form. Instead, we sent back word that since
                    I had been instructed to deliver the message personally to him, I would have to
                    report his refusal to see me back to Washington and ask for new instructions.
                    This was a bluff, of course, because Washington had not instructed me personally
                    to deliver the message and would have accepted delivery of the message to him in
                    any form. And I would have hated to tell the Department that I delayed
                    delivering the first message assigned to me. But I decided just to tell
                    Milosevic this and to wait 24 hours before sending the demarche in written
                    form.</p>
                <p>Well, the bluff worked. About three hours after we said that I would not deliver
                    the message in writing, word came back that he would receive me that afternoon.
                    I went over and I had my first meeting with Milosevic. Jim Swigert came along as
                    the note taker. I delivered the demarche orally and also left a non-paper with
                    the talking points to make sure he got the exact wording from Washington. This
                    was the pattern I followed with all subsequent demarches. In fact, this first
                    meeting ended with him telling me that he would receive me whenever I asked to
                    see him. I never again had difficulty getting a meeting with him. He clearly
                    wanted to engage with the United States and concluded that he could do so
                    through me.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I cannot remember the exact content of that first demarche but it was along the
                    same vein as numerous other messages I delivered that first year—basically all
                    warning him against interference in Bosnia and sometimes warning him very
                    bluntly that the U.S. would take action if Serbia continued to support the
                    Bosnian Serbs militarily. I probably had well over a dozen meetings with him
                    that first year. On the first few, I took Jim Swigert along but then I started
                    seeing him one-on-one because he spoke more openly. His English was fluent so
                    there was no need for interpreters. As I got to know him, the bizarre thing was
                    that he was actually rather engaging. I think Dick Holbrooke found this later as
                    well. It was quite intentional on Milosevic's part. He wanted to engage the U.S.
                    because he knew that we were key to Western policy in the region. Dealing with
                    him was very informal and completely unlike dealing with some stuffy head of
                    state. In the meetings, he loved to drink Johnny Walker Black just straight on
                    the rocks. He was a chain smoker and smoked these cigarillos, not cigarettes but
                    sort of small cigars. For a few months that first year, he tried to quite
                    smoking and complained of how difficult it was. He later started the habit again
                    and smoked quite a bit by the time I was leaving Belgrade.</p>
                <p>It took a while for someone to really see evidence of how strange he was. He was
                    very skilled in ole playing. At first he would try to impress visitors with what
                    a regular guy he was—drinking, smoking, and being very informal. He would stress
                    his background as a banker and his contacts with American bankers when he
                    visited the United States. He would drop names of New York bankers he allegedly
                    knew and ask how they were. But then gradually, one could see that he was very
                    strange. He rarely showed any emotion, even when discussing immense human
                    suffering and tragedy. This was not only in relation to discussion of Muslims or
                    Croats, but also to Serbs. I remember seeing him at the time the Serbs were
                    expelled from the Krajina in Croatia, and there were these caravans coming into
                    Belgrade of displaced Serbs with all their possessions on wagons and no place to
                    go. I remember meeting with him, and he did not appear particularly concerned
                    about them. There was no emotion about the tragedy and enormity of the conflict
                    going on next door. In part, he wanted to show that he was very tough. But there
                    was a genuine lack of compassion that was truly frightening and that Warren
                    Zimmermann also described in his book.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The other unusual thing that I soon learned about him was that he never flinched.
                    Some of the demarches that I had to deliver during that first year were very,
                    very tough as compared to normal diplomatic exchanges. In most countries I would
                    probably have been expelled if I said those kinds of things to a president. The
                    gist of some of these messages was that we think you are a war criminal and
                    we're going to bomb the hell out of you unless you stop doing so and so. I am of
                    course exaggerating, and they obviously did not use that language, but that was
                    the unmistakable gist of the messages, particularly as Washington got more and
                    more frustrated and angered with Milosevic. And I always delivered the full and
                    exact text of the demarche. I summarized it orally and then gave him the written
                    text, which he always read before responding. No matter how tough or threatening
                    the message was, he would always just look up after reading it and say calmly
                    “Well, you know, this is not true,” and begin discussing it as though we were
                    discussing the weather. He would never flinch and never get angry or show
                    emotion. I think the intent again was to give the impression of being tough and
                    unafraid himself. He would also look directly into your eyes when speaking or
                    listening, and lean forward very close to give the impression of listening
                    intently. It was a fairly intense look, and his eyes never wandered, but it was
                    not a threatening or angry look but rather a type of “I am not afraid” look.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could almost say he was a psychopath.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well I am not a psychiatrist but he was certainly strange and unlike any
                    other person I have ever dealt with. There were a couple of other strange things
                    that later on became even more apparent. There was never any staff that you
                    could see around him. I would come to his office, and the only people I ever saw
                    were his bodyguards and one assistant named Goran Milinovic. I never saw anyone
                    else—not a secretary, a receptionist, or any staffer other than Goran. Goran was
                    this large muscular fellow with a beard, and he functioned as everything,
                    including note taker. He would take copious notes at every meeting but he wrote
                    so quickly that I cannot imagine they were legible. I think it was all for show.
                    I don't believe Milosevic wanted notes of most of his meetings. When I came
                    alone, then Goran did not sit-in on the meetings, and they were only one-on-one.
                    This did change a bit later when Bob Frasure, our Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    from Washington, started coming. In those meetings sometimes Milan Milutinovic,
                    the Foreign Minister, and Chris Spiro who was an American advisor of Milosevic,
                    would join. But the whole atmosphere of these sessions was very strange. Most
                    heads-of-state want entourages to show their importance. With Milosevic, it was
                    just the reverse.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The most bizarre episode I recall with Milosevic came one evening when he called
                    up and asked me to join him for dinner. It was very strange to be invited like
                    this by him, and to this day I do not know what he was trying to achieve other
                    than to get closer to the United States and show how he wanted to work with us.
                    This was in the period when Bob Frasure had started making visits to Belgrade,
                    and the U.S. was starting to engage as the primary mediator of the Yugoslav
                    conflict, replacing the Europeans. So Milosevic knew that the U.S. had become
                    the key player on what happens in Yugoslavia. He called up, even though Bob
                    Frasure was not in town at the time, and asked me to come over to one of the
                    country houses and have dinner with him. We were having dinner, and he was his
                    usual, chatty self, giving the appearance of a perfectly normal person. And then
                    in the middle of the conversation he said, “Did you know that Warren Zimmermann
                    tried to have me assassinated?” I was stunned. I could not believe he said that
                    and thought that he was perhaps testing me in some way. I answered “Mr.
                    President, I know Warren Zimmermann. I know American policy. I don't want you to
                    believe that. It isn't true.” He said, “No, no. It's absolutely true. I have
                    evidence that Warren Zimmermann was plotting with Vuk Draskovic to have me
                    assassinated and we have tapes to prove this.” Vuk Draskovic was probably the
                    most prominent dissident in Serbia at that time, and I am sure Warren Zimmermann
                    met with him, but the assassination charges were of course absurd and indicative
                    of Milosevic's paranoia. From that time on I realized that he was in a
                    completely different world. But it took a while, and incidents like this, to
                    really understand how he saw the world and how paranoid he was because he was
                    generally so good at being able to cover it up. I think he genuinely believed
                    the Zimmermann story, though I have no idea what kinds of tapes he was talking
                    about. I never got around to telling Warren Zimmermann that story. I'm sure he
                    would have been amused by it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If he was so out of it, did Milosevic really understand
                        what was happening in Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>PERINA: That I think he did, although of course he always tried to give the
                    reverse impression— that he was an outsider looking in, just like all the rest
                    of us. I remember that when I raised Srebrenica with him, the position that he
                    took was roughly: “Why are you coming to me? Why do you think I am responsible?
                    I'm doing my best to try to calm Mladic but Bosnia is not my country. The United
                    States itself says this is a separate country now, an independent country. Why
                    do you come to me?” This was his basic response. The difficulty there was that
                    we did not actually have a smoking gun to tie him to the events in Bosnia. Even
                    later at the Hague Tribunal they had the problem of proving that he was linked
                    to these events because they never found the smoking gun. When Milosevic did
                    agree to take some action, he would portray it as almost a favor to us and a
                    demonstration of how he also wanted to end the fighting in Bosnia. Again, during
                    one of the Srebrenica demarches after the city fell, he said he would do his
                    best to prevent any reprisals and that he would call Mladic. He picked up the
                    phone and asked somebody to get Mladic for him. I remember he left the room for
                    about ten minutes and then came back and said, “I talked to Mladic. He's crazy
                    but I conveyed your warning to him.” This was typical. For the most part, he
                    didn't defend Mladic or the other Bosnian Serbs. He would tell me Mladic was
                    crazy but that he tried to convince him to stay calm and not overreact. During
                    Srebrenica, he said that Mladic promised him that he would not harm the people
                    of Srebrenica. But whether he actually called Mladic or did not call Mladic, I
                    have no idea. I suspect he did not. It was probably all political theater to
                    appease us and make himself look like a good guy who shared our concerns.
                    Unfortunately, we now know that Mladic did do terrible things to the people of
                    Srebrenica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever answer, “Well, okay. If you have no control,
                        these aren't your people, then you obviously have no objection to our going
                        in and bombing the hell out of them?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I don't think we ever put it in those terms but it was certainly implied
                    that we would use military force if needed. But we did not want to let Milosevic
                    off the hook by accepting his argument that he wasn't responsible. Part of the
                    difficulty with our policy, and why it was a difficult line to maintain, was
                    that we were trying to maintain that Bosnia was a fully independent country in
                    which Serbia had no right to intervene and yet at the same time asking Milosevic
                    to intervene by restraining Mladic and the Bosnian Serbs. There is a bit of a
                    contradiction there, not a full contradiction but a bit. He exploited this a lot
                    with this position of “Why do you come to me?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got back to the Embassy and sat with your
                        colleagues, did you feel Milosevic was really running the show in Bosnia or
                        did you think that he was perhaps complicit but not in control of the
                        Bosnian Serbs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>PERINA: To be very honest, I did not know. I don't think Washington really knew
                    but our best guess was that it was a mixture of the two. In certain ways
                    Milosevic was certainly helping the Bosnian Serbs. Serbia provided military
                    support, financial support, logistical support and so on. Some of this came
                    through government channels but also a lot came from private groups and militias
                    that sprang up, like Arkan's “Tigers.” So how much influence this gave Milosevic
                    over the Bosnian Serbs, or how long they could have continued to fight without
                    Serbian support, is very difficult to gauge. Milosevic was complicit but can one
                    say he was responsible for specific actions, like the slaughter of the Muslim
                    men after the fall of Srebrenica? Did he know about that? Did he concur with
                    that? I don't know. We don't know. Very frankly even later when he was on trial
                    in The Hague and I was interviewed in The Hague by the prosecutors, it was clear
                    that they also did not have a smoking gun on this. Certainly Milosevic bears
                    much responsibility for the war as a whole because of his actions in starting
                    the conflict but to what degree he exercised control over specific actions after
                    the conflict started is a very difficult question.</p>
                <p>Part of the reason that we didn't have a smoking gun was this incredibly strange
                    way that he operated. I mentioned earlier how there was never a staff one could
                    see in his offices in Belgrade. I visited dozens of times and never saw any
                    infrastructure there. It was like sitting in a deserted building. This was even
                    the case later during my tour when Bob Frasure, the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    responsible for Yugoslavia, started coming to Belgrade, and to a large degree
                    also when Holbrooke started coming. Bob Frasure and I often discussed how
                    bizarre this was. In one instance, Milosevic invited Frasure and me to a country
                    house outside of Belgrade for discussions. We put together a draft list of some
                    points and wanted to make a copy. We asked if there was a copying machine we
                    could use. Milosevic answered “I don't have a copying machine here.” This was in
                    the country residence of the President. There was no staff and he claimed there
                    wasn't a copier. He said, “I have a FAX” and in the end we made a copy of it by
                    faxing it to ourselves. When Bob and I were leaving, we commented to each other
                    on how incredible this was. This was the President of the country in one of his
                    residences, and there was not a copying machine in the house. This again shows
                    why it was difficult later to find a smoking gun. Milosevic greatly limited the
                    number of people he kept around himself, and he really avoided paper. He did not
                    like paper. He always claimed he did things by phone or that he talked to
                    people, that he talked to Mladic or something like that. At least in our
                    presence you never saw any paper that he had on his desk or anywhere.</p>
                <p>And of course participation in meetings with him was very restricted. When Bob
                    Frasure made visits, Milosevic would at most have three other people in the
                    room: his assistant Goran Milinovic, whom I mentioned; his Foreign Minister
                    Milan Milutinovic, and then for a while this strange person Chris Spiro. He was
                    a Greek American. He was an activist in the Democratic Party from New Hampshire
                    who had at one time served in the New Hampshire state legislature. He was
                    somehow engaged by Milosevic as an advisor. I always assumed it was part of
                    Milosevic's effort to try to find ways to relate to the Americans better, and he
                    thought that having an American citizen on his side would help him achieve
                    this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was purpose of these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I have to give a little background here. It started when Holbrooke became
                    the Assistant Secretary for Europe and recognized that our policy of isolating
                    Milosevic and just delivering threatening demarches to him was not working. A
                    decision was made to send out Bob Frasure to engage with Milosevic as an envoy
                    from Washington and to try to elicit his help in ending the conflict. Initially,
                    there was not a specific agenda to these meetings. They were exploratory and
                    designed to show Milosevic that the U.S. might engage with him in a more
                    positive way if he really proved helpful on Bosnia. We did, with Bob, eventually
                    work out a set of broad principles on how to end the conflict, which in fact
                    became the basis of the Dayton Agreement. These principles were very broad
                    initially and primarily designed to draw Milosevic into a process and get him
                    engaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still a period when the Europeans were trying to
                        play a role in resolving the conflict. What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, the Europeans were still talking about finding a solution but in
                    fact they were doing very little. The whole European Union effort largely
                    collapsed. One of the reasons, however, was that Milosevic did not really want
                    to deal with the Europeans. He on occasion saw the British Charg� d'Affaires
                    Ivar Roberts, but otherwise he made no effort to engage with the Europeans. He
                    told us that he wanted to resolve the conflict with the Americans because only
                    we were objective toward all the parties and did not have favorites, in the way
                    that, for example, the Germans favored the Croats. He said that only we were
                    fair and could be trusted. There was, of course, a lot of flattery in this. I
                    think Milosevic also assumed that if he made a deal with the Americans, the
                    Europeans would all follow, and he was correct in this. An interesting side
                    point is how he denigrated the Russians in discussions with us. He did have
                    meetings with the Russian Ambassador, and the Russians were the most vocal
                    international supporters of Serbia. That is why they had an ambassador and not a
                    charg� d'affaires—they had no qualms in giving Serbia diplomatic recognition.
                    But when I asked Milosevic about his dealings with the Russians, he would say,
                    “The Russians are useless. They've got their own problems. They're not doing
                    anything. They can't help in this.”</p>
                <p>The Russian position was also interesting. I met a few times with the Russian
                    Ambassador, who was not a particularly friendly fellow and did not have much
                    contact with the rest of the diplomatic corps. Clearly, the Russians had some
                    agenda in the region but they were very weak and had just lost their empire.
                    They could not be expected to play a powerful role. But what was interesting was
                    how they often misread the situation in the Balkans. Putting their money on
                    almost full support of Milosevic was not a way to gain influence in the region.
                    And later, the Russians completely misread and underestimated the problem of
                    Kosovo, though many other Europeans did that as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact between your Embassy in Belgrade
                        and the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not very much, frankly. We read each other's cables but did not
                    coordinate in any special fashion. I did communicate on occasion with Peter
                    Galbraith when he became the Ambassador to Croatia. We met at one of the
                    Department's chief of mission meetings, and I in fact invited him to visit
                    Belgrade, which he did and he met Milosevic. Then we were together quite a bit
                    in Dayton. I think he did a very good job in Zagreb and respect him for holding
                    the Croats to account for the expulsion of the Serbs from Krajina. It took
                    courage to do that, and Peter did do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run across Mrs. Milosevic who was a power in
                        her own way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: She certainly was, and she was much talked about for her alleged
                    influence over Milosevic. She was also joked about as a bit of a kook and dragon
                    lady combined. I never in my two and one half years there met her. I don't think
                    I even saw her. But I did get the sense that Milosevic was really close to her,
                    and that she really did have a lot of influence over him. He had pictures of her
                    in his office. They stood out in what was otherwise almost a barren room.One of
                    the more interesting people I did meet in Belgrade was Milovan Djilas, who was
                    still alive when I arrived though he died about a year later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: He had been a world figure, and I had studied about him in graduate
                    school so I wanted to meet him. He was living in a modest Belgrade apartment,
                    just like any other Serb. He had no influence and was not at all in the public
                    spotlight. Many Serbs just considered him an old Communist. It was hard to
                    imagine when you met him that this was the person who had had numerous meetings
                    with Stalin and lived through so much. He was still intellectually very alert
                    but not engaged in a serious way in contemporary politics. When I asked him what
                    he thought U.S. policy toward Serbia should be, he responded that we should just
                    bomb Milosevic, whom he described as a terrible man. He criticized the sanctions
                    for punishing the wrong people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Milosevic was the name of the game. All of the other people whom I met
                    there— his ministers, generals, and so on— were total cronies as far as I could
                    see. I dealt almost exclusively with Milosevic. I had the access and could see
                    him or call him whenever needed. On occasion I dealt with the Foreign Minister,
                    Milan Milutinovic, but really just on secondary issues.</p>
                <p>I should mention, however, that when I first arrived in Belgrade I was also
                    responsible for Macedonia. Even though it had already declared independence from
                    Serbia, we had not yet opened an Embassy there, and it was still being covered
                    by the Embassy in Belgrade. So I made a trip down to Skopje and met with the
                    President, Kiro Gligorov. He struck me as an impressive person who was doing his
                    best to act responsibly and with restraint to continued border provocations by
                    Serbia. We suspected that Milosevic was trying to foment a conflict that would
                    allow him to intervene in Macedonia and bring it back under Serbia's fold.
                    Gligorov was in a very tough position because Macedonia was so weak in
                    comparison to Serbia but he kept steady nerves and never overreacted. I have
                    often said that in my view Rugova in Kosovo and Gligorov in Macedonia were the
                    two most responsible and impressive leaders in all of former Yugoslavia at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the Serb society in which you as a
                        diplomat were moving? What were you getting from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: You know, it was hard to come into contact with what you would call the
                    average Serb. I dealt primarily with two opposing communities—on the one hand
                    the government consisting largely of just Milosevic, and on the other hand the
                    dissident and opposition community. This consisted of opposition party leaders,
                    NGO leaders, reformist intellectuals, representatives of the very limited
                    independent media that existed, and so on. These were the people I had most
                    often as guests in the residence. Some of the human rights activists in
                    particular, like Sonia Biserko or Natasha Kandic, were very courageous people
                    but they had little influence on the larger political scene. Their influence
                    came much later, after Milosevic's downfall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Vuk Draskovic? He was quite a name at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>PERINA: He was probably the best-known dissident in the West. Milosevic
                    contributed to that by having thugs beat him up very seriously shortly before my
                    arrival. I knew Vuk well but considered him a little out of his element as a
                    political leader. He did not really understand politics and came up with very
                    strange ideas and suggestions. He was a writer and a poet, and not a serious
                    political thinker. The most impressive opposition political leader I knew was
                    Zoran Djindjic. He had been an exchange student in Germany and seemed to me to
                    be the most astute of the opposition figures. We had him at our house many
                    times. He in fact became Prime Minister in the post-Milosevic era and was very
                    instrumental in shipping Milosevic off to the Hague. Then he was assassinated by
                    Serb nationalists, which was a big loss for Serbia.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived, I also met Vojislav Kostunica, another opposition leader
                    at that time who subsequently became both Prime Minister and President of
                    post-Milosevic Serbia. At the time I knew him, he was completely without
                    influence or power. We met once, and it was not a good meeting. He was a strong
                    Serb nationalist who did not hide that he disliked American policy toward
                    Serbia. He was a very frustrated and angry person. He did not have any
                    constituency or much influence during my entire time in Belgrade.</p>
                <p>I also went a couple of times to see Patriarch Pavle, who was the head of the
                    Serbian Orthodox church. He was a very frail, elderly man but very influential
                    in the country. We wanted him to condemn some of the things happening in Bosnia,
                    the sniper shootings of civilians and so on. He listened to my arguments but
                    would not say anything remotely critical of the Bosnian Serb forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Montenegro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Montenegro was interesting because amidst all the other developments at
                    the time, it was always toying with the idea of breaking away from Serbia and
                    becoming independent. There was this tension between Belgrade and Podgorica, the
                    Montenegrin capital, always in the background. The fact is that Montenegrins
                    were split on the issue of independence almost 50-50. Contrary to what some
                    believe, U.S. policy was not repeat not to support Montenegrin independence. We
                    felt this could lead to yet another war in the region. I visited Montenegro
                    several times to talk to local politicians and get a sense of the mood.
                    Fortunately, no serious problem with Montenegro erupted in my time. The
                    situation became much more serious in later years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was happening with Kosovo in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>PERINA: Kosovo was a whole other story. The entire diplomatic corps in Belgrade
                    talked a lot about Kosovo but the U.S. took it most seriously. We were always
                    worried about Kosovo. The conventional wisdom was that it would blow up someday,
                    but no one knew when. The fact that it had not blown up, however, invariably led
                    to it being relegated to the back burner. People were just too focused on
                    Bosnia, where an actual war was going on, to focus on someplace where a
                    potential war might take place. But we still did take it more seriously than
                    other countries, in part also because of the interest in the U.S. Congress. The
                    Albanian lobby in the U.S. was very effective. Probably only the Israeli and
                    Armenian lobbies were better.</p>
                <p>I do not mean to imply that the Kosovo problem was somehow an artificial one,
                    however. It was a very real problem, and very bad things were happening in
                    Kosovo. The Serb approach was basically a colonial one. The Kosovar Albanians
                    were treated brutally. They saw the U.S. as their major protector and often
                    showed me photographs of the abuse: terrible pictures of people beaten, women
                    raped, and so on. They were very good in documenting all of this and taking
                    their case to the international community. On the other hand, in fairness one
                    must say that many Serbs in Kosovo were also beaten up by Albanians when
                    opportunities presented themselves for this. The gulf and the hatred between
                    Serbs and Albanians were enormous.</p>
                <p>I haven't started talking about the Holbrooke visits yet but one of the things
                    that I tried to do with Holbrooke was to get him more interested in Kosovo. I
                    met a number of times with IbrahimRugova, the Kosovar Albanian leader who was
                    elected President in elections that the Serbs did not recognize. He was a very
                    moderate, reasonable and impressive person who did much to try to avoid an
                    explosion in Kosovo because he knew, rightly, that the Albanians would pay an
                    enormous price for it. He promoted peaceful resistance to Serbia and did so very
                    effectively. Rugova almost never came to Belgrade but he told me that he would
                    be willing to come if he had an opportunity to meet Holbrooke. I tried to
                    interest Holbrooke in this but he turned it down. His position, both in Serbia
                    and later during the Dayton talks, was that one had to resolve Bosnia first,
                    that if the two issues became intertwined they would create a Gordian knot much
                    more difficult to untangle. So he wanted to stay completely away from the Kosovo
                    issues until Bosnia was resolved. He felt if he ever met with Rugova, even once,
                    he would not be able to get away from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he had a point there. They were two quite
                        different issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>PERINA: I think he was right but it was hard explaining this to the Albanians,
                    which became my job both in Belgrade and during the Dayton talks. While we were
                    in Dayton, there was a demonstration outside the base of several hundred
                    Albanian-Americans who came from all over the country to ask that Kosovo be put
                    on the Dayton agenda. It was the only demonstration during the Dayton talks, and
                    I was assigned to go out and meet with the leaders. They were a very peaceful
                    and reasonable group, headed by an Albanian-American physician from Texas. I
                    told them very honestly that Kosovo was not on the table in Dayton because this
                    was a meeting about the war in Bosnia but I assured them that the U.S. had not
                    forgotten Kosovo and would deal with the issue at the right time. They were
                    disappointed, of course, but seemed to accept the argument.</p>
                <p>It was true that we had not forgotten the issue but there was just too much on
                    the Yugoslav agenda at the time. Back in Belgrade, however, I raised Kosovo
                    regularly in my meetings with Milosevic. I tried to convince him that Belgrade's
                    policy would lead to another explosion and violent conflict in the region if it
                    remained unchanged. His standard response was that we were taken in by Kosovar
                    Albanian propaganda, that most Albanians in Kosovo were quite happy, and that
                    only a few troublemakers were fomenting discontent. I am not certain if he
                    really believed this and was so totally misinformed about the situation in
                    Kosovo, or if he just believed that he could keep a lid on the problem
                    indefinitely. I suspect it was a combination of both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was also a nationalistic issue throughout Serb
                        society.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>PERINA: Absolutely. Even the pro-Western, pro-democracy Serbs we knew had very
                    little sympathy for the Kosovar Albanians. There were a few exceptions to this
                    but they were very rare. The gulf even between moderate and reasonable Serbs and
                    Albanians was enormous. To me it was clear that the situation was untenable and
                    would lead to a crisis at some point. What we tried to do in the interim was to
                    urge both sides toward moderation and non-violence. In the case of the
                    Albanians, we had Embassy officers specifically assigned to visit Kosovo on a
                    weekly basis to maintain contact with the Albanians and show them that their
                    plight had not been forgotten by the United States. These officers stayed in
                    local hotels and spent a lot of time going back and forth. After the Holbrooke
                    visits to Belgrade started and Milosevic was trying to demonstrate what a
                    reasonable person he was, I had the idea of asking him whether the Embassy could
                    open a permanent office in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, as a permanent base for
                    our visits. This was actually a big request since everyone knew the sensitivity
                    of Kosovo, and we still lacked formal diplomatic relations for even an Embassy,
                    much less an Embassy branch office. But I persuaded Holbrooke to ask the
                    question, which was one of the few times he agreed to engage on Kosovo.
                    Milosevic was caught off guard and responded in a cavalier way “ Sure. If you
                    want to do this, why not.” I think he regretted this answer the minute he gave
                    it, and the Foreign Ministry certainly regretted it when it came to working out
                    the details. But we did open an office in Pristina, and I think it was one of
                    the more significant accomplishments of my tour. The Kosovar Albanians were so
                    delighted that they actually found a building for us to use free of charge. They
                    saw it as a big step forward in getting international recognition for the entire
                    Kosovo problem. It was also seen as a victory for Rugova and his non-violent
                    policies. It helped defuse the tension, at least for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have people who were brought out of retirement to go to
                        Kosovo. I recently interviewed one of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: During my time, we sent people from the Embassy but alternated them. One
                    of our political officers, Liz Bonkowski, spent a lot of time in Kosovo. The
                    Kosovar Albanians were very anxious to have Western diplomats, particularly
                    American diplomats, in Kosovo because they believed it inhibited the Serbs and
                    offered the Albanians some protection. So having a permanent Embassy office down
                    there was a big step forward. The fact is the situation in Kosovo was extremely
                    tense. I always believed that Kosovo would prove more difficult to resolve than
                    Bosnia. In Bosnia, the Serbs, Muslims and Croats basically spoke the same
                    language, intermarried, and could often not be distinguished except by their
                    last names. And still they slaughtered one another. In Kosovo, the gulf was much
                    wider. The Kosovar Albanians had created their own parallel society that
                    excluded everything Serb. They boycotted Serb schools and set up their own
                    school system so that a whole generation of Albanians already existed that could
                    not speak or even understand Serbian. It was clear that the situation was
                    untenable and a disaster was coming.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Europeans dealing with this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, everyone would wring their hands when Kosovo was mentioned, but the
                    Europeans by and large did not know what to do. One got the impression they were
                    secretly hoping that in fact the Serbs would keep the Albanians in line so that
                    there would not be an explosion. Some Europeans were reminded of ethnic minority
                    problems in their own countries and had a lot of sympathy with the Serbs. The
                    most active European diplomat was the British Charg�, Ivar Roberts. As far as I
                    know, he was the only other diplomat in Belgrade other than myself and the
                    Russian Ambassador who on occasion had meetings with Milosevic. But even he
                    underestimated the Kosovo problem. We were the most engaged Embassy on Kosovo,
                    though even with us it was a secondary issue in comparison to Bosnia.</p>
                <p>The real difference in approach to Kosovo between us and the Europeans was shown
                    after the Dayton Agreement. Here I have to jump ahead a little. Basically,
                    Milosevic made the Dayton Agreement possible. He was the key person who forced
                    the Serb delegation to accept the agreement. Even Holbrooke recognized this.
                    Milosevic did this because he was not a Serb nationalist but rather a
                    self-serving opportunist. He believed that if he helped Dayton succeed, he would
                    be seen in the world as a peacemaker and given legitimacy and respect, the
                    sanctions on Serbia would be lifted, and his role in starting the whole Yugoslav
                    conflict would be forgotten and forgiven. This is what he most wanted and why he
                    helped Dayton succeed. The problem was, however, that we were committed to our
                    promise to the Albanians that we would not forget Kosovo. So after Dayton we did
                    not lift all of the sanctions but rather stated that an outer wall of sanctions
                    would remain until the Kosovo issue was resolved. In effect, the economic
                    sanctions were lifted but the political sanctions, such as non-recognition of
                    Serbia-Montenegro, remained. Milosevic was furious when he learned that some
                    sanctions would remain. He felt that he had been tricked, and it was the
                    beginning of his falling out with Holbrooke.</p>
                <p>But also—and this is where the Europeans come in—most of them did not support the
                    U.S. on the outer wall of sanctions policy. They did not believe that Kosovo
                    should be a reason for further sanctions on Serbia. Most of them started
                    recognizing Serbia-Montenegro and elevating their Charg�s to Ambassadors. By the
                    time I left Belgrade, I was one of the few remaining Charg� d'Affaires. This
                    European rush to normalize relations with Serbia and overlook the Kosovo issue
                    was of course the biggest dread of the Kosovar Albanians. I think it was partly
                    because of this development that the Albanians gave up hope that the
                    international community would help them and moved toward developing the Kosovo
                    Liberation Army, which suddenly appeared on the scene about two years later.
                    This was when I was serving as the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department,
                    and it took the entire international community by surprise. Suddenly, the
                    Kosovar Albanians had an army which they had largely secretly put together. It
                    was an amazing feat but also reflected how bad our intelligence was on Kosovo
                    because we were still focusing almost exclusively on Bosnia. But I think I am
                    getting too far ahead. I am sure we will come back to Kosovo later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, so let's go back to Bosnia pre-Dayton. What was the
                        process of getting to Dayton? How did the talks evolve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, we have to go back to the visits by Bob Frasure, the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary who was handling Yugoslavia and whom I already mentioned.
                    Bob started coming out when it became clear that the policy of just delivering
                    threatening demarches to Milosevic was not working, and when Holbrooke became
                    Assistant Secretary for European Affairs and wanted to get more involved in
                    resolving the conflict. Frasure came out as sort of an advance party to meet
                    with Milosevic and explore if there was any common ground for negotiations that
                    Holbrooke would then take over. He made several visits, and in the end we drew
                    up a broad list of principles by which we thought the conflict could be
                    resolved. The bottom line of these principles was that Bosnia had to remain as a
                    single federalist state, albeit Republika Srpska, a Serb entity with
                    considerable autonomy, could continue to exist within Bosnia. Milosevic agreed
                    to this, and it was the cue for Holbrooke to come in. Milosevic knew this. We
                    had told him that if talks at the Frasure level succeeded, then a higher level
                    representative—understood to be Holbrooke—would come to Belgrade. It was an
                    incentive for Milosevic because he wanted to get the U.S. involved, and he
                    wanted to deal with the highest-level American possible.</p>
                <p>He was also at this time trying to clean up his image in other ways. For example,
                    we had a long-standing child custody dispute with Belgrade. An American mother
                    was trying to get her children back from a Serbian father who had absconded with
                    them to Serbia after he lost custody in U.S. divorce proceedings. For about five
                    years the mother with the Embassy's help had been trying to get the children
                    back, with the Serbs always claiming that they did not know their whereabouts.
                    One day shortly before Dayton, out of the blue, Milosevic called me to say that
                    the children had been found and could be returned to the mother. We immediately
                    picked them up and kept them in the Embassy until the mother arrived, about 24
                    hours later, for a very dramatic and emotional reunion, since they hardly had
                    memory of her. I have no doubt that the Serbs had known for a long time where
                    the children were but Milosevic finally made the decision to return them when he
                    felt it would most bolster his image with the Americans.</p>
                <p>I remember Holbrooke's first visit to Belgrade. He stayed at the Ambassador's
                    residence, where I was by that time living. He came with Bob Frasure and it was
                    the first of about 20 visits by Holbrooke during my time, though I did not keep
                    exact count. At least it seemed like 20, if not more. It was a get-acquainted
                    session but basically he hit it off with Milosevic. Then with each subsequent
                    visit he got more and more involved. He started coming out with the interagency
                    team he put together that included NSC, DOD and JCS reps. The JCS rep was a
                    fellow named Wes Clark, who at the time I think was a one star general. It was
                    this group of about a half dozen people, including Holbrooke, Bob Frasure, Chris
                    Hill, Wes Clark as the JCS rep and an OSD rep, that formed the key negotiating
                    team.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>This group changed shortly thereafter, however, because of the tragic road
                    accident outside Sarajevo in which Bob Frasure, the NSC rep Nelson Drew, and the
                    DOD rep Joseph Kruzel were killed. This happened on August 19, 1995. The whole
                    delegation was traveling from Belgrade to Sarajevo and had been at my house for
                    dinner the night before. Bob Frasure made his last phone call to his wife from
                    our residence. It was an enormous tragedy. My whole family had gotten to know
                    Bob well from his many previous visits when he stayed with us. We were all
                    devastated, including our daughters. I subsequently flew back to Washington for
                    the memorial service and funeral. I remember telephoning Milosevic that Saturday
                    afternoon to tell him about the accident. I left word with his assistant, and
                    Milosevic called back in about two minutes. He did sound genuinely shocked by
                    the news. He had gotten to know Bob well and I think liked him. He later invited
                    Bob's wife and daughters to visit Belgrade and see where Bob had spent his last
                    days. Bob was replaced on the delegation by Chris Hill, who then came on all of
                    Holbrooke's subsequent visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Holbrooke's initial impression of Milosevic and
                        how did the talks proceed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Holbrooke had been briefed on Milosevic by Bob Frasure and me and knew a
                    little of what to expect. I think both Milosevic and Holbrooke found each other
                    interesting as personalities and had an incentive to engage one another.
                    Milosevic saw a deal with the U.S. as the path to lifting sanctions and gaining
                    respectability in the international community, and Holbrooke rightly saw
                    Milosevic as the key person to resolving the Bosnian conflict. Holbrooke was the
                    right person for dealing with Milosevic. For one thing, he could simply outlast
                    Milosevic. These negotiating sessions sometimes went late into the night,
                    sometimes until three o'clock in the morning and start again at six o'clock. I
                    think one session went all night. Holbrooke really had the energy to do this. I
                    think Holbrooke also found Milosevic an interesting person. You could engage
                    with him more easily than with (Bosnian President) Izetbegovic or (Croatian
                    President) Tudjman. For one thing, he spoke English so well. You did not need
                    the formality of interpreters. It makes a big difference in discussions. Of
                    course, that does not mean Holbrooke liked Milosevic. I think we all recognized
                    that this was an unsavory man with a lot of blood on his hands. Perhaps because
                    of this, there was a real challenge in dealing with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much out of Sarajevo and what was
                        happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We saw the cables, and we followed all of the press reports. I knew the
                    Ambassador, John Menzies. But until we were together at Dayton, we did not have
                    much direct interaction. The link between all three capitals—Belgrade, Sarajevo
                    and Zagreb—was Holbrooke and his traveling entourage. And one of the interesting
                    things about Holbrooke, which I am sure frustrated a lot of people in
                    Washington, was that he never reported on his meetings through cables. In the 20
                    or so visits by him to Belgrade, we never did a single reporting cable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was deliberate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Absolutely. He always said— and he was right in this— that the more you
                    report, the more Washington starts interfering in the negotiations. Interagency
                    groups are set up, instructions drafted and circulated, a lot of people who want
                    to get in on the action start appearing, and generally they are not helpful.
                    What Holbrooke did was to call Warren Christopher periodically and brief him
                    orally on the talks. Than, if anyone wanted a telegram, he would just say that
                    he had already briefed the Secretary and that was that. And he got away with
                    this as far as the State Department was concerned. It was a little tougher with
                    the other agencies, particularly the Defense Department, because they did not
                    trust the State Department, either Holbrooke or Christopher. That is why there
                    were so many DOD representatives on the delegation whom Holbrooke had been
                    obliged to accept as part of the initial decision to launch talks. These people
                    were all doing their own reports back to their agencies in Washington. In
                    particular Wes Clark, as the representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would
                    run off after every meeting to send a report back to his people in the Pentagon.
                    Holbrooke knew this, and it irritated him, but there was nothing he could do
                    about it except—later in the process- start having some very private, one-on-one
                    meetings with Milosevic to which the agency reps were not invited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the talks started, was it almost implicit that we had
                        the option of bombing the Bosnian Serbs if the talks did not succeed? Did
                        Milosevic understand this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes. That option was always there, and Milosevic did understand it
                    because in fact before Dayton it happened. We did bomb the Serbs in Bosnia
                    briefly, and there was a huge demonstration, several thousand people, in front
                    of the Embassy. It was one of the few times I was really frightened about things
                    getting out of hand but there was an element of orchestration in the
                    demonstration so that Milosevic did not let it get out of hand. It looked very
                    threatening but remained peaceful. All of this was very ironical because the
                    Embassy had twice been evacuated before the Holbrooke talks when we were
                    threatening the Bosnian Serbs with military action. In each of these cases, all
                    dependents and non-essential personnel were evacuated to Budapest in advance of
                    possible bombing. In each case, the bombing did not happen, and people returned
                    to Belgrade after several days in the Kempinski Hotel in Budapest. After the
                    second time, it became silly, and the Serbs started making fun of it. They
                    photographed the automobile convoy on the way to Budapest and made jokes about
                    it. So then when we finally did take military action shortly before Dayton, the
                    whole Embassy was there and no one had been evacuated. I cannot now remember
                    what finally triggered the bombing but the point was primarily to show the Serbs
                    prior to Dayton that we were serious. Holbrooke wanted to show that there were
                    teeth in the threats after all. But it all happened on short notice and no one
                    had time to evacuate the Embassy when we finally might have needed to do so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time was Croatia brought into the game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Sure. There was another team working with Croatia to try to set up a
                    Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia to balance off the Serbs in the
                    negotiations. I was not directly involved in this but it was seen as one of the
                    elements needed to make the Dayton structure work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this structure worked out with Milosevic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The basic elements agreed with Milosevic were that Bosnia would remain as
                    a single, unified state consisting of two entities, the Serb Republic or
                    Republika Srpska as the Serbs called it, and the Muslim-Croat Federation. The
                    two entities would have a lot of autonomy, including their own parliaments, but
                    there would be a central Bosnian parliament and governmental structure, a
                    central judiciary and so on. There was a rough outline of the division of powers
                    among these entities and the key institutions that would be created but
                    otherwise all the details were worked out at Dayton. That is where we had the
                    real experts, the lawyers and others to put flesh on the bones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Holbrooke get the Bosnian Serbs to agree to
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, Holbrooke rightly did not deal with the Bosnian Serb leaders
                    Karadzic and Mladic. They were simply too tainted by the atrocities committed.
                    That is why he dealt with Milosevic, and why Milosevic was key to the
                    negotiations. One of the fundamental problems through the talks was that we
                    needed to negotiate with the Bosnian Serbs but could not do so directly but only
                    through Milosevic. Milosevic thus knew how important he was to the whole process
                    and hoped to redeem himself and his entire career by helping to make Dayton
                    succeed. There was the one episode that Holbrooke describes in his book when
                    Milosevic persuaded us to have a meeting with Karadzic and Mladic. He organized
                    it at a house on the outskirts of Belgrade. It was the only time that I also met
                    with Karadzic and Mladic because, of course, they were not invited to the Dayton
                    talks. They impressed me as rather sullen and unfriendly. They were, of course,
                    very unhappy with the position they had gotten themselves into. Through their
                    actions in Bosnia, they had become politically radioactive, and thus Milosevic
                    held all the cards in the negotiations, and they as well as Holbrooke were
                    dependent on him as an intermediary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Dayton meeting come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, once the Serbs, basically Milosevic, agreed to the basic principles
                    and structures of a settlement, it was understood that there would have to be a
                    meeting of everyone involved to flesh out the agreement and sign it. You must
                    remember that all of this took place before Milosevic, Izetbegovic and Tudjman
                    had even gotten together in one room. There were actually many key issues still
                    left hanging before we ever got to Dayton. Dayton was not just a paper exercise
                    of filling in the blanks. We knew that there would be high-level talks as well
                    as much detail to work out. Many people had to be brought together. For a while,
                    there was talk of doing this in Europe, but Holbrooke wanted to retain control
                    of it in the United States. Interestingly, Milosevic also wanted the meeting to
                    be in the U.S. I am not sure how in the end the decision was made for Dayton but
                    it made sense to do it on a military base where facilities would be available
                    and access could be controlled. I heard subsequently that Dayton was chosen
                    because it was Strobe Talbott's home town and he suggested it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in Dayton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was Milosevic's keeper at Dayton. Each of the three chiefs of mission
                    came out with their head of state—Peter Galbraith accompanied Tudjman from
                    Zagreb, John Menzies from Sarajevo accompanied Izetbegovic, and I came with
                    Milosevic. The job was to get them to Dayton and be a contact point in dealings
                    with them. I received permission from the Department to fly to Dayton with
                    Milosevic in the private plane that carried the entire Serb delegation. There
                    were some Serbs who came separately from Bosnia, from Sarajevo, but not Mladic
                    or Karadzic who wanted to come but were told they could not. So the Serb
                    delegation from Belgrade was basically Milosevic and Milutinovic and then some
                    military people and intelligence types. For some reason, Milosevic also took
                    this American advisor Chris Spiro to Dayton. During the talks, I participated in
                    most of the meetings involving Milosevic, though not all because there were a
                    few meetings just exclusively between him and Holbrooke. As the talks got more
                    detailed, they broke down into working groups of experts in which Milosevic did
                    not participate. I spent a lot of time trying to keep an eye on Milosevic and
                    the Serb delegation, and there was a lot of down time as is usual in these types
                    of negotiations when people just mingled and chatted in the restaurant or coffee
                    bar.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Milosevic and the other Serbs of course got a little antsy by being restricted to
                    the air force base, Wright-Patterson. They were always coming to us and asking
                    for permission to leave the base and go into town. We let them do so only once
                    when I accompanied them to a shopping mall in Dayton. It was only about a dozen
                    Serbs, but we had to have a lot of security from the U.S. so the entourage was
                    very noticeable. The Serbs walked around looking at the stores and buying
                    things. Some of the lower-level people bought quite a bit of stuff and were
                    excited by all the stores. I remember that Victoria's Secret caused a stir and a
                    lot of jokes. Milosevic, as I recall, bought a pair of shoes in a department
                    store. I am sure he did not need a pair of shoes but he probably wanted to make
                    the point that he had been off the base and allowed to buy what he wanted. These
                    were, after all, people who for years had been under sanctions. There was thus
                    something symbolic for them in getting off the base and buying things—it
                    documented what they saw as the end of sanctions and of being international
                    pariahs. And of course, there were Serb journalists and TV crews there to report
                    on this. This was the only time we let Milosevic off the base. The Serbs wanted
                    to make excursions a number of other times, but we told them that they could not
                    because of security concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was not an idle comment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: True. And we also did not want them wandering all around Dayton. That was
                    the whole point of conducting the talks on a military base. But we did forget
                    about one thing—the PX. We learned that the Serbs had started visiting the PX
                    and buying things there, including U.S. military gear and uniforms in fairly
                    large quantities. We had not thought of this, and the image came of Serb troops
                    outfitted in U.S. gear that the Serbs had procured in Dayton. Holbrooke got
                    really upset, and we had to tell the Serbs that they could not do any more
                    shopping at the PX.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Were the Europeans present at Dayton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The key ally and contact group countries were there but with a very
                    symbolic presence. Most countries had just one person to report on events. These
                    people were largely observers—they were not involved in the negotiations, and
                    generally they were out of the loop. Of course, most people continued to be out
                    of the loop because that was still Holbrooke's negotiating style. On the big
                    issues, he would report to Warren Christopher and through him to the President
                    but try to keep as much of a close hold on information as possible. The
                    Europeans were allowed to be there symbolically because we all knew that in the
                    end we would need the Europeans. NATO would have a post-Dayton role, a vast
                    amount of reconstruction assistance would be required, and so on. But by and
                    large, Dayton was a U.S. show, and really Holbrooke's show. I think Holbrooke
                    deserves a lot of credit for what was accomplished in Dayton. Certainly the
                    agreement did not bring love and everlasting peace to the Balkans, but it did
                    stop the fighting and the bloodshed, and that in and of itself is a very
                    significant accomplishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Now I also think—and I believe Holbrooke would agree with this—that Milosevic did
                    a lot to make Dayton possible. This does not absolve him of his complicity in
                    starting the whole conflict but it is a reality that should be understood.
                    Milosevic operated much like Holbrooke in keeping a lot of information to
                    himself and not sharing it. He cut the final deal in Dayton with Holbrooke,
                    making an agreement possible. Many members of the Serb delegation did not know
                    what was in the agreement until shortly before it was signed. In fact, there was
                    a rumor that I cannot confirm that at least one member of the Serb delegation, a
                    person from Sarajevo, passed out when he saw the final text. There was a lot of
                    unhappiness with parts of the agreement that Milosevic had agreed to but none of
                    the other Serbs could do anything about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What essentially were the parts that made the Serbs
                        unhappy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, there was a lot that made them unhappy, including the basic fact
                    that Republika Srpska would not become independent but remain a part of Bosnia.
                    But this was not a surprise to anyone, and all the Serbs knew this was coming.
                    What really upset them were some of the more detailed provisions on return of
                    refugees, property rights and restitution of property. Basically, the agreement
                    said that all of the Muslims who had been ethnically cleansed could go back to
                    their homes and reclaim their property. This would reverse all of the results of
                    the ethnic cleansing that the Serbs had perpetrated. But then in addition, many
                    of the Serbs were shocked to see how the boundaries were drawn between the Serb
                    and the Federation portions of Bosnia, and also of Sarajevo which was divided
                    into sectors. In effect, some Serbs found that they would be living in
                    Muslim-controlled areas. The person who reportedly passed out was a rather
                    affluent Bosnian Serb who suddenly learned that his entire estate would be in a
                    Muslim rather than Serb part of Sarajevo. As I mentioned before, Milosevic could
                    agree to such terms because he was not really a Serb nationalist. He did not
                    care that much about Serbs. He cared about Milosevic. He thought that by helping
                    to conclude an agreement at Dayton his past actions would be forgotten and he
                    would gain legitimacy and respect. But he was wrong. Kosovo was still
                    outstanding, and it would prove to be his downfall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he still afraid at Dayton that Serbs might be bombed
                        by the U.S.? Was that also a motivation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>PERINA: Perhaps it was. Certainly bombing was never off the table. But this
                    reminds me of another anecdote about the technical support we had at Dayton from
                    the military, which was really impressive. The process of deciding the borders
                    between Republika Srpska and the Federation was one of the hardest parts of the
                    negotiation. It amounted to sitting down and dividing a country on maps,
                    deciding which side gets this village and that road. Numerous disputes came up.
                    In one example, the disposition of a country road depended on whether it was
                    passable in the winter or not, and there was an argument on how wide it actually
                    was. Well, the U.S. had developed a wonderful way to deal with these disputes.
                    We had virtually all of Bosnia on aerial film. There was a room set up at Dayton
                    with several very large TV screens. In the case of this road, for example, we
                    could go to this room, ask the technicians to find the road, and literally fly
                    over it, even changing altitude within a certain range. The delegations that saw
                    this technology were really amazed. One day, Holbrooke found a pretext to take
                    Milosevic into this room and show him how it worked. Milosevic was also amazed.
                    But, of course, the film had not been put together for the purpose of helping
                    the Dayton negotiations. It had been put together by our military for the
                    purpose of possible air strikes within Bosnia. Holbrooke knew this, and he
                    intentionally wanted to remind Milosevic of it. I am confident Milosevic
                    understood and got the message. It was in fact very impressive technology for
                    its time. Nowadays, of course, it might not be any more impressive than Google
                    Earth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself getting sympathetic to the Serbs
                        after all the time you spent with them? You understood their concerns and
                        viewpoints, after all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I found Milosevic very interesting but I would not say I grew more
                    sympathetic to him. On the contrary, as we discussed earlier, the more I knew
                    him the more I recognized how strange he was and what a perverse view of the
                    world he had. With him, the first impression was better than subsequent ones.
                    But I would say that over my entire tour in Belgrade I grew more sympathetic to
                    the Serb people. They had acquired an extremely negative image in the West as
                    almost a nation of rapists and war criminals. This was unfair. I came to know
                    many, many good and courageous Serbs who were as opposed to Milosevic, Mladic
                    and Karadzic as anyone in the West. They were paying the price for having a very
                    bad leadership which allowed the worst elements of society to come to the
                    foreground. I don't think that Serbs are inherently any better or worse than
                    other nationalities in the Balkans. But they have to this day acquired a very
                    negative image in the minds of most people in the West.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: True. But I just don't believe in the concept of collective guilt. I
                    think making everyone guilty lets everyone off the hook. I believe in individual
                    accountability. But the reality is that nations do pay the price for the actions
                    of leaders. I understand how it happens, though it is not fair.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It is difficult for me to say because I really did not interact with them
                    directly. I met them once or twice and observed them at meetings but do not have
                    any deep impression. Certainly their demeanor was very different from
                    Milosevic's. They were much more formal. Dealing with them was very different,
                    if only because of the language barrier.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I never witnessed a shouting match. That was not Holbrooke's style, nor
                    Milosevic's style. Milosevic wanted always to show how unflappable he was. And
                    Holbrooke's real strength was his persistence. He would never give up, even when
                    somebody else might say this is impossible and walk away. It was often just a
                    matter of physical duration and energy. Holbrooke could go on very little sleep
                    at night. I saw this already in his visits to Belgrade. He could go on two hours
                    of sleep at night. Then in the car on the way to the airport he would say “I
                    have to rest for 10 minutes.” He would close his eyes in the car and wake up ten
                    minutes later and be all energetic again. Both Milosevic and Holbrooke were like
                    that. But toward the end of the Dayton talks, Holbrooke did put on this big
                    bluff that he would declare the conference a failure unless all three presidents
                    signed on. We in the U.S. delegation were actually instructed to pack our bags
                    and put them on the sidewalk in preparation for pick-up. He wanted it to really
                    look like he was ending the conference and would declare it a failure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would have been the consequences? Was there an
                        implied consequence like bombing the Bosnian Serbs again if the conference
                        failed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I never heard Holbrooke say directly we're going to bomb if this doesn't
                    work. But as far as the Serbs were concerned, certainly there was an implication
                    that the sanctions would get worse, the isolation would get worse, and we would
                    under no circumstances allow Republika Srpska to secede from Bosnia. In other
                    words, no matter what the Bosnian Serbs did, they would not achieve their main
                    objective of breaking off from Bosnia. We would make sure of that, not through
                    direct military intervention but rather by supporting the Muslim-Croat
                    Federation and changing the military balance within Bosnia if the fighting
                    continued. So logically, the best deal for the Serbs was what they could get in
                    Dayton.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling when the Dayton Accords were
                        signed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>PERINA: They were actually signed twice. There was a signing ceremony at the end
                    of the Dayton Conference in November, and then there was a formal signing
                    ceremony in Paris in December which the French very much wanted. Holbrooke
                    agreed to this because we needed the Europeans to help implement the agreement
                    and also because the Paris ceremony was pretty much deja vu. The really
                    significant event was when the three presidents signed the agreement in Dayton.
                    Many of the Serbs in the delegation, as I mentioned, were devastated. They saw
                    the Agreement as a total sell-out. But for Milosevic, it was a real moment of
                    triumph. Here he had moved from being a sanctioned pariah to being a peacemaker
                    on television screens around the world. Congratulations to the three presidents
                    came from everywhere, including from President Clinton at the White House. I
                    really think Milosevic believed at that moment that he had managed to change his
                    image and shed his pariah status. But we had not forgotten about Kosovo, and
                    Kosovo was yet to be his undoing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to you after Dayton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I returned to Belgrade and shortly before Christmas I got a call from
                    (Deputy Secretary of State) Strobe Talbott asking me to come back to Washington
                    and be Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary in the European Bureau. What happened
                    was that Holbrooke resigned shortly after Dayton to go back to the private
                    sector and he was replaced by John Kornblum, whom I had known for many years and
                    worked for when I was doing CSCE issues. John had been the senior deputy to
                    Holbrooke and now wanted me to be his senior deputy.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Much better with most of the Serbs in Serbia than one would think. They
                    were for the most part relieved that the war was over and that the sanctions
                    might be lifted. I think the Bosnian Serbs were much less happy. The average
                    Serb in Serbia was less supportive of the Bosnian Serbs than many people
                    understand. Sure, there was a sense that Serbs have to support their own against
                    Muslims and Croats. But there was also a real exasperation with the war and a
                    sense that Serbia was paying the price for the likes of Karadzic and Mladic.
                    Most Serbs wanted the war to end and considered Dayton an acceptable and fair
                    conclusion.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>PERINA: Certainly during the period of the sanctions there was an enormous desire
                    among young people to leave the country. There were no opportunities in Serbia.
                    There was not even a functioning economy. But not that many Serbs managed to
                    leave because it was very difficult. Countries clamped down on granting visas,
                    and Serbia was very isolated. There were not even international flights from
                    Belgrade. Getting out was a real challenge, even for non-Serbs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How soon were the sanctions lifted after Dayton?</hi>

                <p>PERINA: The process of lifting sanctions started right away but it took some
                    time. Lifting economic sanctions is actually not an easy task. In the U.S., it
                    takes a Presidential directive to both impose and lift economic sanctions.
                    Political sanctions are easier to work with. But changes in Serbia were
                    noticeable right away. Within a few months, the economy was remarkably
                    normalized. What did not change was what we called the “outer wall of
                    sanctions,” the sanctions we had decided to retain because of the Kosovo issue.
                    These were mainly political sanctions related to recognition of
                    Serbia-Montenegro, exchanging ambassadors and so on. They were largely symbolic,
                    but Milosevic was furious when he realized they would not be lifted. This was
                    the kind of political stigma he thought he had shaken at Dayton. It was the
                    beginning of a real parting of ways between Milosevic and Holbrooke. It also
                    marked a divergence between the U.S. and most of our European allies. The
                    Europeans were not as concerned with Kosovo as we were and did not support the
                    outer wall of sanctions. Most of them rushed to recognition and full
                    normalization of diplomatic ties with Serbia. Unfortunately, this sent just the
                    wrong message to the Kosovar Albanians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Kosovar Albanians react to Dayton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: They were of course disappointed that Dayton had done nothing to address
                    their problems. Suddenly everyone was rejoicing that peace had returned to
                    former Yugoslavia but Kosovo seemed to be forgotten. This was greatly damaging
                    to Rugova's advocacy of non-violent resistance to Serb domination. Some
                    Albanians were saying that precisely the lack of violence in Kosovo made it
                    possible for Europeans to forget the issue. That is why we felt it essential to
                    maintain this outer wall of sanctions. It was a message to Milosevic but also to
                    the Kosovar Albanians that we had not forgotten Kosovo. But it was not enough.
                    It was in this period after Dayton that some of the Kosovar Albanians decided
                    they had to rely more on themselves and started building the Kosovo Liberation
                    Army (KLA), which about a year later took everyone by surprise when suddenly the
                    Albanians had an army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of Albania proper in all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>PERINA: I can't really say definitively but I think it was not large. The
                    Albanian Albanians were having a lot of domestic problems, both political and
                    economic. In many ways, the Kosovar Albanians were wealthier and better off than
                    the Albanian ones. There was also a certain rivalry between Albanian leaders in
                    Albania and Kosovo, almost a love-hate relationship. I think all of this
                    minimized the role that Tirana played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say again, as an old hand in the area, I was
                        surprised in later news footage how good Kosovo looked compared to how I
                        remembered it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There was a legacy of better times in Yugoslavia. It was also my
                    impression that the Kosovar Albanians coped with the international sanctions
                    better than the Serbs. The borders of Kosovo were more porous to allow imports,
                    and the Albanians have a reputation of being more mercantile. Even Serbs would
                    tell me during the sanctions that anything could be obtained at the Kosovo
                    open-air market. I don't know if there is any empirical data, but many people
                    believed that the Kosovar Albanians were better off economically under the
                    sanctions than the Serbs. Politically, of course, it was the reverse. The Serbs
                    were in charge, and any Albanian who raised his head was quickly beaten
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to the States when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: You know how it goes. They wanted me right away in Washington. So my
                    deputy took over in Belgrade, and I returned in February 1996 to become the
                    senior DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary) in the European Bureau. My wife got
                    permission to stay in Belgrade until the summer so that she could finish the
                    school year at the International School of Belgrade where she was teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long were you the DAS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: For about a year and a half. Until the summer of 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you became DAS, had NATO moved troops into
                        Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, we did have forces there to help the implementation. They were
                    international forces, including some NATO forces. Holbrooke thought it important
                    to get the international community in there as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Washington in 1996, did you have the
                        sense that the State Department and the Administration understood the
                        Balkans and were prepared to deal with the region more effectively than in
                        the past?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There were not many successes that the Clinton Administration could point
                    to but I do think that Dayton was one of them. But I sensed that Holbrooke was
                    very worried whether there would be the proper follow-up on Dayton once he left.
                    That is one reason why he wanted me and other people who had worked on Dayton
                    and Yugoslavia to be in charge of the Bureau in Washington. Warren Christopher
                    was the Secretary of State at the time, and he had no particular experience in
                    this part of the world. There were really two primary issues that I dealt with
                    during my 18 months as DAS, apart from the day-to-day matters. The first issue
                    was Dayton implementation, and the second issue was NATO expansion. Those took
                    up about 70 percent of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you took over the Holbrooke role on Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No one could take over the Holbrooke role, and he did not really give it
                    up. Even though he was out of government, he frequently called up John Kornblum
                    or me to find out how things were going and to offer advice. He was clearly
                    worried about the whole settlement coming apart. It was his legacy. And of
                    course there were difficult questions that came up regarding the implementation
                    of Dayton. One of the early debates arose after the indictment of Karadzic and
                    Mladic by the Hague Tribunal. We had indication that they were hiding in
                    Republika Srpska and being assisted by some people within the government. The
                    question was how much of an obstacle this should be in our relations with
                    Republika Srpska, particularly in moving forward with some of the Dayton
                    provisions such as providing reconstruction assistance and so on. Some people in
                    the Administration believed that apprehending Karadzic and Mladic was a top
                    priority and nothing should be provided to Republika Srpska until it extradited
                    them. Other people felt that blocking Dayton implementation was exactly what
                    Karadzic and Mladic would have wanted and that we needed to move forward quickly
                    in building relations with the Bosnian Serbs to develop support for Dayton among
                    the people. I tended to side with the latter. I felt that Karadzic and Mladic
                    were finished, condemned either to the Hague or to hiding out for the rest of
                    their lives, and that making them the centerpiece of our relations with
                    Republika Srpska served only to maintain and enhance their importance. For the
                    most part, my side lost the debate. Strobe Talbott and even Holbrooke feared
                    that Karadzic and Mladic would promote resistance to Dayton if they remained at
                    large in Bosnia. My feeling was that they could not do that to a significant
                    degree if they were forced to remain in hiding, and that we should not let their
                    presence somewhere in a mountain hideout restrict our efforts to win over the
                    Serb people. It was a debate that went on for a long time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we speak today ten years later, they're still in the
                        mountains in Bosnia or Serbia. How are they able to do this, I mean to avoid
                        capture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: How are they able to avoid capture? Well, clearly they do have
                    supporters, though I think fewer and fewer. There are a lot of extreme
                    nationalists among Serbs, but also a lot of very decent people. The Serb nation
                    has been very divided politically since Dayton. The question is how long do you
                    keep on punishing and isolating an entire nation because some criminals,
                    admittedly very bad criminals, have not been brought to justice? Should we have
                    delayed the Marshall Plan after World War II until we captured Eichmann,
                    Mengele, and all the top Nazis? To some degree, we fell into such thinking after
                    Dayton. The outer wall of sections, linked to Kosovo, was fully justified. But
                    the obsession with Karadzic and Mladic was exaggerated and complicated the
                    implementation of Dayton. And the pressure didn't work because, as you say, they
                    are still at large ten years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there elements of anti-Serbism that were pushing this
                        inside or outside the government??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I would not ascribe it to anti-Serbism as such. It was a policy decision.
                    Of course, there was a lot of pressure from the Hague Tribunal because they
                    wanted Karadzic and Mladic badly. But mainly people feared that Karadzic and
                    Mladic would be leaders and rallying points for Serb resistance to Dayton as
                    long as they were free. This exaggerated their importance and underestimated the
                    deeper and more complex roots of Serb nationalism. Somehow we often think that
                    problems can be solved just by getting rid of people at the top. It is a bit
                    like thinking that Iraq would flourish if we could just get rid of Saddam
                    Hussein or that getting rid of Bin Laden will resolve the problem of
                    terrorism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course, the Kosovo issue was still on the
                        table.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Exactly, and that was much more important. The sanctions linked to Kosovo
                    were fully justified and in retrospect perhaps should even have been stronger.
                    But by adding the Mladic and Karadzic conditionality we gave some Serbs the
                    impression that the bar was so high and linked to so many issues that the West
                    just did not want to normalize relations with Serbia. So why even try? But as
                    for Kosovo, it was still relatively quiet in my time. The real crisis came after
                    I left. But we were amazed to suddenly see the Kosovo Liberation Army appear out
                    of nowhere. Our intelligence agencies had totally missed picking this up. A lot
                    of the money came from Albanians in Western Europe, and we were just not focused
                    on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to your position as DAS, how did John
                        Kornblum use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well Kornblum was also involved in Dayton implementation. There was a
                    huge amount to do in that area. He did a lot of the overseas travel and was out
                    of Washington very often. So as the Senior DAS, I ran the entire Bureau when he
                    was gone. I was basically his back-up on almost everything. This was both good
                    and bad. I did everything, but I also did nothing in the sense that there was no
                    specific portfolio for which I alone was responsible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also had this arrangement where Strobe Talbott was
                        running the former Soviet Union. How did that fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That's right. This was the period when the former Soviet Union was not
                    within the European Bureau. It had been broken off and put into the Office of
                    Newly-Independent States (NIS) at the start of the Clinton Administration
                    because it was a region that Strobe Talbott wanted to have for himself. By the
                    time I became DAS, Strobe was the Deputy Secretary and no-longer the head of the
                    NIS office but he still supervised it directly. So it did not fall under the
                    European Bureau, and I never worked on the former Soviet Union in this period.
                    Later, at the start of the Bush Administration, it was put back into the
                    European Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there coordination problems because of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not really. We coordinated on a lateral level with the NIS people, and a
                    lot was coordinated through Strobe Talbott who supervised both the NIS Office
                    and the European Bureau when he was Deputy Secretary. It did cause a bit of a
                    problem with some of the new countries of the former Soviet Union because they
                    felt that the United States was making a political statement and taking them out
                    of Europe, especially since we made an exception for the three Baltic states and
                    kept them within the European Bureau. It was hard to explain why the Baltic
                    states were kept in Europe but Moldova and Ukraine, for example, were not. But
                    the motivation for all of this was simply bureaucratic and not political. No
                    political statement was intended. And Strobe Talbott had a good relationship
                    with Holbrooke. As a matter fact, it was sometimes said that Strobe was
                    Holbrooke's only friend in the State Department. Strobe took a lot of interest
                    in both the Soviet Union and the affairs of the EUR Bureau, and he was seen as a
                    much better person to work with than Madeleine Albright, who was usually off on
                    some travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have worked closely with both Warren Christopher
                        and Madeleine Albright. What was your impression of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>PERINA: I did spend a fair amount of time with Warren Christopher and found him
                    very much a gentleman. He was a careful and meticulous lawyer. His strength was
                    that he knew his own limits in foreign policy and did not hesitate to delegate
                    and take the advice of others. He was not a great innovator or strategic
                    thinker, but rather a reliable caretaker. Madeleine Albright was quite
                    different. She came in with a lot of flair, stressing how she would be
                    non-partisan and active. There was a lot of showmanship with Madeline Albright.
                    She was very good at that. She knew how to deliver good sound bytes and
                    speeches. But in fact she became one of the most partisan secretaries of state I
                    worked with. She was distrustful of the Foreign Service and also not a very deep
                    or strategic thinker. Strobe Talbott was much better and more or less ran the
                    Department during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Let's talk about the enlargement of NATO. How big an issue
                        was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was a big issue, almost as big as Dayton implementation.
                    Unfortunately, it was also an area where I had some doubts about our policy. I
                    felt that the biggest challenge we faced in Europe was to keep Russia on the
                    right path—promoting reform, integrating it into Western institutions, and
                    building a relationship that would not revive Russian nationalism, something
                    very easy to do. We did after all have this remarkable opportunity in that we
                    defeated Russia in the Cold War but not alienated the Russian people, who by and
                    large viewed the U.S. and the West positively. We had all the cards for a really
                    historic partnership with Russia if we could keep it moving forward rather than
                    backward. But NATO expansion did not fit into this. It was unnecessary and only
                    helped to revive Russian paranoia. And it was unnecessary. It did not bring
                    anything of value on the security front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was pushing for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well my sense was always that the motivation was political. NATO
                    membership was obviously favored by the ethnic groups in the United States: the
                    Czechs, the Poles, all of the Central and East Europeans. The votes add up. I
                    can understand that Poles, for example, wanted to be in NATO as an insurance
                    policy against Russia. But it would have been much wiser to take a longer-term
                    view and try to really transform Russia. This was a time for really creative
                    thinking about European security architecture—for trying to devise an
                    arrangement that would give Russia the sense of being included rather than
                    excluded and integrated rather than isolated. This would have had to involve
                    both NATO and the European Union. But once we started down the expansion road
                    with the first tranche of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, it was obvious
                    that it would be very difficult to draw the line and stop. You cannot say these
                    countries get into NATO but the rest of you don't. So the expansion continued to
                    the Baltic states, and now there is even talk of Ukraine, Georgia and so on. It
                    was obvious that Russians—and I mean average Russians, not just the
                    government—would begin to see this as threatening. I just did not see NATO
                    expansion as worth the cost of alienating Russia and losing a really historic
                    opportunity to change its direction.</p>

                        group to join NATO? Weren't there so-called standards that were set up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, there were numerous criteria devised but in the end it was just a
                    political judgment call. I was very much involved in this because I had a good
                    relationship with the Romanian Ambassador, Mircea Geoana. The Romanians really
                    wanted to be in that first tranche of new members and lobbied extremely hard for
                    it. It was Geoana's major objective in Washington. To me it was pretty clear
                    that Romania was not politically ready to be a NATO member. Democratic reforms
                    were shaky, and the country had problems with neighbors like Moldova. But people
                    were leading the Romanians on in order to motivate them to undertake reforms,
                    and the Romanians started believing that they had cleared the hurdle. The
                    Europeans were just telling Bucharest what it wanted to hear because they
                    assumed the U.S. would block the membership. Well, in the end that is exactly
                    what happened. It came down to the U.S. and we predictably decided it was too
                    early for Romania's membership. I was tasked with breaking the news to Geoana
                    informally the day before Strobe Talbott did it formally. It was a real shock to
                    him. He was devastated and thought his diplomatic career was over. In fact it
                    wasn't, and he later became Foreign Minister of Romania.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: And Romania got into NATO in the second tranche. By then it was less of
                    an issue. The real irony was that once most of these countries got into NATO, it
                    was no big deal because their real objective was to get into the European
                    Union.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It had a certain symbolic significance but that was it. And the symbolism
                    was exactly the wrong kind to the Russians and damaged our relationship with
                    them. That is why I believed that it was not worth the cost, even though this
                    was very much a minority view. Remember also, the European Bureau was not in
                    charge of Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was fear of Russian revanchism among the East
                        Europeans. NATO membership made them feel safer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, but I fear that the way we handled the threat of revanchism made it
                    a self-fulfilling prophecy. Russia was so weakened in 1995 that it was hardly a
                    threat to anyone. On the contrary, it was a basket case. The standard of living
                    had declined even from Soviet times. The Russian people had made enormous
                    sacrifices to get rid of Communism and were really hoping for help and
                    partnership with the West. The NATO expansion made them think that the reverse
                    was happening—that their weakness was being exploited. And Russian nationalists
                    and demagogues came forward to take advantage of this perception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the European Union? Were we seeing the
                        European Union as a good thing or potentially as a rival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: At that time our status was pretty high in the European Union and in
                    Western Europe. We had won the Cold War in a way that no one had imagined a
                    decade earlier, and we were the only super power on earth. For the most part,
                    the Europeans looked to us for leadership. France, however, was always the most
                    difficult. It had always been worried about America's dominance of Europe, and
                    this certainly did not diminish after we won the Cold War. It was in this period
                    that the French really started pushing for a separate European military identity
                    and a more coordinated foreign policy within the European Union. We always said
                    for the record that we did not oppose this but we very much wanted it to stay
                    within agreed limits. We certainly did not want the European Union to become a
                    rival to NATO. We had some early discussions on this with the Europeans during
                    my time as DAS. There was a lot of thinking within the U.S. Government about
                    what rules should be applicable in the relationship between NATO and the EU. The
                    evolving view was that NATO should have first choice on deciding whether it
                    would deal with an issue or whether it would fall to the EU. It became more
                    complex when we got to matters like military troops and equipment that were
                    designated as both NATO and national assets. Thanks to the British and Germans,
                    for the most part the EU accepted the guidelines that the U.S. proposed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Germany? Was there any concern about a reunified
                        Germany? Wasn't this worrying its neighbors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I don't think we or the Europeans were worried about a resurgent Germany.
                    To us German democracy seemed pretty solid. We had traditionally wanted Germany
                    to play a stronger role in Europe as a counterbalance to France. So a unified
                    Germany was not a concern. It was one of the real achievements of James Baker as
                    Secretary of State and showed, in my view, how basically cooperative the
                    Russians were in working with us at that time. What did concern me about Germany
                    when I became DAS was something else. It was all the reports about how difficult
                    it was for West Germany to integrate the East, how hard it was for the two
                    halves to come together. And this, of course, was under the ideal circumstances
                    of a very affluent West Germany investing an immense amount in reunification.
                    You know they converted East Marks into West Marks at a one-to-one rate. What a
                    great deal for the East Germans. But the fact that there were still all these
                    difficulties and tensions made me wonder how difficult it was going to be to
                    integrate the rest of Eastern and Central Europe into the global economy. This
                    was, after all, something with which no one had experience, something never done
                    before. But I am glad to say that, in retrospect, I think this actually went
                    better than I expected at the time. I would not have guessed that ten years
                    later so many of these new democracies would be in the European Union. I thought
                    it would take much longer but I am glad I was wrong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q What other issues did you work on? Did you do a lot of
                        travel as DAS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I did a modest amount of travel, primarily because Kornblum was always on
                    the road, and I had to hold the fort down in Washington. But I did make some
                    visits to Sarajevo and saw it for the first time since the end of the fighting.
                    The devastation was truly shocking. Miles and miles of just rubble. It showed
                    that this had not been just a regional conflict but really a total war. On the
                    other hand, I also visited the three Baltic republics for the first time ever
                    and was surprised at how good they looked despite half a century in the Soviet
                    Union. On another trip I visited Albania, which was going through a very
                    difficult period. I met with President Berisha and drove through the country
                    from Montenegro to Macedonia. It did impress me as poorer than Kosovo and was
                    politically very unstable. There was a lot of opposition to Berisha,
                    demonstrations, scandals and so on. It generated a lot of work for us.
                    Otherwise, I traveled to Western Europe for contact group meetings and other
                    events. Once I actually flew overnight to London and then back to Washington on
                    the same day. I would not recommend it and never did it again. It was hard to
                    get away from Washington. As the Senior DAS, I had a flow of day-to-day issues
                    and meetings that never ceased. It was really one of my least favorite jobs. I
                    always preferred working overseas to working in the Washington bureaucracy.</p>

                <p>PERINA: I wanted to go somewhere in the former Soviet Union. I was tired of the
                    Balkans and realistically not going to get an ambassadorship in Western Europe.
                    Moldova was what I was offered. It was one of the republics I had never visited
                    in the Soviet Union, and I did not know much about it. But it turned out to be a
                    very pleasant surprise for us. It was a much more pleasant place than we had
                    imagined. The people were extremely friendly and hospitable, and the country was
                    very interesting to work in. It had all the economic and political problems
                    endemic to other parts of the former Soviet Union plus an unresolved conflict
                    over the secessionist region of Transnistria. Working on this conflict in fact
                    then lead to my subsequent assignment as the Special Negotiator for Eurasian
                    conflicts.</p>

                        up to the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There is no such thing as brief history in this part of the world, as I
                    am sure you know. Moldova's history is interesting because it has always been a
                    border region between different empires. Even in ancient times it was right on
                    the border of where the Roman Empire ended. In modern times it was on the border
                    between the Ottoman and Russian empires and then between Romania and the Soviet
                    Union. It was always going back and forth between big neighbors. The ethnic mix
                    reflects this. It is a classic multiethnic state that is roughly 60% Romanian
                    speaking and 40% Slavic speaking, primarily Ukrainian and Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember reading about Bessarabia, which is how people
                        used to refer to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Right. That was a name often used up until World War II. It used to have
                    an even greater ethnic mix. It had a large Jewish population in the nineteenth
                    century. Some cities were over 50% Jewish. A good part of this population
                    emigrated, often going to the United States, early in the twentieth century.
                    Many of those that remained were killed by the fascist regime during World War
                    II. The Jewish population is making a gradual comeback, and there are now about
                    50,000 Jews in Moldova in an active, well-organized community. The country also
                    has a sizeable Bulgarian minority and an ethnic group called the Gagauz, who are
                    basically Turks who settled there over the centuries and converted to
                    Christianity. So you see it is a considerable ethnic mix, and it cannot be
                    geographically divided. It is a leopard skin, as some people there said, of
                    ethnic groups dispersed throughout the country. Basically, Moldova is one of
                    those multiethnic states that exists because it has to, because the population
                    cannot be integrated into any neighboring state without a significant
                    conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The ethnic tensions in fact erupted with the break-up of the Soviet Union. Some
                    of the Romanian speakers started calling for unification with Romania, which
                    sparked resistance among the Slavic speakers. A conflict erupted, and in 1990
                    the region called Transnistria, a long narrow strip east of the Dniester River
                    which has a slight majority of Slavic speakers, declared independence from
                    Moldova. The Soviet 14th Army helped the Transnistrians in a war that continued
                    until 1992 when a ceasefire was declared. But the conflict remains unresolved to
                    this day, with the country divided. So Transnistria is a secessionist region,
                    unrecognized by any country in the world but not under the control of the
                    Moldovan government. However, Transnistria is being de facto supported by Moscow
                    because without Russian assistance it could not survive for very long. Russia is
                    keeping the secession alive.</p>

                        How does that fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Ukraine is very much involved in the mediation effort and is a key
                    country that can help resolve the conflict because it can clamp down on
                    Transnistria's borders. Recently, it has started doing that more seriously.
                    Ukraine is in fact one of the three official mediators that were agreed upon in
                    the 1990's to find a solution to the conflict. These three are Russia, Ukraine
                    and the OSCE. The OSCE representative has in recent years been an American, so
                    we have a role as well. The problem is that Russia and Ukraine both are not
                    impartial to the conflict. Many of the Slavic speakers in Transnistria, for
                    example, are ethnic Ukrainians. There are more of them than of the Russians. So
                    Kiev says it politically cannot impose very stringent sanctions because it would
                    be punishing its own ethnic brethren. The Russians use a similar line. For the
                    Russians, Transnistria provides sort of an outpost of influence in the region.
                    True, Russia and Transnistria are not contiguous, but there are many economic
                    and political links nonetheless. It is also a symbolic issue for Russian
                    nationalists. Zhirinovsky visited Transnistria several times to show his
                    allegiance to the Russian population.</p>

                    fell under Russian control during the time of Katherine the Great and has thus
                    been part of Russia or the Soviet Union for over two centuries, with the
                    exception of the twenty-year period between World War I and World War II when it
                    was part of Romania. So it is an ancient and disputed territory—a little like
                    Macedonia in the Balkans which is an independent country but also has historic
                    links to the Macedonian region of Greece. There were Romanian nationalists on
                    both sides of the Moldovan-Romanian border calling for unification with Romania.
                    But in my time and in recent years only about 10% of the population favors
                    unification with Romania, and all the Slavic speakers oppose it so it would just
                    lead to another war. Now a further complication is that Transnistria was really
                    not a part of Bessarabia historically but rather a part of Ukraine. It was part
                    of the border changes that Stalin implemented to make escape of ethnic republics
                    from the Soviet Union less likely. He took the southern tip of Bessarabia and
                    gave it to Ukraine, and he took Transnistria from Ukraine and gave it to Moldova
                    to create a kind of interlocking jigsaw puzzle. He did this in the Caucasus as
                    well, and it accounted for many of the regional conflicts when the Soviet Union
                    broke up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem getting the appointment to be
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. The hearings were straightforward and everything went well. The
                    clearance process is of course long but it gave me time to study Romanian and
                    brush up my Russian so that was not a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been Ambassador before you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: A fellow named Todd Stewart who was an economics officer. He was the
                    second Ambassador and I was the third.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about what American interests were when you
                        went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well the American interests were to preserve and promote stability in
                    this part of Europe. We saw how the Yugoslav conflict had destabilized the
                    Balkan region, and we did not want another conflict destabilizing the Eastern
                    Balkans, particularly a conflict that could draw in Russia and Romania. So our
                    interest was to try to resolve the Transnistrian conflict and to help Moldova
                    develop into an economically and politically successful country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government of Moldova like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>PERINA: There were some big changes in the government while I was there. When I
                    arrived there was essentially a center left government under President Petru
                    Lucinschi. He had been a Communist Party functionary in the Soviet Union but
                    after the Soviet break-up renounced Communist ideology and moved toward the
                    center, although he really had interests on all sides and very cleverly played
                    the entire political spectrum. There were many such leaders with leftist
                    pedigrees but re-born views in the new republics that emerged from the Soviet
                    Union. But about halfway through my tour, there was an election and the
                    unconverted Communist Party candidate won. It drew a lot of attention because
                    Moldova was billed by the media as the first country emerging from the Soviet
                    Union which elected a Communist president. This seemed to forget about
                    Lukashenko in Belarus, but I guess he wasn't considered freely-elected. In any
                    case, this was Vladimir Voronin who was the head of the unreformed Communist
                    Party in Moldova, although he turned out to be a far more complex and difficult
                    to categorize President than most of us expected. He and the Communist Party
                    were quite left-wing in rhetoric and ideology prior to gaining power but then
                    began changing to a more pragmatic course. Indeed, Voronin eventually broke with
                    the Russians over Transnistria and has become one of the more pro-Western
                    leaders in the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The main reason the Communists got elected was because the center and
                    center-right parties were incapable of working together. The leaders of these
                    parties were just not used to making alliances and compromising in order to
                    cooperate with one another. Everyone wanted to be the king. This is in fact a
                    problem of democratic parties in many of the post-Soviet states. So the
                    Communists remained the single largest party and best organized party. The
                    majority of the country would have preferred a more centrist government but the
                    center right parties could not agree on a slate or single candidate so their
                    votes were split up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the land still collectivized from Communist days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It was one of the earliest countries where a land privatization program
                    was initiated. This was the major USAID program in Moldova and considered quite
                    successful. It was started under my predecessor, Todd Stewart, and concluded
                    during the time I was there. Basically, all the collectivized farms were divided
                    up among members of the collectives. The idea was that this would motivate
                    efficiency and productivity because people would have a vested interest in their
                    little plot as opposed to the large collective farms that were generally
                    collapsing. Some people did criticize the privatization with the argument that
                    inefficiency was created by going from large to small economies of scale.
                    Subsequently we found the truth was somewhere in between. There is a loss of
                    efficiency with small plots but the argument was academic because the large
                    farms were dysfunctional. No one had loyalty to them, people stole from them,
                    machinery was not taken care of and so on. Our idea was that the new owners
                    would in fact work together in voluntary associations but preserve the vested
                    interest that comes from ownership.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our assistance programs help the economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think so. We had a lot of assistance programs. We were in fact the
                    single largest donor of humanitarian and technical assistance, and in my time we
                    gave more than all other donors combined. We gave about $50 million a year in
                    assistance, which is a significant amount for a country of a little over four
                    million people. Moldova had on a per capita basis the third highest level of
                    U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union. Armenia and Georgia were the two
                    higher recipients, and their assistance levels were largely earmarked by
                    Congress for political reasons. Moldova earned the assistance because it
                    cooperated on programs and was making real reform efforts. There was a certain
                    concern if this would continue after the Communists came in because they had
                    been critical of the land privatization program and initially made moves against
                    it. But then they backed off and recognized that reforms were needed,
                    particularly if they wanted continued assistance from the West. One of the good
                    things in recent years has been that the EU has taken greater interest in
                    Moldova and now is perhaps giving more than the United States. With Romanian
                    entry into the EU, Moldova became a neighboring country to the EU and thus they
                    have taken greater interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the OSCE, the Organization of Security and
                        Cooperation in Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The OSCE has a large mission and is very active, especially since it is
                    one of the three mediators of the Transnistrian conflict. It also does all the
                    other things that OSCE missions do: monitor human rights conditions, monitor and
                    observe elections, and so on. The last three heads of the OSCE mission have been
                    Americans, primarily because that is what the Moldovan government wants. They
                    want someone to balance off the Russians in the Transnistria negotiations and
                    think that only the Americans can really stand up to Moscow. I think on this
                    point they are right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were Americans well accepted there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>PERINA: We were very well accepted. The people were extremely friendly. We had a
                    large Peace Corps presence, over a hundred volunteers, and whenever I met with
                    some they told me how much they liked the country and how hospitable the people
                    were. I was very proud of our Peace Corps volunteers. They lived under some
                    terribly difficult conditions in small towns throughout the country and yet they
                    were so upbeat and dedicated. It was very inspiring to see this American
                    commitment and idealism. I had not worked in a country previously that had a
                    Peace Corps program, and I was very impressed with it. The other great thing we
                    did was in the area of exchange programs. We had the funding to send several
                    hundred Moldovans a year to the United States, mostly on shorter visits of three
                    to four weeks under the International Visitor Program. I am a great believer in
                    exchange programs. Many of our participants had never been to the West, and had
                    never imagined they would visit the United States. For so many of the Moldovans
                    who participated, it seemed to be a life-changing event. I had one idea to send
                    a group of local museum directors to the United States to see how museums are
                    run. They came back astounded. It was very gratifying to be able to do this for
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you send Moldovans to the United States, the world
                        opens up, and it is hard to go home. How did you handle that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: True, this is often a problem, particularly with students and younger
                    people. They see the limited opportunities for themselves in Moldova, and it is
                    difficult to go back. But it was less of a problem for the older, professional
                    people we sent. They had families in Moldova, established homes, and usually a
                    much weaker command of English than the young people. For the most part, they
                    did not want to start over in another country. Most of the Moldovans trying to
                    go abroad were either young students or unskilled workers who went to Russia and
                    Western Europe to earn money that they could send home. This was a serious
                    problem. Some rural villages were almost empty of working-age men. Children were
                    growing up without their fathers in the household. On the other hand, it did
                    bring money and hard currency into the country and helped a lot of families
                    survive difficult times.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The economy was in bad straits, and still is. The per capita income in my time
                    was between $50 and $100 per month. It was very hard to measure and in fact may
                    have been higher because there was such an enormous black or underground economy
                    by people who did not declare their income in order to avoid taxes. This then
                    meant the government did not have money for pensions, schools and social
                    programs. Pensioners were particularly hard hit. You know, Moldova was the
                    republic with the most moderate climate in the Soviet Union. As a result of
                    this, many pensioners went there to retire, especially military pensioners who
                    had weak ties to any other place. In this respect, it was a bit like the Florida
                    of the Soviet Union. Well, when the Soviet Union fell apart, suddenly the new
                    Moldovan government had responsibility for all of these pensioners who had
                    previously gotten their pensions from Moscow. Imagine if Florida suddenly became
                    responsible for all the social security payments there. It was one of the many
                    problems Moldova faced and one of the many complications from the dissolution of
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Embassy involved in dealing with the
                        Transnistrian issue? Was Transnistria just a separate world or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We did quite a bit. I did not participate in the mediation negotiations
                    since the U.S. was not one of the three mediators. That was done by the American
                    who headed the OSCE Mission. But we in the Embassy were active in other ways. I
                    had a lot of discussions with the two presidents, Lucinschi and Voronin, on
                    policy toward Transnistria. I also tried to be more active within Transnistria.
                    In particular, I initiated a dialogue with the Transnistrian so-called
                    President, Igor Smirnov. We had not engaged with the Transnistrians on that
                    level before except through the OSCE Mission, and Washington agreed it was worth
                    making the effort from a bilateral standpoint. Smirnov was, of course, a thug
                    but I had experience in dealing with those from Belgrade. He was not even a
                    Moldovan. He had come to Transnistria from Russia after the Soviet break-up and
                    led the secession effort, and afterward he turned the territory into a big
                    money-making machine. You have to understand that, while the war had its origins
                    in some real ethnic tension that arose when the Soviet Union broke up, by 1998
                    the ethnic component of the conflict was kept alive artificially. Relations
                    between Romanian and Slavic speakers were much improved. There was no real
                    threat of unification between Moldova and Romania. Transnistria still existed
                    because it was turned into an economic fiefdom for Smirnov, his family and his
                    cronies. I used to call it Europe's biggest duty free shop. It was basically a
                    big staging area for smuggling operations. Enormous amounts of money were made
                    by smuggling goods into Ukraine and Moldova proper through Transnistria to avoid
                    taxes and customs duties. Many people in both Moldova and Ukraine were complicit
                    in this and made money from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>PERINA: The basic scenario was something like this. A shipment of goods would
                    come into the port of Odessa marked as destined for Transnistria. The Ukrainians
                    would allow it to pass duty free to Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria. Then
                    it would be smuggled across the border back into Ukraine or into Moldova without
                    payment of any duties. This was relatively easy to do. Moldova had no
                    checkpoints because it did not want to imply that Transnistria was a separate
                    country. As for Ukraine, there were many entry points along the lengthy border.
                    People on the Ukrainian side who were in on the scheme also paid off customs
                    officials, and so on. With high duty items like cigarettes and liquor, the
                    profits were enormous but many commodities besides these were also smuggled. I
                    heard estimates of hundreds of millions of dollars generated through such a
                    scheme. Clearly many people in Moldova and Ukraine were involved and had a
                    vested interest in keeping this going, including very high-ranking people in the
                    Ukrainian government. That is a major reason why it was so difficult to get
                    Ukraine to put pressure on Transnistria.</p>
                <p>But getting back to Smirnov, when I arrived and Lucinschi was president of
                    Moldova, the conflict had become fairly benign. There were still formal talks to
                    resolve it but the tensions were low. In fact, Smirnov sometimes actually
                    visited Chisinau from Transnistria. I first met him at a Russian Embassy
                    reception that he was attending. The relationship between Transnistria and
                    Moldova became much tenser after Voronin became President. In any case, Smirnov
                    was hardly isolated, and we saw no benefit in avoiding talking to him. I
                    received the Department's concurrence to have some meetings and try to persuade
                    him to find a resolution to the conflict. This had to be done carefully because
                    Smirnov was of course looking for ways to make any contact with Westerners look
                    like recognition of an independent Transnistria. During my first visit to
                    Tiraspol, the Transnistrians wanted to have television cameras, a formal lunch
                    and so on. I refused all this and said I would only come for a meeting and no
                    protocol functions. The Transnistrians agreed because they wanted a dialogue.
                    Altogether I met with Smirnov about half a dozen times during my tour. They were
                    frustrating talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, he felt under no real pressure to change a profitable arrangement.
                    His only interest was in keeping it going. It was clear that the ethnic issue
                    was no longer a concern even for him, although he still used it publicly as a
                    pretext for secession. The real issues were all economic. He wanted to retain
                    Transnistria as a money making operation. Unlike in other secessions, say Kosovo
                    or Abkhazia, the Transnistrians did not insist on being recognized as an
                    independent country, having a UN seat and so on. Their so-called foreign
                    Minister Valeri Litskai once told me that they would be happy to be like Taiwan:
                    not recognized as a separate country but free to have all their own economic
                    relations. “Just let us do our business,” he would argue. The problem is we
                    could not allow that because it was hurting all of Moldova badly. Tax revenue
                    was lost by the Moldovan government. Foreign investors were afraid to go into a
                    country with an unresolved conflict. It was draining resources that were needed
                    for development. We wanted Moldova to be stable and successful, and Transnistria
                    was clearly an obstacle to that. An additional problem was that a lot of
                    Moldova's industry was located in Transnistria. This had been done since the
                    days of Stalin so that the industrial base would not be directly on the
                    frontline. But it was industry that Moldova as a whole needed badly for its
                    economy. It was unfair for just the Transnistrians to exploit it. There was, for
                    example, a steel plant which was one of the largest and best in the former
                    Soviet Union. When I was preparing for my confirmation hearings, I looked at the
                    trade figures and I saw that the U.S. had a trade deficit with Moldova. I could
                    not believe this. I asked the desk to look into this, and it turned out that we
                    were one of the importers of rolled steel from Transnistria. These are the steel
                    rods that are most often put into construction concrete, and importing them was
                    not illegal because there were no U.S. sanctions in place against Transnistria.
                    On the contrary, the U.S. was purchasing so much Transnistrian steel that on
                    paper we had a trade deficit with Moldova.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Russian troops in Transnistria fit into all
                        this? Were they selling their tanks in the background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There were two categories of Russian troops, with the distinction between
                    them often deliberately blurred by the Russians. One category was several
                    hundred Russian peacekeepers who were there ostensibly to maintain a ceasefire.
                    The Moldovans had agreed to these but regretted the agreement almost before the
                    ink was dry. The second category was several thousand troops who were remnants
                    of the Soviet 14th Army that had been stationed in Moldova during the Cold War.
                    They were ostensibly there to guard the military weapons and stockpiles left
                    over from the 14th Army and not yet withdrawn. This included over 40,000 tons of
                    ageing ammunition stored at a military base in Transnistria called Cobasna. The
                    Moldovans wanted the stockpiles plus the Russian troops out of Moldova but the
                    Russians claimed that Smirnov would not let them withdraw the weapons and
                    ammunition and they could not let this materiel fall into his hands by leaving.
                    There was a lot of theater in this because the Russians in fact had means to put
                    pressure on Transnistria if they really wanted Smirnov to let them leave. But
                    Smirnov did claim that all of this materiel belonged to Transnistria, just as
                    other Soviet assets fell to the republics where the assets were located when the
                    Soviet Union dissolved.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were doing a lot to help the Russians dismantle weapons
                        in many parts of the former Soviet Union. Were we doing anything of that
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, we were. The background to this is that at the 1998 OSCE Summit
                    meeting in Istanbul where there was agreement on an adapted CFE treaty, we
                    prevailed on Yeltsin to make public commitments that Russia would withdraw all
                    its remaining troops from Moldova and Georgia, where there was a similar
                    problem. These became known as the Istanbul commitments and were quite
                    controversial later because Moscow tried to weasel out of them and we refused to
                    ratify the adapted CFE treaty until they were fulfilled. In any case, we wanted
                    to help the Russians withdraw or destroy these armaments because they were
                    destabilizing, and destroying weapons is in fact very expensive if done safely.
                    The experts who came told me that it costs far more today to destroy a Soviet
                    tank then it cost to build it. So the OSCE created this voluntary fund to help
                    with the arms withdrawal, and the U.S. was the major contributor to the fund. We
                    made several million dollars available for this, and the fund was administered
                    by the OSCE Mission in Chisinau. Well, to make a long story short, there was
                    some limited destruction of tanks and one or two trainloads of weapons and
                    ammunition were withdrawn but then the withdrawals stopped, and the Russians and
                    the armaments are in Moldova to this day. It became pretty clear to me that the
                    Russians did not really want to withdraw all this materiel because it provided a
                    pretext for them to stay militarily in Moldova, even if with just a token
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these weapons being sold? Were they being shipped off
                        to someplace like Syria or Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: There were many rumors to this effect but I never saw any evidence of
                    sales. The fact is that most of the armaments were not worth much and were
                    dangerous. Smirnov, of course, argued that they were very valuable. He once told
                    me that he would sell them all to the U.S. for four billion dollars. This is
                    probably more than all of Transnistria was worth. We once had reports that the
                    Transnistrians tried to sell some of these stockpiles, as did the Russians, but
                    no one was interested. The materiel was all old, unstable and dangerous. I think
                    the Russians thus concluded that its greatest value came from providing a
                    pretext for an indefinite Russian presence in Moldova.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Russian troops doing? Were they isolated on
                        bases or visible on the streets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Occasionally you would see some on the streets of Tiraspol but for the
                    most part they were on the bases, which were ostensibly still under Russian
                    control. Some of the Russian troops had been there for so long that they had
                    basically gone native. They married spouses in Transnistria, acquired families
                    and were pretty well settled in. They also did not want to leave for some new
                    posting in Siberia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, it strikes me that all of this was sort of a
                        wasting asset for Smirnov. Time was not on his side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That is exactly what I tried to convince him of in our meetings. But he
                    and his cronies were making a lot of money, and they wanted to keep the business
                    going as long as they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working with our Embassies in Moscow, Kiev and
                        Bucharest? Was this a joint effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: We coordinated closely. Those three embassies were the key ones as well
                    as our OSCE Mission in Vienna, given all the OSCE involvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about the conflict, were people still
                        getting killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. By the time I was there it was not a hot conflict like Nagorno
                    Karabakh or the other ones in the Caucasus. There was tension, especially after
                    Voronin came in because he and Smirnov really got to hate one another, but no
                    one was being killed. Occasionally there were confrontations between police
                    forces on the boundary line or something like that but both sides usually backed
                    away from real violence. It had become largely an economic conflict, and not
                    even an ethnic one. By the time I arrived, Moldova actually had very good ethnic
                    relations between Romanian and Slavic speakers. Both Russian and Romanian were
                    accepted in public. A politician would speak in Russian on the seven o'clock
                    evening news and then in Romanian on the eight o'clock news. A politician would
                    be finished if he spoke Russian on television in Estonia, for example. This good
                    relationship between the ethnic groups in Moldova was why most people believed
                    that the Transnistrian conflict should be the easiest of all the conflicts in
                    the former Soviet Union to resolve. In theory it should be. But as Yogi Berra
                    said: In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice but in
                    practice there is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How active could the Embassy be in the Transnistrian
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>PERINA: We did things that were possible to do without going through the local
                    authorities. We did not want to do that anything that would imply official
                    recognition of Transnistrian authorities as an independent state. My going to
                    see Smirnov was OK because we viewed him as a provincial leader in a country to
                    which I was accredited. I never called him President, and we made our point that
                    he fell under the US Embassy in Moldova. But we would not deal with Tiraspol as
                    though it was a sovereign government. Thus we could do things like exchanges and
                    certain assistance programs that did not need to go through the government,
                    things we could carry out directly with the people concerned. We did not give
                    any technical or humanitarian assistance that had to go through the
                    Transnistrian government. Transnistria did get much less U.S. assistance than
                    Moldova proper because of this restriction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did economic conditions compare between Transnistria
                        and Moldova? Was the situation in one better than in the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: This was an issue of much debate between the two sides, and it is
                    difficult to judge because the statistics are so unreliable. I think that people
                    in Transnistria were worse off because of the isolation and the control and
                    exploitation of the economy by Smirnov and his people. The Transnistrian
                    currency, the ruble, was a joke and had no value outside of Transnistria. At
                    least the Moldovan leu was convertible within Moldova and relatively stable. But
                    the hard fact is that the economic situation was bad on both sides of the
                    Dniester. That is why human trafficking, for example, became such a problem in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Moldova became one of the main source countries in the region for young
                    women who were sent overseas for prostitution. It was a terrible problem. In
                    some cases, the girls knew what they were getting into and chose to do so just
                    to escape the poverty in Moldova and get to the West. In many cases in my time,
                    however, the victims did not know they would be forced into prostitution and
                    thought they would be working as nannies, waitresses, or something like that.
                    Most often, it was women and girls from the countryside who were tricked in this
                    fashion. Moldova became notorious as a source country for such trafficking. Most
                    often the victims were sent to Western Europe or the Balkans and the Middle East
                    but one NGO even found two Moldovan girls in a brothel in Cambodia. Fortunately,
                    the matter got so much publicity that a lot of international donors started
                    giving money to deal with the problem. Also, trafficking was not unique to
                    Moldova. It was a big problem in Ukraine, Russia, the entire region. By the time
                    I was leaving, there were many NGO's and programs dedicated to fighting human
                    trafficking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could the Embassy do about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>PERINA: We directed a good chunk of our assistance money to supporting such
                    programs. Primarily these were educational programs to warn young women of what
                    could happen to them. The Embassy financed production of a documentary film that
                    gave testimony from real victims of trafficking. It was shown in schools and on
                    Moldovan television. There were even billboards in Chisinau warning against the
                    dangers of being recruited. So we did a lot, and I think the problem diminished
                    but of course the roots of the problem were economic, and the only long-term
                    solution was to raise the standard of living.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Moldova lobbying for NATO and European Union
                        membership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not for NATO membership. Moldova's constitution stated that the country
                    would be neutral, and lobbying for NATO membership would have complicated any
                    reconciliation with Transnistria. Moldova was a member of the Partnership for
                    Peace program and cooperated with NATO in that respect. There were even several
                    NATO-related training exercises in Moldova with international participation. The
                    Embassy also had a very active military assistance and training program run by
                    the Defense Department. We had very good relations with the Moldovan
                    military.</p>
                <p>As for the European Union, most Moldovans are very Western-oriented and would
                    have loved to become members. I think they hope to do so someday. In my time,
                    they recognized that it was unrealistic to expect membership but they did want
                    closer relations and economic ties with the EU. Unfortunately, the European
                    Union was not very active in Moldova at the time. They have become much more
                    active in recent years after Moldova became a neighboring country to the EU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Moldova in 2001. Is there anything else we should
                        talk about from this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, I left in 2001. There are two things I would mention briefly. The
                    first was the Y2K episode. Remember that? It was the technical crash that all
                    the experts said would occur when computers tried to switch from 1999 to 2000. I
                    still don't understand why this was supposed to be the case but that is another
                    matter. The thing I want to mention is that Moldova together with Ukraine and
                    Belarus was one of the three countries in the world granted the right of
                    voluntary departure for Embassy family members and non-essential staff. I don't
                    know how this happened. Somehow Embassy Kiev got this for its people, and then
                    it was extended to Moldova and Belarus. A lot of our Embassy people got free
                    Christmas trips to the U.S. because of this. The bottom line was that the
                    experts believed disaster would occur: computers would collapse, lights go out,
                    utilities fail, and so on. We were all instructed to stock up on food and water,
                    and I as the Ambassador was instructed to be in the Embassy building at the
                    stroke of midnight on December 31, 1999 to assist with the impending chaos. Well
                    I was in the Embassy at midnight. It was a New Year's Eve I will never forget.
                    The clock struck 12:00, and we all waited with bated breath to see what would
                    happen. Of course nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. If anything, things
                    worked better than before because the Moldovans had taken some of our advice to
                    heart about improving their computer systems. But even without that, I doubt
                    anything would have happened. The experts were totally wrong and did not seem to
                    understand how few things actually were computerized in that part of the world.
                    It was a lesson to me about how you cannot always believe the experts. And the
                    Moldovans, of course, all thought we were a little crazy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminded me of the religious groups that expect the
                        world to end, give away all their possessions and go up on the mountain to
                        sing hymns and await judgment day. I remember how nothing happened after
                        Y2K.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The other episode I wanted to mention was about the tragedy that did
                    happen and we did not expect, and that is 9/11. We were scheduled to leave
                    Moldova on September 15, 2001. We had our tickets arranged and a full week of
                    farewell dinners scheduled. And of course 9/11 made it a completely different
                    week that I will never forget. The reaction of the Moldovans was incredible. I
                    would never have imagined such a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy and support.
                    The entire sidewalk in front of the Embassy was covered with flowers and candles
                    that people brought. Classes of schoolchildren sent condolence letters to the
                    Embassy. We opened a condolence book that even President Voronin came to the
                    Embassy to sign, and a special memorial service was held by the Orthodox Church
                    in the city's main cathedral. It was a very touching experience because the
                    sympathy was so genuine and sincere. Of course, we cancelled all our farewell
                    dinners but had a very moving farewell with the Moldovan people. We flew to the
                    U.S. on September 23 after U.S. airports were reopened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>PERINA: My next assignment was Washington-based but involved a lot of travel. My
                    title was Special Negotiator for Eurasian Conflicts, which basically meant
                    conflicts in the former Soviet Union. It was a job with the rank of Ambassador,
                    though I did not have to go through confirmation because I already had the
                    title. I worked simultaneously on resolution of four of the conflicts in the
                    former Soviet Union. These were the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia
                    and Azerbaijan, the two conflicts in Georgia resulting from the secession of
                    Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the Transnistrian conflict in Moldova. The
                    Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was the major responsibility in the portfolio, and the
                    one I spent the bulk of my time on. You will notice that I did not work on the
                    Chechnya conflict in Russia. That is primarily because Russia was not interested
                    in any outside assistance, and we could not help if Russia did not cooperate. So
                    we handled Chechnya as a human rights problem within Russia. The four conflicts
                    I did work on where all different in nature and had different mediation
                    procedures so it is probably best if we discuss them one by one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I was appointed right when I left Moldova in September of 2001 and I held
                    the job until May of 2004. I made 29 trips to Europe within that period in
                    connection with this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived back here, what was the basic position of
                        the Administration toward these conflicts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: With regard to the major conflict I dealt with, Nagorno-Karabakh, people
                    felt they had just been burned. In April 2001 there had been a large meeting
                    organized by the U.S., by my predecessor Carey Cavanaugh, in Key West, Florida.
                    (President) Robert Kocharian of Armenia and (President) Heydar Aliyev of
                    Azerbaijan attended, as did the new Secretary of State Colin Powell. There was a
                    lot of media attention and expectation that an agreement would be signed. Well,
                    the meeting ended in failure, and it was an embarrassment for Powell and the
                    Bush Administration. Carey Cavanaugh spent the next six months trying to revive
                    the negotiating effort but could not do so. So when I came in, there was a sense
                    that any progress was unlikely in the near future. It was a little akin to when
                    I went to Belgrade in that there was a deep, pessimism about future prospects. I
                    like those kinds of challenges, however, because you have no place to go but
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let's talk about Nagorno-Karabakh. What were the issues
                        and why had the talks failed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>PERINA: Nagorno-Karabakh is the most significant conflict still in the Caucasus
                    and the most dangerous unresolved conflict that broke out when Soviet Union
                    dissolved. It actually has far older roots and a complex history and the
                    conflict started even before the Soviet Union broke up. But the worst fighting
                    took place roughly from 1991 to 1994 between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It was a
                    bloody war, and the casualty figures are disputed but probably were about 20,000
                    killed and 60,000 wounded, with close to a million refugees. Even though
                    Nagorno-Karabakh itself only had a population of about 200,000, the refugees
                    came from Armenians who fled Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis displaced from Armenia.
                    It was a serious war. The region of Nagorno-Karabakh itself had a majority
                    Armenian population but was made an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan by Stalin in
                    1923. As the Soviet Union weakened, the Armenian population did not want to
                    remain within Azerbaijan and declared independence in 1991. This led to the war
                    which really then became a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
                <p>The worst fighting stopped with a ceasefire in 1994, and the Armenians have since
                    then controlled both Nagorno-Karabakh and a large area of land around it as
                    well. Until the conflict is somehow resolved, the international community
                    considers that Nagorno-Karabakh is still a part of Azerbaijan, and that is U.S.
                    policy as well. No country, not even Armenia, has thus far recognized
                    Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent country. So that is the situation on the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>Now as for the mediation mechanism, the organization that has been tasked from
                    the very beginning to try to help find a solution is the Organization for
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE, and specifically a sub-group of
                    countries called the Minsk Group. The Minsk Group in turn agreed on countries
                    referred to as the “Co-Chairs” of the Minsk Group to serve as specific mediators
                    to help the two sides find a solution. For a long time the Co-Chairs were Russia
                    and Sweden but then that arrangement was changed in 1997, and a troika of
                    Co-Chairs was agreed upon from France, Russia and the United States. So that is
                    the history in a nutshell. I was appointed as the U.S. representative to the
                    Minsk Group and thus one of the three Co-Chair mediators. The French and the
                    Russians also appointed Ambassadors approximately at my level but interestingly
                    the Russians also had a First Deputy Foreign Minister who took an interest in
                    the conflict and participated in many of the trips and negotiating sessions.
                    Thus the Russians often had the most senior delegation member among the
                    Co-Chairs because they had a person who was number two or three in the Foreign
                    Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q.: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: His name was Vyacheslav Trubnikov, and he was appointed First Deputy
                    Foreign Minister in 2000. He later became the Russian Ambassador to India. I
                    spent a lot of time with him and got to know him quite well. One of the
                    interesting things about him was that he worked in the Foreign Ministry but
                    during Soviet times had actually been a KGB officer. He freely admitted this and
                    made no effort to hide it. He was in fact proud that he had risen to the level
                    of Colonel in the KGB.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Anyway, to get back to the negotiations, there had over the years been many
                    proposals by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to find a solution and each one had been
                    rejected by one side or the other. They included the basic ways one can solve a
                    conflict like this: mediation, territorial exchange, autonomy, confederation and
                    so on. The Key West approach, which was sort of a land for peace swap, also
                    failed. Ironically, most of these deals failed over what by an outsider could be
                    considered secondary issues, issues like the status of the corridor between
                    Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh since they are not contiguous. This was the case
                    also in Key West, although there is debate still on whether the leaders really
                    see these issues as important or just make the secondary issues deal-breakers
                    because they get cold feet on the whole approach and just want to get out of it.
                    Key West, for example, was a very good deal for the Armenian side, probably the
                    best deal they had ever been offered. But Azerbaijani President Aliyev started
                    raising objections on secondary issues, and Kocharian did not show any
                    flexibility to accommodate him, so it all came apart, and it was a real shame.
                    Things really seemed at a dead end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this where you took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: This is where I took over and tried to figure out how to move forward. I
                    was the new Co-Chair. The Russians and French were a bit burned out by Key West,
                    and they looked to me, to the U.S., for new ideas. For a few months, I did try
                    to see if it was at all possible to resurrect the Key West approach but in fact
                    it was not. The two Presidents were in a bad mood. They were angry at one
                    another for the failure of Key West, and accusing each other of bad faith. I
                    realized we might be facing a real lull in negotiation before new ideas could be
                    developed. But a lull could be very dangerous in terms of public perceptions in
                    Azerbaijan. The Azeris were the side most frustrated with the status quo. They
                    saw their land as occupied and wanted progress in resolving this. If they had no
                    perception of an ongoing negotiation, then the Azeri public might start
                    concluding that war was the only way to change things. For this reason it was
                    important to maintain a process, at least an ongoing dialogue that showed people
                    the sides were still talking with one another.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>I laid out this idea to the other Co-Chairs at a meeting in Washington in
                    December 2001. I said that we had to demand that the two Presidents agree to
                    regularly-scheduled meetings at a neutral location to which they would send
                    their personal representatives. If the representatives did nothing but stare at
                    each other for a day, so be it. But we would force them to continue having
                    meetings and keep the structure of a process in place. The two other Co-Chairs
                    agreed, and we started sounding out the two sides. They were both very receptive
                    because they also understood that a visible process of negotiation was in their
                    interest. To be sure, there were some hitches. At first, the Armenian side
                    insisted that the Karabakh Armenians had to be included. Recent talks had all
                    been just between Aliyev and Kocharian, and we knew that Aliyev would not agree
                    to including two Armenian reps. Kocharian dropped this, and other problems were
                    worked out. During a visit that we the Co-Chairs made to Yerevan and Baku in
                    March 2002, the two presidents formally agreed to start new negotiations through
                    their Personal Representatives. We later agreed that these would take place in
                    Prague, and this was the start of what came to be called the “Prague Process”
                    which is the foundation of the talks that continue to the present day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prague! Do I guess correctly that you had something to do
                        with picking this city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I admit I did but there was a rationale behind it. We agreed among the
                    Co-Chairs that we wanted these new talks near Vienna, which is the headquarters
                    of the OSCE, but not directly in Vienna where other Minsk Group country
                    delegations might try to get involved. We also wanted the talks in Eastern
                    rather than Western Europe just because it would be less expensive, and the OSCE
                    would be paying all the costs of the meetings. It basically came down to Warsaw,
                    Prague or Budapest. What decided it was that Prague had a small, permanent OSCE
                    office that dated from the early 1990's when some OSCE Permanent Council
                    meetings were held there. The office was a type of secretariat, and it was
                    underemployed. We saw that this would be a great help in all the administrative
                    and logistical organization of these meetings, since the Co-Chairs had no
                    standing staff except the assistants to the three Ambassadors. I admit I also
                    did favor Prague because I knew the city, the language and had good contacts
                    with some Czech diplomats. But those were secondary considerations. The
                    Co-Chairs agreed on Prague and so did the Armenians and Azeris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Czechs happy when they learned this would be
                        coming to town?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>PERINA: They were very happy. I raised it first with the Czech Ambassador to the
                    OSCE. He reported it to the Czech Foreign Ministry, and in less than a week we
                    had Czech acceptance of the proposal. We made a trip to Prague to work out the
                    terms, and the Czechs even gave us free use of a beautiful palace called Stirin
                    about 45 minutes outside of Prague. Initially, each President nominated a
                    Personal Representative at the deputy foreign minister level. For the Armenians
                    it was Tatoul Markarian, later an Armenian Ambassador to Washington, and for the
                    Azeri side it was Araz Azimov. The first meeting of the Prague process took
                    place at Stirin Palace on May 13-15, 2002. The Czech Foreign Minister attended
                    the inaugural session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Well, we started again exploring ideas and options for a solution. The
                    talks really started almost from the beginning. But this was the process I was
                    involved in for the next two years. As the Prague Process continued, it changed
                    a little in format. We began meeting in other cities as well with the Presidents
                    and Foreign Ministers. Toward the end of my tour, the Prague Process was
                    upgraded when the Presidents nominated their Foreign Ministers, rather than
                    Deputy Foreign Ministers, as their representatives. It was almost moved from the
                    Stirin Palace to a venue very near the Prague Castle just for convenience sake.
                    The last Minsk Group meeting I had was in Prague in April 2004 when the Armenian
                    and Azeri foreign ministers met as the Personal Representatives.</p>
                <p>One thing I should clarify. When I said the Co-Chairs were mediators, that was
                    perhaps misleading. The role of the Co-Chairs was not to mediate in the sense of
                    to arbitrate. We were more in the role of facilitators, helping to come up with
                    ideas but not in a position to impose them on either side. We were there to be

                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The largest group of Armenians outside of Armenia is probably in Russia.
                    The Azeris knew all this and probably were not happy with it, but they trusted
                    us. They knew they had their own sources of influence, which included their
                    strategic location and their oil. The Armenians in fact believed that the
                    international community tended to favor Azerbaijan because of the oil factor.
                    The Azeris also felt that international law was on their side. Nagorno-Karabakh
                    was considered legally a part of Azerbaijan by all three Co-Chairs. So the
                    Azeris argued sovereignty, while the Armenians argued the right of self
                    determination and self-defense for Nagorno-Karabakh. Each side had different
                    assets and a different approach, but the Co-Chairs tried to be fair to both. Our
                    position was that any solution that the two sides could agree upon would be
                    acceptable to us. We were there to help the two sides find such a solution.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What pressures were on Armenia and Azerbaijan to find a
                        solution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The Armenian side was holding all the land so they were much more a
                    status quo power than Azerbaijan. The problem for the Armenians was that they
                    were landlocked and surrounded on most of their border by Turkey and Azerbaijan,
                    who had closed borders and imposed a trade blockade as a result of the war.
                    There was a real economic cost from this for the Armenians. For Azerbaijan, the
                    main problem was that about 15% of what they saw as their land was under foreign
                    occupation. They wanted the land back. The refugee problem also put political
                    pressure on Baku. There were about half a million refugees from each side as a
                    result of the war. The Armenians had largely integrated their refugee
                    population, but the Azeris had not. They still claimed they had several hundred
                    thousand living in camps. At one point, we the Co-Chairs visited an Azeri
                    refugee camp, and it was really appalling to see the conditions under which
                    these families lived ten years after the war. They were living under terrible
                    conditions in these crowded refugee compounds. Of course, the fact is that the
                    Azerbaijani government purposely kept them so for political reasons. They wanted
                    them as evidence of what an injustice had been done to the Azeri side. So after
                    a decade they had not integrated them, even though Azerbaijan certainly had the
                    resources from oil revenues to do so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening on the ground in the disputed
                        territory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Nagorno-Karabakh is a dangerous conflict because it's one of the few
                    stalemated conflicts where there are no peacekeeping troops to separate the
                    sides. What separates the two armies are enormous mine fields and trenches and
                    snipers. There are still a few soldiers on both sides killed almost monthly by
                    sniper fire. Obviously, this is an uneasy truce that can easily break down. The
                    first time I visited Nagorno-Karabakh, we physically crossed the front lines
                    from Azerbaijan into Nagorno-Karabakh. It was a revealing but very difficult
                    experience. It had to be worked out with both sides, of course. Both sides had
                    to clear a path through the minefields. We then walked for several hundred yards
                    along this path, which was only about a yard wide and marked with a string, in
                    single file and carrying our suitcases. I could literally see some of these
                    mines sticking out of the ground on both sides of the path. It was frightening.
                    Worst of all, one of the Azeri soldiers who was clearing the minefield triggered
                    a mine and lost a leg about 15 minutes before we crossed. We just heard an
                    explosion and commotion and then learned what happened. We arranged through the
                    OSCE to give some monetary compensation to the soldier and to his family but how
                    can you compensate someone for the loss of a leg? After that, I told the other
                    Co-Chairs that it was the first and last time I would cross in this fashion
                    because it was not worth the cost of people getting hurt. The Azeris agreed that
                    we could go into Nagorno-Karabakh from the Armenian side, even though
                    politically they did not like it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was keeping the negotiations from making some
                        progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>PERINA: There were a number of reasons why the talks didn't progress. One of them
                    was that both sides felt that time was on their side. The Azeris felt they were
                    going to get all of this incredible oil revenue and they would be able to
                    increase their military strength and overwhelm the Armenians who were losing
                    population through emigration and in bad economic straits. On the other hand,
                    the Armenians also felt that time was on their side simply because they were
                    holding the land and creating a type of fait accompli. One Armenian said to me,
                    “In a generation, how many young Azeris will want to die for Nagorno-Karabakh?”
                    But both sides were wrong in thinking that time worked for them. The Azeris were
                    wrong in thinking that oil money translates easily into military prowess. If
                    that were true, the Middle East would look very different than it does today. It
                    is just not that simple. But the Armenians were also wrong in thinking that
                    people in this part of the world forget old grudges and conflicts. In fact,
                    these issues are passed remarkably from generation to generation, as is the case
                    among Armenians themselves. So both sides were mistaken in their views but it
                    made resolution of the conflict very difficult.</p>
                <p>Another complication we had in the talks was that in December 2003 President
                    Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan died. He passed away in the U.S., in the Cleveland
                    Clinic, where he was being treated for heart problems that he had had for many
                    years. He had arranged things so that his son Ilham Aliyev would be the likely
                    successor as President, but we still lost about a year through the whole process
                    of transferring power from the old Aliyev to the son. It was also a setback
                    because the older Aliyev was an extremely powerful figure in Azerbaijan. We
                    always assumed that he, if anyone, had the political strength to make the kinds
                    of compromises that would be needed for a settlement. The son Ilham was
                    politically weaker and had acquired a reputation as a bit of a playboy and not a
                    serious leader. However, I must say that when he became President and the
                    Co-Chairs started working with him, we were all very impressed by how
                    intelligent and capable he actually was. He was a serious and thoughtful
                    interlocutor. That was a welcome surprise, although we still lost a lot of time
                    with the transfer of leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working with the Armenians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think we worked quite well with them also, although Kocharian was a
                    very tough negotiator. Too tough, in my view. I think he lost some good
                    opportunities by not being a little more flexible. The real asset on the
                    Armenian side was the Foreign Minister, Vartan Oskanian, who was very capable
                    and engaging to work with. He was born of Armenian parents in Syria but had in
                    fact been raised in the United States and became a U.S. citizen before moving to
                    independent Armenia. He was very straightforward and informal but still very
                    effective. It was like dealing with an American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the status of the talks when your assignment
                        ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, I am glad you ask that because in fact it was not all bleak. We did
                    make some progress, and it stemmed from an idea I got when reading about the
                    EU-managed referendum on independence in Montenegro. It occurred to me that the
                    concept of a referendum as a way of dealing with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
                    had not been explored in previous negotiation attempts. I first raised the idea
                    one evening in July 2002 on the grounds of the Stirin Palace with the Armenian
                    representative, Tatoul Markarian. This was during the second formal meeting of
                    the Prague Process. He seemed very skeptical but said he would report it to his
                    boss, Foreign Minister Oskanian. A few days later he drew me aside and said that
                    the Armenian side was not interested in this approach. I assumed it was because
                    the Armenians were still hoping to somehow resurrect Key West. In any case, I
                    thought the referendum idea was dead. But then about a year later, both
                    Markarian and Oskanian started telling me that they would be interested in
                    exploring this. They even started asking me to put it formally on the table. I
                    think it was because the Azerbaijani message got through that there was no way
                    in the world Baku would return to the Key West approach. We sounded out the
                    Azeri side about the referendum, and they also were initially very skeptical.
                    Then in late 2003 Aliyev told us, that is to say the Co-Chairs, that he was
                    willing to discuss this idea. Agreement on this approach led to the elevation of
                    the Prague talks to the level of Foreign Minister. By the time I had my last
                    meeting as a Minsk Group Co-Chair with the Azeri and Armenian Foreign Ministers
                    in April 2004 in Prague, the referendum approach was the major one on the table.
                    In fact, despite a lot of permutations since then, it is basically the approach
                    that my successor Steve Mann worked on and his successor Matt Bryza has worked
                    on. Unfortunately though, as is obvious, it also has not brought any resolution
                    of the conflict, at least not so far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the referendum supposed to work? Who would
                        participate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, you touch on a key issue because in fact the concept of how the
                    referendum would work has evolved a lot since the original idea that I had. The
                    way I imagined it was that all of the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh prior to the
                    conflict who were still living would be eligible to vote. There apparently were
                    registration lists from the Soviet days that would make it possible to identify
                    them. There would be polling places in Azerbaijan for the refugees, and so on.
                    It would be difficult but it was possible, and the OSCE would have organized the
                    voting. In all likelihood, the Armenians who were about three-quarters of the
                    population of Karabakh before the war would have won the referendum but the
                    occupied territories around Karabakh would have been returned to Azerbaijan in
                    any case. So the outcome would have been similar to Key West but more managed
                    and in response to a more acceptable process, i.e. a referendum, rather than
                    just the result of a war. This would have been a final resolution of the
                    conflict. The way the referendum idea developed after I left, however, was
                    somewhat different. It became a means to postpone a final resolution of the
                    conflict to a referendum many years down the road but to set up an agreed
                    interim solution that would stabilize the conflict and allow the occupied
                    territories to be returned to Azerbaijan and the economic blockade of Armenia to
                    be lifted. Determining the final status of Karabakh would thus be kicked down
                    the road but under terms that all agreed upon and that would stabilize the
                    situation. It was a fair approach. Sometimes freezing a conflict under agreed
                    terms can be a way of resolving it, for all practical purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does Nagorno-Karabakh have a land connection to
                        Armenia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No, not geographically. This was another big problem. The Armenians were
                    holding a land corridor from the war that connected the two but the corridor was
                    outside of Nagorno-Karabakh proper. So the question of what corridor could be
                    agreed upon in a settlement was an issue. The Armenians of course wanted a
                    corridor with the most security, something that would have more or less the same
                    status as Karabakh. For Azerbaijan, this was clearly both a political problem
                    and a practical one since it would divide regions within Azerbaijan unless it
                    could be crossed and also used by Azerbaijani citizens. This was one of the
                    issues that led to the failure of Key West. It is an issue that comes up with
                    every proposed resolution scheme, but it will have to be part of any final
                    resolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was team cooperation among the three Co-Chairs? Could
                        you work well with the French and Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>PERINA: I have to tell you that in this case we worked very well together, all
                    three of us. This may have been because it was a conflict that no one could
                    really control, not even the Russians. It was a true indigenous conflict between
                    Armenia and Azerbaijan. It wasn't like the other secessions that I worked on,
                    those in Georgia and Moldova, that were assisted by Russia and only viable with
                    Russian support. With Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia could possibly bloc a settlement
                    but it could not make one happen. Nobody could force a settlement on the
                    Armenians and the Azeris. It was too big and too emotional an issue for both
                    sides. So there was less opportunity for Russia to pursue its own agenda. With
                    the French, I think we were very lucky with the negotiators. The first French
                    Ambassador I worked with, Philippe de Suremain, was absolutely first-rate. He
                    later became the French Ambassador to Kiev. Sometimes the three of us, that is
                    the three Co-Chairs, were telling one another that if we could find a solution
                    to this conflict it would be an important symbol of the United States, Russia
                    and the European Union, as represented by France, jointly resolving a real
                    international problem. It was a nice idea but it did not work, though the fault
                    was not lack of Co-Chair cooperation. The problem was the complexity of the
                    problem and the intransigence of the parties. My own personal opinion now is
                    that for the time being probably the most you can hope for is stabilizing this
                    conflict rather than really resolving it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the influence of the Armenian lobby in the
                        United States on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Certainly I knew there was a lot of interest in this issue on the Hill
                    and in the Armenian community in America. One of the reasons the U.S. had gotten
                    more deeply involved in this issue by becoming a Co-Chair was in response to
                    pressure on the Administration to do more in finding a resolution of the
                    conflict. So in a sense, I owed the creation of my job, the existence of the
                    Special Negotiator position, to the Armenian lobby. But I must say that apart
                    from the interest, there was no effort by the Hill or the Armenian community to
                    push us in a particular direction in the negotiations. It was more a case of
                    keeping people informed of progress and so on. I regularly briefed staffers and
                    also members on the Hill about the talks, and I also met with Armenian community
                    leaders. I visited Glendale, California, home of one of the largest Armenian
                    communities in the United States. There is even a local Armenian television
                    station there. I gave interviews and had a number of public meetings. It was
                    mainly an effort to reassure people that we were working on the problem and had
                    not forgotten it. I did not go into any details of the negotiations because
                    these were always very tightly held. But I always had good meetings, and I think
                    people trusted us to be fair. Besides, I always had the impression that the
                    American Armenian community was really more interested in the genocide issue
                    than in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the next conflict you worked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>PERINA: Let's turn to Abkhazia. This is a region on the Black Sea within Georgia
                    that seceded from Georgia when the Soviet Union came apart. The reasons also
                    stemmed from ethnic hatred with a very long history. There was a war between
                    Georgians and Abkhaz in 1992, and it was a very cruel and bloody war. Probably
                    twenty to thirty thousand people were killed, with atrocities committed on both
                    sides. I recognized the minute I started working on this that it would be the
                    most difficult of the four conflicts in my portfolio to resolve. The hatred
                    between Abkhaz and Georgians was the worst I had ever seen in either the Balkans
                    or the Caucasus. It was even greater than that between Serbs and Albanians. This
                    was for historic reasons but also because of the cruelty and nature of the war.
                    It was an unusual war. In most ethnic conflicts of this sort a majority
                    ethnically cleanses a minority. In Abkhazia, however, the reverse was true. The
                    Abkhaz had been an ethnic minority of about 100 thousand people out of half a
                    million but with Russian and Chechen help they ethnically cleansed several
                    hundred thousand Georgians. The entire region after the war had a population of
                    about 175 thousand, which is fewer than the number of displaced Georgians. This
                    meant that the Abkhaz were dead set against any settlement that would allow even
                    a portion of the Georgians to return, which was the prime demand of the
                    Georgians. So there was very little common ground to work with for a
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>I always believed that another reason for the difficulty of resolving this
                    conflict was that Abkhazia was really worth fighting over. It is gorgeous, with
                    mountains coming right down to the Black Sea. Since I was the negotiator, I had
                    opportunity to visit all of these secessionist regions, even though American
                    diplomats were normally restricted from travel there because we did not
                    recognize the regimes. I never found Transnistria or Nagorno-Karabakh or for
                    that matter Kosovo particularly attractive, and South Ossetia least of all. But
                    Abkhazia is prime real estate, potentially a big Club Med. I visited during
                    tangerine season, and there were these orchards of tangerine trees right by the
                    seacoast with a Mediterranean climate and beautiful scenery. It was also
                    fascinating because driving from Georgia proper to Sukhumi, the capital of
                    Abkhazia, there were all these abandoned houses and villas along the road. This
                    was because after 200,000 Georgians were expelled, the Abkhaz could not fully
                    populate the area. There were some groups that started coming, particularly
                    Russians and Armenians, but it was not enough to re-populate the region and fill
                    all those abandoned homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Russians in the region?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>PERINA: There were, in many different capacities. There were a growing number of
                    Russian tourists and also Russian investors and businessmen who saw the
                    potential of the area. There were several Russian bases in Georgia, including in
                    Abkhazia, that were a holdover from Soviet days but still held by the Russians.
                    But most importantly, there was a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia of several
                    thousand Russian troops. This had been part of the ceasefire arrangements in
                    1994. The peacekeeping force was supposed to be a CIS (Confederation of
                    Independent States) force but in practice it was all Russian, and it was one of
                    the big political problems. The Georgians agreed to the force in 1994 but
                    thereafter recognized that it was really functioning as a protective force for
                    Abkhazia. In my time, the Georgians were always demanding that the Russians pull
                    out but then backed away after the Abkhaz said this would lead to a renewed war.
                    This was a lot of discussion of finding a substitute force from other countries
                    but no agreement was ever reached on one, and not many countries volunteered to
                    be peacekeepers. So there was always a crisis when the time came for the annual
                    renewal of the CIS peacekeeping mandate but in fact it was always renewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did the negotiations work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: The negotiating structure was totally different from the one in
                    Nagorno-Karabakh. The United Nations was in charge of this conflict and not the
                    OSCE. There was in fact a United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG)
                    that was responsible for overseeing the ceasefire and the work of the
                    peacekeepers. This did not work very well because the Russian general in charge
                    of the peacekeepers did not feel at all responsible to a civilian UN diplomat
                    who was in charge of the Mission. UNOMIG had a presence of several hundred
                    people in Sukhumi but this was no match to several thousand Russian troops. The
                    UN role did determine that the political negotiations regarding Abkhazia took
                    place in UN contexts, on many different levels. There was a formal negotiating
                    process of which we were not members and that involved the United Nations,
                    Russia, the Georgians and the Abkhaz. This very soon got bogged down and was not
                    going anywhere. Then there were negotiations in New York, in the Security
                    Council, within a group called the Friends of the Secretary General on Georgia.
                    This friends group was basically a number of countries that had expressed
                    interest in this conflict and met periodically to discuss it and give
                    recommendations to the Secretary General. The Friends Group included the United
                    States, Russia, France, the UK and Germany, among a few others. So a lot of
                    negotiating was done in this context. But then in addition, a special mechanism
                    was set up in my time to try to activate discussions between the Georgians and
                    the Abkhaz. This effort was undertaken by the UN Undersecretary for
                    Peacekeeping, a Frenchman named Jean Marie Gu�henno. He organized a series of
                    meetings at UN headquarters in Geneva to discuss the Abkhaz issue among the key
                    members of the Friends Group and with the Georgians and Abkhaz. I was the U.S.
                    representative to these meetings, and the first three were held in my time—in
                    February and July of 2003 and then in February of 2004. The first one involved
                    just the UN, U.S., UK, Russia, France and Germany, and the following two
                    included the Georgians and the Abkhaz.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything come of these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Unfortunately, I can't say it did. Within the Friends group, the Russians
                    were clearly protective of the Abkhaz, and when we did get an Abkhaz
                    representative to Geneva, he was absolutely unrelenting in refusal to engage in
                    any discussion that would imply the slightest Georgian sovereignty over
                    Abkhazia. And this was supposedly one of the more moderate Abkhaz leaders, their
                    so-called Foreign Minister Sergey Shamba. So the effort was made and a lot of
                    opportunity for talks existed but the process never took off. I think perhaps
                    the only function of it—and this is something of value—was again that the
                    existence of the process reduced the pressure on the Georgian side for military
                    action against Abkhazia. The Georgian government was under a lot of pressure
                    from the 200,000 refugees to do something about Abkhazia. If a negotiating
                    process had not existed, the calls for war would have been even greater. As I
                    was leaving the Special Negotiator job, I felt that this was the most dangerous
                    of the conflicts I had worked on, and that a definite danger existed that it
                    could erupt into a hot war. It became even more dangerous and unstable after
                    Saakashvili became President of Georgia. During my tenure, the President was
                    still Shevardnadze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the Rose Revolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: No. That came after I left. I was there during Shevardnadze's time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Shevardnadze's attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I met with him a couple of times during my visits to Tbilisi. Frankly, he
                    was a bit past his prime. There was a lot of unhappiness with him among
                    Georgians, and his popularity ratings had fallen to single digits in some polls.
                    He said all the right things about resolving the Abkhaz conflict but there
                    wasn't much energy behind the words. He was confused on how to go forward and
                    seemed just to be coasting in his presidency. Our meetings were pleasant but
                    never very productive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he afraid to stand up to the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>PERINA: It is difficult to say. He was critical of the Russians, though certainly
                    not as much as his successor Saakashvili. The Russians were playing a dirty game
                    in Abkhazia. Formally they said they were against secession but in practice they
                    did everything to help Abkhazia stay independent of Georgia. This was similar to
                    what they were doing in Transnistria and South Ossetia. The Russians could have
                    helped force a settlement if they wanted to. Abkhazia is not really viable as an
                    independent state. It has less than 200,000 people since the end of the
                    fighting. It would have a very difficult time remaining independent. Probably,
                    it would sooner or later join Russia, and that may be exactly what the Russians
                    are hoping. During my time, I had the suspicion that the Russians and Abkhaz
                    were working toward an eventual partition of the region in which a strip in the
                    south would go to Georgia and the rest join Russia. There is a region in the
                    south of Abkhazia called Gali where in fact the Abkhaz had a very different
                    policy than in the rest of Abkhazia. They were allowing Georgian refugees to
                    return and so on. They may have been working toward an eventual partition as a
                    compromise with Georgia to end the conflict. But this is just a suspicion based
                    on what was happening in Gali. I have no real evidence for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any analysis from our Embassy in Moscow
                        on Russian policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I visited Moscow frequently during this time and worked closely with our
                    Embassy. But it was equally difficult for them to analyze Russian intentions. I
                    also think that perhaps Russian policy was not always consistent or coordinated.
                    It may have been much more haphazard and based on conflicting interests than we
                    assume. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow was not a particularly strong institution
                    at this time and probably not in a position to call all the shorts. There were
                    business interests, political considerations, pressures from Russian
                    nationalists in the Duma and so on that may have influenced aspects of Russian
                    policy. I think we sometimes give them too much credit in assuming their policy
                    is a coherent whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, what is the next conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>PERINA: That would be South Ossetia, a small region in the north of Georgia on
                    the Russian border. It is only about two and a half hours by car from Tbilisi.
                    It is called South Ossetia because there is a North Ossetia within Russia
                    proper, right across the border. This is another case of secession by an ethnic
                    group that did not want to be part of an independent Georgia. The story is
                    similar to that of Abkhazia but on a smaller and far more muted scale. There was
                    also a hot war between South Ossetians and Georgians in 1991 and a ceasefire
                    imposed on Georgia by Russia in 1992. Probably about a thousand people died in
                    the fighting, and tens of thousands of Ossetians fled to the north, into Russia.
                    South Ossetia had a population of about 100,000 before the war, divided roughly
                    into two-thirds Ossetians and one-third Georgians. The population now is
                    probably not more than 70,000, in roughly the same proportion. You can see that
                    this was a smaller war, and the stakes are smaller than in Abkhazia. It also was
                    not as brutal. But still it remains an unresolved conflict because the region
                    does not accept Georgian sovereignty and is protected in this by Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it seem that this conflict could be resolved more
                        easily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Definitely. This is what many people believed, and I believed as well.
                    There was a different dynamic to this conflict. The hatreds were not as deep as
                    in Abkhazia or Nagorno-Karabakh. In fact, most of the history of the region had
                    been peaceful. Inter-marriages between Georgians and Ossetians were not unusual.
                    The outburst of Georgian nationalism after independence had sparked the conflict
                    but there seemed to be hope of bringing the ethnic groups together again. There
                    was no more violence underway by the time I got involved, and a peacekeeping
                    force of Russian, Georgian and Ossetian forces, plus an OSCE monitoring mission,
                    were keeping things fairly quiet. The conventional wisdom about South Ossetia
                    was that it was not a dangerous conflict and that the Ossetians were waiting to
                    see how the Abkhaz conflict would be resolved and then try to piggy-back on it
                    in cutting a deal with the Georgians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well, that would depend of what kind of deal the Abkhaz cut. But at one
                    point I had the notion that perhaps we should try reversing this—rather than
                    waiting for South Ossetia to copy Abkhazia, we should start by resolving South
                    Ossetia and seeing if that might help promote an Abkhazia settlement. So I made
                    a trip by car to the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali to meet with the
                    leadership. Unfortunately, however, there was a power struggle underway within
                    this leadership. A rather moderate President, or so-called President, who many
                    thought would be willing to find a resolution of the conflict had just been
                    replaced with strong Russian backing by a hardliner named Eduard Kokoity.
                    Kokoity was in Moscow when I visited and so I was told I could only meet with
                    one of his deputies, a person so unremarkable that I honestly do not remember
                    his name, though it will be in the reporting cable. He was also pretty hardline
                    in not willing to even discuss any compromise to South Ossetia's so-called
                    independence. The one thing he did want to discuss was any possibility of
                    American economic assistance to the region. This was not surprising given the
                    incredible poverty of the region, which was the most salient thing that I
                    remember about it. Tskhinvali was this dusty little town with empty streets and
                    hardly any people that I could see. It was a very depressing place. There was
                    more life to be seen on the road to and from Tbilisi but it consisted largely of
                    open air markets where things like old automobiles and machinery appeared to be
                    on sale. I was later told that this was indeed part of the basically
                    black-market economy of South Ossetia, where stolen and custom-free goods were
                    sold and smuggled into Georgia proper. Like Transnistria except on a smaller and
                    poorer scale, South Ossetia basically found a niche in black-market dealings.
                    One person facetiously called it a big parking lot for stolen cars.</p>

                <p>PERINA: I think it was a big part of the reason. I would say two things kept it
                    going: the economic interests that stemmed from the black market and then
                    Russia. There was probably a lot of overlap between these two. The Russians had
                    both economic and political interests to keep it going. My impression, and
                    everything I heard from other observers, was that most of the population would
                    have been ready for a settlement. There was in particular a real desire for
                    Western economic assistance. The region was terribly poor. One Westerner in
                    Georgia who had been watching the situation for a long time told me that
                    basically South Ossetia could be bought for 100 million dollars. Not literally
                    bought, of course. He meant that an offer of such an assistance program would
                    convince most South Ossetians to re-join Georgia. I think that the European
                    Union tried the approach of offering a large amount of assistance. The European
                    Union in fact took a special interest in this conflict, perhaps also thinking
                    that it was the one most likely to be solved. The EU was looking for projects to
                    enhance its international profile and would very much have wanted itself to be
                    seen as the main force in resolving one of the frozen conflicts in the Caucasus.
                    The EU did a lot in South Ossetia but the main reason it all failed was, in my
                    view, Russian resistance. Moscow was just not ready to give up the region,
                    particularly after Saakashvili came to office and RussianGeorgian relations
                    plummeted. The Russians wanted to hold South Ossetia, if only as additional
                    leverage against Georgia.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the fourth conflict you dealt with was
                        Transnistria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: That's right, the Transnistrian secession in Moldova. We have talked
                    about this conflict before since I already worked on it when I was the
                    Ambassador to Moldova. I just changed hats and continued to work on it as the
                    Special Negotiator. Of course, this was still in sort of an ex-officio capacity
                    since the U.S. was not one of the designated mediators. We just tried to use our
                    influence to promote progress in the talks. A formal role for the U.S. and the
                    EU came later, after I left, when we were formally designated as participating
                    in the OSCE talks. When I became Special Negotiator I knew this conflict quite
                    well, I knew Smirnov and all the players, and thus was in a position to be
                    helpful. I also still believed that this should be the easiest conflict to
                    resolve, even easier than South Ossetia. The economic stakes of the black market
                    were probably much higher but Moldova had the advantage of not being on Russia's
                    border, as Georgia was. Transnistria was not contiguous with Russian territory
                    as South Ossetia and Abkhazia were, and this made it more difficult for the
                    Russians to maintain a grip on it. At least that was my thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Yes and no. The good news was that Russia in fact was ready to find a
                    settlement, on its terms, to the conflict. The bad news was that its terms
                    included maintaining a status for Transnistria that would largely just have
                    legalized the status quo. I used to characterize the Russian position, in a very
                    simplified way, as follows: The Transnistrians would wink and say “OK, we are
                    part of Moldova,” and the Moldovans would wink and say “OK. The conflict is
                    resolved.” But otherwise, Transnistria would be given so much autonomy that
                    everything else would stay the same: the Russian presence, the black
                    marketeering, the state within a state structure and so on. In fact, all of
                    these things would be legalized through a settlement. In our view, such a
                    settlement was worse than no settlement at all because it would have been a
                    permanent, institutionalized Russian presence within Moldova and a permanent
                    economic drain on the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a real chance of this happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>PERINA: Absolutely. We in fact came very close to it in December 2003 with the
                    so-called Kozak Memorandum. Dmitriy Kozak, a close confidante of Putin's and his
                    deputy chief of staff, suddenly showed up in Moldova in the fall of 2003 with a
                    mandate to resolve the Transnistria conflict. He did all of the negotiation in
                    shuttle diplomacy between Voronin and Smirnov, and it was a unilateral Russian
                    effort. None of the other mediators were involved. I visited Moldova in late
                    September when he happened to be in town and asked to meet with him. We met for
                    drinks in the lobby of the Jolly Alon Hotel. Kozak was pleasant enough but gave
                    very little information on the substance of the negotiations. He described it as
                    a type of memorandum dealing with the principles of a settlement but not
                    containing many details on implementation. I specifically asked him if there was
                    a military component, such as the question of a peacekeeping force, and he said
                    there was not. A few months later, in mid-November, we were in Moscow with EUR
                    Assistant Secretary Beth Jones to conduct consultations in preparation for the
                    Maastricht OSCE Ministerial meeting, scheduled to be held in early December. It
                    was then that the Russians first showed us a draft of the document being
                    negotiated. They also told us that Voronin had agreed to sign it. Everyone was
                    in total shock. The document was terribly slanted in favor of Transnistria. It
                    outlined a federal structure which retained almost all of Transnistria's
                    independence but also enhanced its influence within Moldova through the
                    legislative structure. The Transnistrians acquired de facto veto power over
                    major Moldovan policy decisions, including on matters of foreign policy. There
                    was also an annex allowing Russian troops to remain in Moldova for twenty years,
                    and perhaps longer. It would have made Moldova a permanent hostage of the
                    Transnistrians.</p>
                <p>The Russians wanted the document signed by Voronin and Smirnov prior to the
                    Maastricht Ministerial meeting, and they thus knew they had to make it public.
                    They put it on an internet website, where it began circulating. The reaction was
                    outrage, not just among Western governments but also among Moldovans. By late
                    November, there were demonstrations in Chisinau of up to 50,000 people by some
                    estimates protesting the memorandum. It seemed neither Voronin nor Kozak had
                    anticipated such a reaction, but Putin was going forward with plans to fly to
                    Chisinau for the signing ceremony early in the week of November 23. I was in
                    Vienna at this time involved in the final OSCE preparations for Maastricht. I
                    remember walking along the street in the early afternoon of November 21 and
                    getting a call on my cell phone. It was Voronin's office saying that he wanted
                    to speak with me. He got on the line and asked me what I thought the U.S.
                    reaction would be if he signed the memorandum. I told him that it would be very
                    negative, and that he would lose the support of the United States and most other
                    Western countries as well. He told me he was reconsidering the entire memorandum
                    and would make a decision that weekend. Well, as we later found out, on the eve
                    of Putin's departure for Chisinau, Voronin told the Russians he would not sign
                    and cancelled the signing ceremony. We heard from many sources after that that
                    Putin was just furious at Voronin. What Putin hoped would be a triumph of
                    Russian peacemaking turned out to be a huge personal embarrassment. It led to a
                    major deterioration in Russian-Moldovan relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Still, the Russians have never given up on the Kozak approach to resolving this
                    conflict, and they continue to put pressure on Voronin to accept such an
                    approach. He has so far resisted, to his credit, but he is unpredictable in
                    these things and could still change his mind. I like to think that I played a
                    role in preventing him for signing the 2003 document, though the situation was
                    such that there were other Western governments d�marching him at the time, and
                    our bilateral Ambassador Heather Hodges also delivered a formal demarche from
                    Washington against signing the memorandum. In retrospect, however, I think the
                    factor that influenced Voronin most were the domestic demonstrations. By
                    coincidence this also happened to be the weekend that Shevardnadze was toppled
                    from power in Georgia by demonstrations—the weekend of the Rose Revolution. I
                    think this is what scared Voronin most. He saw what happened to Shevardnadze.
                    While Moldova's demonstrations were still manageable, Voronin did not want to
                    take the chance of the same thing happening to him and that is why he decided
                    not to sign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given all this, what was your assessment of the U.S. role
                        in all of these frozen conflicts? Was there really a role for the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think there was a role in two respects. First, as I mentioned, it is
                    important to keep a negotiating process, a diplomatic track, going in all of
                    these conflicts. If there is no diplomatic activity, the only alternative for
                    those wishing to change things is war. The participation of the U.S. is
                    important to giving most of these negotiations credibility and support.
                    Secondly, the U.S. role is also important as a counter-weight to the Russians.
                    The Moldovans and others understood this, and that is why they always wanted the
                    U.S. engaged in the negotiations. The European Union, for all its good efforts,
                    is still not cohesive or organized or fast enough to be able to stand up to the
                    Russians when it becomes necessary. At the same time, I think it is true that
                    none of these conflicts can be resolved without Russian cooperation. Russia's
                    influence in this part of the world is just too great and likely to remain so.
                    In the case of Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russia is in fact the
                    key factor that perpetuates the conflicts. In the case of Karabakh, the Russians
                    cannot force a settlement but they can be spoilers and prevent one if they
                    choose to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense that Russia was becoming more adversarial
                        and hardline in its policies? Were people starting to become more worried
                        about Russian policies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>PERINA: We spent a huge amount of time trying to figure out Russian policy and
                    what they were really up to. It was very difficult because the policies were so
                    often seemingly inconsistent and contradictory. The Russians would say one thing
                    and act completely differently. Part of this, of course, might be attributed to
                    basic duplicity, and I am sure it was, but it was also more complicated. The
                    Presidents in the region such as Voronin and Shevardnadze all complained to me
                    about their frustrations with the Russians. Voronin in particular would tell me
                    how Putin promised him something but then it never happened. I once asked
                    Trubnikov, the Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister whom I got to know well
                    through the Karabakh negotiations, why this was so. He answered “Well, you know,
                    Putin can decide something but then by the time it works its way through the
                    bureaucracy, it can come out looking very different.” It occurred to me then
                    that part of the problem was that all of us who were trained as Sovietologists
                    were in part still looking at Russia from that perspective. We assumed
                    decision-making was centralized, coordinated and controlled, as in the days when
                    all power was concentrated in the Kremlin. In fact, many things in Russia had
                    turned 180 degrees. Russia was more chaotic, uncoordinated, and decentralized
                    than we imagined. There were new factors such as bureaucratic resistance,
                    political and economic rivalries, and corruption that were playing out in very
                    different ways from how things had worked in the Soviet period. I think that was
                    a big part of the challenge in understanding Russia at this time. Now I would
                    say that since this period, the pendulum has again started to swing, and we do
                    see more of a Soviet pattern emerging in Russia. Certainly, Putin has gotten
                    much stronger than he was five years ago and stronger than many people expected.
                    But Russia remains very different from the Soviet Union, and that has made its
                    policies much more difficult to understand and predict.</p>
                <p>But let me make on last point here about Russian policy. Even though I believe
                    the Russians are responsible for perpetuating three out of four of these
                    conflicts that I worked on, I think it is still remarkable how relatively few
                    conflicts emerged from the break-up of an enormous empire like the Soviet Union.
                    Imagine if the Soviet Union had split apart in the same manner that Yugoslavia
                    did—what a bloody scene that would have been. It could have happened but it did
                    not. Overall, the Soviet break-up was remarkably peaceful and civilized,
                    certainly when compared to the Yugoslav experience. I think the leaders of the
                    time, Gorbachev and Yeltsin, and also the Russian people, deserve credit for
                    this. There are not many empires in history that allow themselves peacefully to
                    disintegrate. We are all lucky that by and large the Soviet Union did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do in 2004?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: In 2004 I went to my last assignment as Deputy Director of the Policy
                    Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Policy Planning from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>PERINA: I was there from May 2004 until February 2006.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Policy Planning Staff when
                        you joined in 2004?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: When I joined I was not certain what to expect. The office had a
                    reputation as a prestigious place to work. This came in good part from its
                    history. It was established in the spring of 1947 by Secretary Marshall, and the
                    first Director was George Kennan. Kennan describes in his memoirs how he was
                    called to set up this small team of foreign policy experts but really had no
                    idea what their job should be. He requested a meeting with Marshall and asked
                    him what the staff should do. Marshall replied with two words: “Avoid trivia.”
                    We had coffee cups in the office with those words on them. Kennan clearly
                    followed the advice because less than a month after this meeting, he presented
                    Marshall with the outline for a European recovery program that came to be known
                    as the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a tough act to follow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: It surely is, and not all subsequent Directors were as successful. Over
                    the years, the office has evolved into something between a think tank and a
                    small NSC staff for the Secretary of State. It really has two functions: first,
                    to come with up new ideas and policies, and secondly, to ensure policy
                    coordination within the Department. That is why almost all substantive memos and
                    papers by bureaus have to be cleared with the staff. The staff is
                    organizationally a part of the Secretary's office and is traditionally headed by
                    an outsider, a political appointee, and not a career State Department person.
                    Because the position is considered to be on the personal staff of the Secretary,
                    the Director does not have to be confirmed by the Senate. There are usually two
                    deputies, one a career person and the other from outside. I was the career one.
                    Then there are usually about twenty or so members of the staff who cover the
                    world. There is usually an expert for each of the major geographic regions, as
                    well as experts in functional areas like global economics, arms control, foreign
                    assistance and so on. Compared to other offices in the Department, it is thus a
                    very small and compact operation. The members usually are very smart people from
                    a variety of backgrounds. I would say that in my time about half the staff came
                    from universities and think tanks outside of government, a quarter was from
                    non-State Department agencies like the CIA and the Pentagon, and another quarter
                    came from inside the Department. The office also included the Secretary's
                    speechwriters. It was a very good and stimulating mix of people. It was also
                    interesting because as members of the Secretary's office we got to see almost
                    everything—all the memos, all the intelligence reports and so on, both incoming
                    and outgoing. We even saw the memoranda of conversation or Memcons as they are
                    called of the President's meetings and phone calls with other leaders. These are
                    normally very tightly held.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>PERINA: In a bureaucratic way the office always is simply because other offices
                    have to clear their papers with the staff. But if you mean influential on really
                    major foreign policy decisions, then that is a mixed picture. A few years back,
                    one former member of the staff did a very informal historical study of its
                    influence. He concluded that it depends almost entirely on the relationship
                    between the Secretary and the Policy Planning Staff Director. In other words,
                    the staff is a tool for the Secretary to use. Some Secretaries choose to use it
                    more, and some choose to use it less. That determines how much influence it
                    has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you judge the influence of the staff while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: When I got there in 2004 Colin Powell was Secretary of State. The
                    Director of Policy Planning was a fellow named Mitchell Reiss, a professor of
                    law and government at William and Mary College. Colin Powell, whom I admire
                    greatly and thus do not want this to be understood in a negative way, was more
                    of an operational person than a strategic, theoretical thinker. He was
                    respectful of Policy Planning Staff papers that we sent him but he rarely
                    elicited them. His strength was in operations and management, where he was
                    probably the best Secretary I have worked for. The second Director of Policy
                    Planning during my time there was Stephen Krasner, a professor of international
                    relations at Stanford who came in with Condi Rice. He was a very serious,
                    critical thinker. But Condi Rice focused strongly on only a few major policy
                    issues, such as Iraq and the Middle East, on which the whole government was
                    focused. She saw the Policy Planning Staff more as an office for special
                    projects. She assigned Steve Krasner the task of preparing a study of the U.S.
                    foreign assistance apparatus, to which he devoted a lot of effort. He also
                    traveled quite a bit which kept him out of the office. So I would say that the
                    influence of the staff in my time was mixed and probably about average.</p>

                <p>PERINA: The invasion of Iraq came while I was still Special Negotiator and before
                    I joined the Policy Planning Staff. While I wasn't working on Iraq at that time,
                    I do recall thinking how strange it seemed that within the State Department
                    there was so little debate on the decision to invade. The tipping point came
                    imperceptibly, and suddenly everyone just assumed we would invade. It was almost
                    a given. I think in retrospect that one of the reasons for this was that there
                    had been so little debate about the Afghanistan invasion also, and it appeared
                    to have been successful. So everyone somehow hoped that it would be the same
                    with Iraq and did not want to question policies that seemed to be working. By
                    the time I came to the Policy Planning Staff, about a year after the invasion,
                    the situation was already very different. Everybody was recognizing that things
                    were not going as planned and that there was a problem. Even the political
                    appointees on the staff, who were obviously strong supporters of the
                    Administration, admitted this. So yes, people were worried but no one on the
                    staff had any brilliant ideas on how to fix the situation. We really only had
                    one person working directly on Iraq and about four out of the 20 staff members
                    working on the broader Middle East region. It was difficult to second guess the
                    hundreds of people who by then were in Baghdad or elsewhere closer to the issue.
                    We focused more on the broader issue of dealing with failing and renegade states
                    through what Condi Rice called transformational diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: A lot of people think that transformational diplomacy is just a fancy
                    term for something that has always been on the foreign policy agenda, and they
                    are basically right. On the other hand, giving something a new formulation is
                    sometimes a legitimate way of giving it policy focus and priority. I think that
                    is what Condi Rice was trying to do. I once asked Steve Krasner where the term
                    transformational diplomacy came from. He said he thought it was coined by Condi
                    Rice herself. I always thought that unlikely but really do not know the origins
                    of the term. Perhaps it did come from Condi Rice. The term had different
                    interpretations but they all stemmed from the notion that in the post-Cold War
                    world weak and failing states were the chief threat to regional stability. I
                    always interpreted transformational diplomacy as the process of developing tools
                    to transform such failing states into successful ones through promotion of
                    economic development, good governance and so on. In its broadest interpretation,
                    however, transformational diplomacy could also encompass very interventionist
                    policies in the internal affairs of states. This always seemed to me
                    uncomfortably close to an ideological justification of the policies that got us
                    into Iraq. But the idea that transformation of dysfunctional states into
                    successful states is a very high priority in today's world is, I think,
                    legitimate, and it is certainly a different priority from the one we had in the
                    Cold War when we supported states just because they were on our side and not
                    Moscow's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in policy planning did you pick up on the
                        tensions between the State Department and the Defense Department under
                        Donald Rumsfeld?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>PERINA: Yes, the fact of these tensions was no secret. They were evident on many
                    levels, starting with the relations between Rumsfeld and Colin Powell. I saw
                    some of the memos between the two of them, and there was no love lost. One area
                    where policy tensions were very evident was on the issue of who would be
                    responsible for the administration of Iraq after we occupied it. Initially, the
                    Defense Department took the lead on this and angered many in the State
                    Department, who felt that State should be in charge. The Defense Department soon
                    saw that this was going to be tougher than anticipated and decided it really
                    didn't want the job. At the same time, State recognized it lacked both resources
                    and personnel for such a huge undertaking. The truth is no one in the U.S.
                    Government, neither DOD nor State, was adequately prepared to take on this task.
                    Let me go back to one illustrative anecdote on this. In about March 2003, while
                    I was still Special Negotiator, I received a call from the office of Marc
                    Grossman, the Undersecretary for Political Affairs, asking if I would be
                    interested in going to Iraq to work with Jay Garner, the retired general who
                    took over as the first administrator of Iraq after the invasion. I said
                    emphatically that I would not be because I was very happy with the Special
                    Negotiator job and had no interest in leaving. But I was astounded that I would
                    even be considered for such a position since I knew nothing about Iraq and that
                    part of the world and had neither served nor even visited there. I had
                    absolutely no expertise for such a job but the Department was just trying on
                    short notice to find available people with Ambassadorial rank to fill the slots
                    it had agreed to fill on Garner's staff. This is an illustration of how prepared
                    the Department was to take on the nation-building of Iraq.</p>
                <p>This experience did, however, lead to one of the Department's initiatives during
                    my time on the Policy Planning Staff and that is the creation of the Office of
                    Reconstruction and Stabilization. This office was created in order to ensure
                    that in the future the Department would be capable of taking on reconstruction
                    and stabilization of post-conflict states and not be caught flat-footed as it
                    was after Iraq. It was also hoped that the creation of the office within the
                    State Department would settle the issue of which agency had the lead in such
                    instances. The idea as originally conceived was that there would be a
                    coordinator and a small staff of about a dozen people who would compile action
                    plans and lists of experts—including those outside the government—who could be
                    called up on short notice to help with the many specialized tasks of
                    post-conflict reconstruction, things like providing humanitarian assistance,
                    training police, establishing civil authority and so on. The Office of
                    Reconstruction and Stabilization itself was not intended to take on these tasks
                    but rather to have a surge capacity of finding the right people to do them on
                    short notice. The problem was that the Department recruited a coordinator for
                    the office who had a much more ambitious concept of it. He started recruiting a
                    staff not just for potential future conflicts but rather for almost all ongoing
                    conflicts in every geographic region. This was naturally resisted by many of the
                    regional bureaus in the Department and started some real bureaucratic battles.
                    It also soon outstripped the resources allocated to the project. This original
                    coordinator soon left and a more modestly functioning office now exists. It is,
                    I think, a useful innovation and a concrete example of the kinds of ideas we
                    tried to come up with under the rubric of transformational diplomacy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any of your experience with conflicts in the
                        Balkans and the Caucasus useful to you on the Policy Planning Staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I think that to some degree it was. From the experience of implementing
                    the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia, I at least knew the key elements that had to be
                    included in a reconstruction and stabilization effort. But we faced a much
                    deeper cultural divide in dealing with Muslim and Middle Eastern countries, and
                    the scale of the effort was another order of magnitude. What we most lacked were
                    not experts on conflicts but rather experts on the Muslim world. There was a
                    great shortage of such expertise in the Department. The other Deputy Director on
                    the Policy Planning Staff was, like me, also a Europeanist by background. We all
                    tried our best to refocus on issues like democratization of the Muslim world,
                    which was a high priority. I did learn quite a bit but would still not consider
                    myself an expert.</p>
                <p>In October 2004 I went on a trip to sub-Saharan Africa with our resident Africa
                    expert, Makila James. We visited Ethiopia and South Africa, though a planned
                    stopover in Nigeria had to be cancelled because of labor unrest in the country.
                    The trip had a twofold purpose. First we wanted to start annual policy planning
                    consultations with the African Union. This was successful, and the following
                    year we hosted an African Union delegation in Washington for the first such
                    meeting. The second objective of our trip was to look at developments in the
                    Muslim communities of sub-Saharan Africa. This was a bit of shock. African
                    Muslim communities were generally considered rather moderate but we found
                    rapidly-growing radicalization, often through the madrassas or Muslim schools
                    staffed by teachers from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. In Johannesburg, the
                    editor of a Muslim newspaper who invited us for a meeting in his office almost
                    got into a fistfight when one of his colleagues objected violently to our
                    presence. On our return, we wrote a memo to Colin Powell about the
                    radicalization of African Islam. It went into the larger effort of trying to
                    improve U.S. public diplomacy in the Muslim world, which was another very
                    frustrating endeavor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>PERINA: Well because it was such a difficult task and because people just did not
                    want to recognize the obvious—that much of the anti-American feeling in the
                    Muslim world and elsewhere was a direct result of our policies in the Middle
                    East, and especially Iraq. Not many people were willing to say that even though
                    I think many recognized it. The Deputy Secretary, Richard Armitage, was among
                    those who did recognize this and dared to say it but there were not many like
                    him. Particularly irritating was when some people in the Administration tried to
                    find easy answers by blaming anti-Americanism on the alleged failures of the
                    Foreign Service and career diplomats. The argument was that the culture of the
                    Foreign Service did not value public diplomacy, and that ambassadors spent too
                    little time on it. At one time, there was a big exercise to find ways of
                    motivating our diplomats to give more public speeches and interviews. Now there
                    is an element of truth in public diplomacy not traditionally being a big factor
                    in career advancement in the Foreign Service, and also in saying that most U.S.
                    embassies should probably do more in this area. But to think that getting more
                    speeches out of ambassadors was the answer to anti-Americanism in the world was
                    na�ve and allowed people to downplay the role of policy as a problem.</p>

                        effectiveness of Colin Powell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: I am perhaps not objective here because I had already worked with Colin
                    Powell on the National Security Council in 1987-89, and I really admired him. I
                    think he was very popular in the State Department as an excellent manager of
                    people. He did a lot for the institution, and people sensed that and appreciated
                    it. It was in stark contrast to the feelings in this regard toward his
                    predecessor and successor. But in terms of policy, I think it was recognized,
                    and he would recognize himself, that he was not as influential as he or others
                    would have hoped. He was generally outflanked on policy issues by Rumsfeld and
                    Cheney, and Condi Rice as NSC advisor was not of much help to him. I sensed that
                    he was never fully comfortable in the job of Secretary of State, and he was
                    never accepted into the real inner team in the White House. The real tragedy, of
                    course, was his UN speech prior to the Iraq invasion which in retrospect truly
                    damaged his reputation. I think his years in the State Department were very
                    difficult ones for him.</p>

                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>PERINA: It was a difficult transition, and not a particularly friendly one. You
                    can see it beginning with the way Colin Powell was dismissed. He resigned, of
                    course, and he did not want to stay on. But the announcement came almost like a
                    dismissal. It was basically a White House press release. No public statement by
                    the President, no Rose Garden farewell. It was quite extraordinary for a
                    departing Secretary of State to get so little recognition. It reflected the fact
                    that Colin Powell had fallen out of favor in the White House. Some of the
                    political appointees on the Policy Planning Staff told me how Colin was viewed
                    as basically unsupportive of the President's policies and how he was suspected
                    of leaking information to the press that distanced him from these policies. He
                    was even criticized by some of not doing enough to counter anti-Americanism
                    abroad because he did not travel enough to defend U.S. policies overseas. Of
                    course, it was not just Colin Powell but the entire State Department, and
                    particularly the Foreign Service, which was seen as unsupportive of White House
                    policies. This has been the complaint of many administrations but I think the
                    distrust was especially bad at this time. So when Condi Rice was announced as
                    Powell's successor, the suspicion immediately surfaced that she was coming to
                    clean up the State Department and get it under control. Her arrival did not
                    dispel this. Senior career officers who were most closely identified with Powell
                    did not fare well. A large number retired. They were replaced by people she
                    brought in, primarily from the NSC or her Stanford days. All of this, of course,
                    is the prerogative of the Secretary of State, and most do want their own team.
                    But there was an exceptional tension in this transition.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what degree did Iraq dominate the foreign policy
                        agenda? How much attention was given to other issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: By the time I arrived, the Policy Planning Staff paid more attention to
                    other issues simply because there were so many people elsewhere working Iraq
                    that there was not very much our small office could contribute. But for the
                    Department and the government as a whole, Iraq was the gorilla in the room. That
                    was the main focus of U.S. policy, particularly as the insurgency grew. Beyond
                    Iraq, there were the broader issues of the Middle East and the Muslim world. The
                    Policy Planning Staff did work on these issues, particularly in developing ideas
                    on how to promote reform, democracy and economic development in Muslim
                    countries. After these big issues came some secondary issues such as Iran, North
                    Korea, Venezuela and so on. They were on the radar screen of the Department
                    principles, though not consistently. After that, however, most issues were
                    worked at fairly low levels in the State Department. There were exceptions, of
                    course. Colin Powell took a lot of interest in Darfur and tried to do something
                    about it. He was the first major leader to call what was happening there
                    genocide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Policy Planning Staff work on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>PERINA: We did. Our Africa expert, Makila James, did a lot of work on it. It was
                    a very complicated situation, with roots in Sudan's civil war and also in
                    deep-seated ethnic enmity. The only way to stop the killing quickly would have
                    been to put in some sort of peacekeeping force but nobody was up to that. The
                    U.S. was bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Europeans played with the idea
                    but backed away when they saw the commitment required, the African Union claimed
                    to want to do it but completely lacked resources. Thus people focused on
                    diplomatic efforts which were very frustrating and manipulated by the Sudanese
                    Government. People in the West understood the enormity of the tragedy— over two
                    million displaced people and hundreds of thousands, perhaps half a million,
                    killed. But many people did not understand the enormity of the task. Many
                    imagine a small region like Kosovo but in fact Darfur is about the size of
                    France, with almost no infrastructure. Policing a region like that is a real
                    challenge, and the international community's efforts in the political arena
                    basically failed. Those who really do deserve a lot of credit are the
                    humanitarian organizations, both governmental and non-governmental, who
                    delivered the food and relief supplies to keep so many of the displaced alive.
                    They are the unsung heroes of the international community. I found much the same
                    thing in Yugoslavia. The UN was rightly criticized for its political failure in
                    dealing with the Bosnian war but UN humanitarian relief agencies did a very good
                    job in helping the civilian population survive the conflict. They deserve a lot
                    of credit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much attention on the planning staff paid to
                        Europe in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>PERINA: Relations with Europe were not good in this period. It was actually the
                    worst period in transatlantic relations that I saw during my entire career.
                    Given the amount of sympathy and support we received from the Europeans right
                    after 9/11, the reversal in the relationship was dramatic. The parting of ways,
                    of course, came with Iraq. The Western Europeans were angry at us for invading
                    without a Security Council resolution, and the Administration here was furious
                    at the Western Europeans, and particularly France, for frustrating efforts to
                    get a resolution. This anger at France was picked up by the whole country, with
                    the Freedom Fries and so on. It was a real low point in our relations with
                    Europe. The exceptions were the UK and the new democracies of Central and
                    Eastern Europe—the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Romanians and so on, the New
                    Europe as opposed to the Old Europe in Donald Rumsfeld's lexicon. The
                    relationship with the UK reflected the very close Bush-Blair relationship. There
                    seemed to be a real personal friendship between the two men. They spoke
                    frequently on the telephone, often at length and in great detail about Iraq and
                    world developments. As for Eastern and Central Europe, we were still popular
                    there thanks to the legacy of the Cold War and our image as the power that stood
                    up against Soviet despotism. Even in those years, however, one could see this
                    goodwill toward America dissipating as these countries began to have their own
                    doubts about Iraq and started maneuvering for EU membership. The Policy Planning
                    Staff still had its established contacts and consultations with our European
                    counterparts but the broader relationship was very cold. Interestingly, this did
                    not seem to bother many in the Administration. Europe was seen as an economic
                    partner but not a real political force in the world. The analyses were all that
                    it would become weaker and less relevant to U.S. security interests. Russia
                    sparked some concern, but it was also seen as weak and non-threatening. Not a
                    lot of attention seemed to be paid to it by senior Administration officials. The
                    real new power on the horizon was China. It received a good deal of
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: China was seen as the economic giant who was the main rival of the U.S.
                    for global resources and whose political development had not kept pace with its
                    economic development. There was a lot of concern for a certain period about
                    Chinese-Taiwanese relations. The Taiwanese were seen as unpredictable, and the
                    Chinese were seen as having a rather unrefined, undeveloped policy toward the
                    island. The real nightmare scenario was a conflict breaking out between them
                    which would put pressure on the U.S. to intervene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Iran? Was there any support for trying to open
                        a dialogue with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>PERINA: I was not aware of any during my time on the Planning Staff. I heard that
                    there had been some attempts through diplomatic channels during the Powell years
                    but that the Iranians had shown no interest. There was a feeling among the
                    experts that the internal political situation in Iran would make it very
                    difficult for any leader to admit to a dialogue with the United States. The
                    Iranians were not ready for that. The Administration also still held to a tough
                    line on the axis of evil countries. Being tough was seen as the way to go. On
                    the nuclear issue, the Europeans stepped in and tried to start a dialogue. We
                    did not object to this because it took away pressure from the U.S. to talk to
                    Iran and showed the Europeans what tough going it was. We did not think the EU
                    effort would succeed and were irritated that the Europeans did not see that
                    themselves but did we not try to stop them.</p>
                <p>I had some contact with Iranians when I was Special Negotiator. There was a
                    tradition for the Minsk Group Co-Chairs from time to time to brief the Iranians
                    on the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations as a courtesy, since Iran was
                    a neighboring country to the conflict. The Iranians asked for such a briefing
                    shortly after President Bush's “axis of evil” speech, perhaps as a test of
                    whether the U.S. would still have contact with them. I had to get permission
                    directly from Colin Powell for the briefing but he concurred. The French
                    Co-Chair organized the meeting in Paris. It lasted about an hour and dealt
                    strictly with Nagorno-Karabakh and nothing else so it really did not qualify as
                    any sort of dialogue in a political sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the influence on foreign policy
                        of Vice President Cheney and his office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERINA: Not really. I was not involved in any deliberations at that level. I
                    certainly knew the conventional wisdom in Washington that the Vice President was
                    very powerful. What I did see was that members of his staff participated at more
                    interagency meetings than I had ever seen with previous vice presidents. I also
                    know that their views were taken very seriously in the clearance process. This
                    was in some contrast to staff members of the National Security Council. In fact,
                    within the bureaucracy the NSC was considered a relatively weak institution
                    compared to its role in other administrations. Many of the people were junior
                    and did not seek to exert much influence. It is interesting how these power
                    relationships of institutions transfer down to relationships between people on
                    tasks like drafting memos.</p>

                <p>PERINA: I retired on April 30, 2006 after almost 32 years in the Foreign Service.
                    I did subsequently take on some short-term assignments as a retiree, including a
                    two-month stint as Charg� d'Affaires in our Embassy in Chisinau and a four-month
                    stint as the Charg� in the Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia. The family links also
                    continued because three months before my retirement my younger daughter,
                    Alexandra, joined the State Department as an attorney in the Legal Adviser's
                    Office. She wanted to work in the State Department, which I think says something
                    good about my career there, at least as perceived by my family.</p>
