                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add as a footnote here that Dick Parker has been
                        my boss for the last almost a year now as he has been president for the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies. So he is familiar with the process, and
                        I finally have the chance to get him into a corner and interview him now
                        that he is leaving his post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dick, how did you become interested in foreign affairs?</p>
                <p>PARKER: I had wanted to go to West Point and couldn't pass the physical, and I
                    went instead to Kansas State to study engineering. Not terribly happy about
                    being an engineer, but not knowing exactly what I wanted to do. In the summer of
                    1941, a young man named Richard Ericson, subsequently the ambassador to Iceland,
                    with whom I had gone to high school with in Leavenworth, Kansas, came by. He was
                    working for Philip Morris. They were going to Army posts and passing out Philip
                    Morris free samples in chow lines. He had made up his mind. He also is another
                    Army boy. He had wanted to go to West Point, and he couldn't pass the physical.
                    He decided he would go into the Foreign Service. And he told me about it. It was
                    the first time I had ever heard of it. I understood from him that one had to go
                    Georgetown to get in. I made up my mind that at some point I would try it, that
                    it sounded like it might be interesting.</p>
                <p>Then the war came along. I started as an infantry officer, and I was a prisoner
                    of war in Germany. I saw the destruction of World War II and the misery. For two
                    months, I was what was, technically, a displaced person myself, wandering around
                    Poland trying to get out.</p>
                <p>I resolved that I was going to go back and try to do something about this with
                    one part of my mind. With the other part of my mind, I was still hoping to stay
                    in the Army. As it turned out, the Army didn't take me. I took the written
                    examination in 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Foreign Service written examination.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PARKER: The Foreign Service written examination in 1946 and very much to my
                    surprise, passed it. I took the oral in '47 and flunked it. They told me to go
                    to school for another year because I didn't know anything about economics or
                    American history.</p>
                <p>I then entered Foreign Service forty years ago, in 1949. In fact, today is the
                    fortieth reunion of my entering FSO class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give maybe a little description of what the
                        background and the attitudes of the group you came in with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we had all been in one of the services during the war. Most of us,
                    I believe, had the same experience. We had taken the written in 1946, had passed
                    it, and then had flunked the oral because we had to finish school, or the board
                    thought we were deficient in some respect. They had given us a grade high enough
                    so that we could go back to school for a year and then come back and take the
                    oral again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without having to take the—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Without having to take the written again. We were, I don't know, I was
                    twenty-five. I was one of the younger members of the class. I think the youngest
                    member was twenty-three.</p>
                <p>We all, I think—well, it's interesting. We were discussing this the other day,
                    and I find one member of the class, Bob Brewster said that he had always wanted
                    to join the Foreign Service, and he had never thought of anything else. In my
                    case, I looked on this as a possibility. By this time, I had become interested
                    in languages. I had spent a lot of time on studying German. I had a choice at
                    one point. I had to make a choice between an academic career and Foreign
                    Service. I thought I would try the Foreign Service for two years and see what it
                    was like. And if I didn't like it, I would go back into academia. But I went in
                    and enjoyed it and stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking on this, the military service experience was
                        something that I think almost all the people coming into the post-World War
                        Foreign Service shared because it was predominantly male and until the
                        cutoff of the draft really after the Vietnam War, you could count on this
                        pretty much. Did you find that your military experience changed, warped, or
                        did anything to you and to your fellow Foreign Service Officers that might
                        not happen to people coming in later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, certainly I think in my case, my military experience was a
                    formative experience in my life. Certainly, it changed me in many ways. The most
                    important thing it did for me was that I learned from it that I could do almost
                    anything, within reason, that I set my mind to. I had a great variety of jobs
                    and responsibilities. I had been able to cope more or less successfully with all
                    of them. It had given me a greatly increased self-confidence. It did not really
                    prepare me for any aspect of the Foreign Service. I haven't found my military
                    experience particularly useful except in times of stress or when making
                    observations about political military situations. But I never felt the need to
                    go to War College, for instance, to learn how the military thought. I thought I
                    already knew that. I think that was a useful element in someone's
                    background.</p>
                <p>I think I should add to that there is an element of leadership involved here. You
                    have experience in ordering large numbers of people around. And I think this
                    comes in very useful when you have positions of executive responsibility in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, to get a little idea, you had a board
                        looking at your whole group and most of you had been sent back to get a
                        year's academic training. Do you think this is the board being a bit
                        precious representing the old Foreign Service and didn't really like what
                        they saw the raw material coming out and needing a little polishing, or do
                        you think this is really justified?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I think it was very justified in my case. I didn't know anything. I
                    mean, I had studied engineering, chemistry, and physical chemistry, and organic
                    chemistry, and mathematics. My career in college had been interrupted at the end
                    of my junior year. I had managed to get in the study of some German and some
                    Spanish and public speaking, but that was about all I'd had that was relevant to
                    the Foreign Service. I am forever grateful for them sending me back for that
                    year because I put it to very good use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was to Sydney, Australia. I'd like
                        just a quick snapshot, how did you feel at your first Foreign Service post?
                        I mean, how did this hit you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, Sydney, I was considered very fortunate to get Sydney. Originally,
                    I was assigned to Seoul. They changed that because we had a small child. This is
                    in 1949. And sent us to Sydney instead. We were very pleased about that.</p>
                <p>We found the post was a medium-sized consulate general run by a named Orson
                    Nielsen, whose first post had been St. Petersburg before World War I. An
                    old-fashioned, what we used to call old-line Foreign Service Officer, who was
                    very particular about his scotch and thought of himself as a connoisseur of wine
                    and so forth. Very frosty. Actually, I had no idea that he had any opinion at
                    all of me, but he apparently saw possibilities in me. He was very good to
                    me.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We had a couple of bizarre people there. I had a very bizarre officer in charge
                    of me. I won't mention his name. He is still alive. He is somebody who was
                    terrible rude to everybody including visitors to the consulate. He had sold a
                    Cadillac for an enormous amount of money and had it converted into gold seal,
                    yellow seal, dollar bills which he housed in a big Gladstone bag which he kept
                    in a safe behind my desk. Every month, he would come and count this money
                    because he was expecting World War III to break out at any moment, and he wanted
                    to be sure that he had enough cash to handle the situation. He must have had, I
                    don't know, $15,000 back there in back of my desk. An enormous amount of
                    money.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to—first of all, we didn't call them that in those days—I was the
                    general services officer. I did the pouches and files and liquor orders and got
                    hot water heaters for the people in Canberra and so forth. Essentially
                    administrative work. Then I was rotated to consular work and commercial work. I
                    found it a very useful, very valuable experience.</p>
                <p>The consul general, the crusty old consul general, left mid-way through our tour.
                    We got a new name who was rather a S.O.B. and brought another S.O.B. with him as
                    a hatchet man. The place deteriorated after that, and I was glad to leave.</p>
                <p>I went from there to Jerusalem where I was the number two man in the small
                    consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1951.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: 1951. I had decided that I was going to be stuck in consular and
                    administrative work all my career unless I developed a specialty. We looked
                    around. The obvious thing to do was—I knew I had a language aptitude—to choose a
                    language, a hard language. My first choice would have been Russian or Japanese
                    because I had served in Japan in the Army after the war, but they were both
                    full. I looked at the others, and I decided that Arabic offered the most
                    possibilities. I had had a very brief glimpse of the Arab world coming out of
                    Europe in 1945 and stopping at Port Said. So I thought either Arabic or Turkish.
                    I had written to the Department saying that I would like to specialize in one of
                    those languages. I didn't know which. I would like a tour in the area to make up
                    my mind. So they sent us to Jerusalem, which was a great post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at a little at the decision making process, was
                        the idea at this point that if you really wanted to get ahead—you were
                        hearing this from other officers and all— that a hard language is the way to
                        do it, and Russian is number one, and Japanese number two, and then
                        something else after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. The real road to glory was with being in Europe, but it was
                    allegedly very hard to get to Europe, to get into EUR. You had to have something
                    to offer. Russian certainly was the leading language.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the days of George Kennan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: George Kennan and so forth. This was all very exclusive, sort of ivy
                    league and University of Chicago people. Somebody like me coming from the
                    outback would have no chance breaking into that charmed circle. I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this has helped in a way turn you towards another
                        language. Some of the hard languages for what could be called in the old
                        colonial terms, for other ranks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I had no idea really what the possibilities of Arabic were. At this
                    point, the Middle East was still something of a backwater. Actually, I was
                    primarily interested in North Africa which sounded like the most fun. I was
                    interested in a place which had posts that were not too uncomfortable and which
                    offered a range of possibilities.</p>
                <p>I didn't want to study a language which was confined to one country. This
                    obviously offered opportunities, but I had no idea of what the scale of those
                    opportunities would be at that point in time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And nobody was particularly spelling this out for—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: —for officers. I mean, this is something you sort of have
                        to learn in the corridors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Right. The Department did and does, I'm sure, continues to do and always
                    will do, an absolutely terrible job in this respect. People in the language
                    services are mostly non-career people anyway. They don't have any concept of the
                    career implications of this. My experience is that you learn these things on the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, now, you went to Jerusalem in 1951. How did you
                        see the situation at the time in Jerusalem and in the Arab world? How did it
                        appear to you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>PARKER: I didn't have any idea of what it was. I had gone to see the Israeli
                    consul in Sydney who recommended some books to me. I read several of these
                    books. One of them was Arthur Koestler's Promise and Fulfillment. There was also
                    a Lebanese consul there. But a man who for various reasons, principally his
                    rather poor command of English, was not taken seriously by anybody. I did not go
                    to see him. It never occurred to me.</p>
                <p>I went to Jerusalem primarily with an Israeli-oriented background. I had no idea
                    of the complications of the Palestine problem or anything else, or the history
                    of our involvement in that area, or what our interests were. I was interested in
                    my career and going to serve in a place that might be interesting and would have
                    some prospect of maybe leading me to the exalted rank of class 3 or class 2 by
                    the time I was ready to retire.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it fit into the system because Jerusalem has

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well, we reported directly to the Department, and we were very
                    jealous of our independent status. We didn't take any nonsense from those
                    bastards in Tel Aviv or Amman. We thought they didn't really understand the
                    situation. The principal officer, the consul general, was in charge of political
                    reporting, and we had primary responsibility for reporting on the activities of
                    the mixed armistice commissions, which were the U.N.-supervised commissions
                    which had both Israeli and Arab officers on them which were supervising the
                    armistice agreements concluded in 1949. There were always incidents across the
                    border to report on. A lot of activity, very interesting activity.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, they were the borders where the fighting stopped in '48. Jerusalem
                    was a divided city. We had an office on the Arab side, and an office on the
                    Israeli side. The first six months of our tour there, we lived on the Israeli
                    side. And the remaining eighteen months, we were on the Arab side. We had to go
                    back and forth. We had a sort of permanent pass that would let us go back and
                    forth through the Mandelbaum gate.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>One of my principal functions was arranging temporary passes for people to go
                    through the gates. To go from the Israel side to the Arab side and vice versa.
                    These were tourists, officials, visitors, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, who was the consul general and how did he operate in
                        this complicated situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The consul general was a man named Tyler, Roger B. Tyler. No, sorry. S.
                    Roger Tyler. He operated very well in this environment. He took things very much
                    in his stride, moving back and forth, knowing people on both sides of the
                    border. I think well-liked by people on both sides. He was a very poor
                    administrator of the consulate general. I had a terrible time with him. But he
                    was certainly, in terms of the political function, I think very good and quite
                    well-liked, and everybody remembers him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuation of my interview with Ambassador
                        Richard Parker. Today is April 25.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dick, you were saying you wanted to add something about dealing with—we talked
                    about the Mandelbaum gate—but your assignment in Jerusalem in 1951 to 1953 about
                    the West Bank?</p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Thinking over the answer I gave you afterwards, I thought I should
                    have pointed out that at this point in 1951, the West Bank, the region between
                    the Jordan River and the 1948 boundaries of Israel, was controlled by
                    Jordan.</p>
                <p>The consulate general in Jerusalem had responsibility for reporting on the West
                    Bank. People from Amman did not get over there very much. The Jordan River was
                    always quite a division between us. Actually, the West Bank was our consular
                    district. We didn't issue visas, but we did passport and citizenship and
                    notarial services for the West Bank. We also in theory had responsibility for
                    Gaza. In other words, we had responsibility for everything that was left over
                    from 1948: Gaza, the West Bank, and the so-called corpus separatum, the separate
                    body of Jerusalem. We didn't recognize the sovereignty of either Jordan or
                    Israel over their respective halves to that city. Tel Aviv did not send people
                    up to Jerusalem without our permission.</p>
                <p>Back in 1951, the Foreign Ministry was still down at the place called the
                    Village—I think it was Hakirya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PARKER: Israeli Foreign Ministry. We saw in the Foreign Service list that the
                    Department was showing Gaza as in our district. Nobody from Cairo had been there
                    since 1948, apparently. One day I decided to try to find out if we could
                    actually go to Gaza. We had special passes that permitted us to go across the
                    border in Jerusalem, up in Galilee on the Bridge of Jacob's Daughters between
                    Syria and Israel, and across the Lebanese border at Ras Naqurah. So why not go
                    to Gaza with a U.N. pass? So we applied for permission to go there, and it was
                    refused by the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>I don't know what the people in Gaza did, but certainly we were not providing any
                    consular services to them, nor were we reporting on that area nor was anybody
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of a lacuna there. To move on now, you in 1953 sort
                        of came a career choice and this is when you—we talked about going into
                        Arabic. How was the Arabic training set up at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the module was one year at the FSI in Washington, and one year at
                    the FSI school that was opened in Beirut in 1953. We were the second class to go
                    through this procedure. Harry Symmes was in the class ahead of us. My
                    recollection is that he did not go on to Beirut, he just took one year of
                    Arabic.</p>
                <p>I had been studying Arabic on my own in Jerusalem at my own expense with a local
                    tutor and had made some progress in the colloquial and a little bit of progress
                    with reading. I had anticipated completing two years in Jerusalem and then
                    perhaps going into Arabic training.</p>
                <p>I had been asked to comment on my interests in Arabic training, and had said I
                    had heard mixed views about the competence of the FSI in teaching this language,
                    but I was confident of my ability to learn it in spite of the FSI, if that
                    became necessary. I was pretty smart-assed. It was a famous letter in the FSI
                    when I got back there.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, out of the blue, after we had been in Jerusalem just eighteen months,
                    we got a telegram saying— this was in the beginning of March—”is Parker
                    interested in taking Arabic? There is a class starting March 1.” The class had
                    already started.</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes,” and left as soon as I could which was about two weeks leaving my
                    wife and family to pay, pack, and follow in the best traditions of the Service.
                    I came home two weeks late for the class, but I was still ahead of the other
                    people who were in it.</p>
                <p>It was a small class of five people, of whom four survived for the full two
                    years. Two of us were CIA, two of us were Department of State. I thought the
                    training was very good. I profited a lot from it. There were certain things I
                    would have done differently. I would have taught more classical Arabic and less
                    colloquial. But I came out of that course with, I think, an S-3 R-3 rating, but
                    it was—</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, S-3 R-3 means speaking and reading.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Knowledge. Good enough for work. Actually, it's not good enough. You have
                    to have an S-4 R-4 to be of any real utility in the Foreign Service. I
                    eventually got up to that level after having a refresher course.</p>
                <p>But I found it, as I say, I liked the FSI technique. The constant drills and rote
                    learning process which I think is the only way to learn that language, any
                    language, and it is still with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, then you went to Beirut to complete your
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The second year was in Beirut, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, how was that different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, it was not as tightly run as things were at the FSI in Beirut.
                    There, we were the minority, and the Lebanese and the other Arabs were the
                    majority. It was sort of hard to dragoon them into the kind of sweaty work you
                    really have to do for memorization. I mean, it was, well, relaxed. The problem
                    with Beirut is that everybody there speaks English. It was very difficult to get
                    Lebanese to speak Arabic to you unless you really spoke it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like you at this point to comment a bit—it's a
                        question I ask everybody who has concentrated in the Arab world—how you
                        viewed at that time and your colleagues, how they viewed the Arab world? Was
                        there a mind-set? Because this is often a statement made about all Arabists
                        feel so- and-so and all of this. Looking at it in the perspective of the
                        time, what kind of people were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we were young officers who were interesting in getting ahead in our
                    career, and we became interested in this area. It became for me an intellectual
                    interest, which has continued down to the present day.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>If you are going to operate in an area like this, if you are going to be
                    effective, you've got to have a certain empathy for the people in the area, some
                    understanding of them and an ability to relate to them. I think it is inevitable
                    that people who work in the Arab world or any other place, except possibly the
                    Soviet Union, where everybody is supposed to be our implacable enemy, where
                    there is some possibility of cultivating people and making friends, you tend to
                    make friends, and you tend to sympathize with their point of view. I know that
                    localitis is a problem throughout this area. We have had many officers who have
                    gotten thoroughly identified with the Arab point of view. I always tried to
                    maintain a perspective. I always thought of myself as taking a pro-American
                    point of view, and seeing that we had interests that were being sacrificed in
                    the Middle East because of our over-identification with Israel, an
                    over-identification which has become much stronger since 1967, and which has
                    prevented us from making decisions in many instances in the best interests of
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>I have known a few nuts—I mean, a few people who have gotten fanatic about it,
                    but most people I think have maintained a degree of balance. Bill Brewer used to
                    say that it was a mistake to think of the Arabists as being pro-Arab because
                    having to work with them and being frustrated by them, they were probably more
                    cynical about them than anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, my two and a half year exposure in Dhahran,
                        Saudi Arabia did not endear me to the machinations of that world. Why did we
                        not develop the equivalent—have you noticed—of Arabists, of Israelists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We have trained some people in Hebrew. There are a number of officers who
                    have spent two, or perhaps three, tours in Israel, but, you know, making a
                    career out of Israel is pretty limiting in terms of your choice of jobs and
                    places to go and so forth. Very little geographic scope. If you become an
                    Israeli specialist, you are hardly persona grata across the line in the Arab
                    countries. So it has not been something that has appealed a great deal to
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, turning to your first assignment in the Arab
                        world, you went to Amman from 1955 to 1956. Could you explain a little of
                        what your job was and what the situation was there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I was the political officer. That is, the political officer. We had a
                    one-man political section. Myself and two local employees who did the press
                    translation and functioned as general translators. We had one economic officer,
                    a DCM and ambassador. We had two secretaries and a code clerk in the pool in the
                    back of the building. We had a small CIA shop. And that was it. Plus a consular
                    section with one officer, and an administrative section with three officers. We
                    didn't really feel we were particularly short of staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>It turned out to be a very critical time in the history of Jordan. While we were
                    there, things erupted in a way not unlike what's happened this last week in
                    Jordan, with the demonstrations against the price increases imposed by the Prime
                    Minister. This was at the time of great Arab nationalist agitation. The leader
                    of which was Gamal Abdul Nasser in Egypt.</p>
                <p>The United States at the same time was pushing the Baghdad Pact, which started
                    out as the, I think, Iran-Turkey Pact. Then it was a Pakistan-Iran-Turkey Pact,
                    and then Iraq joined it. Well, Iraq joining it was regarded as an effort to
                    split the Arab world and to distract the Arabs from the real problem which was
                    Israel and try to realign them against the Soviets. This is a recurring theme in
                    our efforts in this area as seen by the Arabs. An attempt to distract the Arabs
                    from the real problem.</p>
                <p>This came at a time when King Hussein was still a very young man. He ascended the
                    throne in 1953 when he came of age, I think at age eighteen. In 1955, he was
                    twenty-one. He had just married his first wife. He was anxious to do something
                    about the state of his army which was then called the Arab Legion. It had been
                    British-formed and British- trained and British-financed. The British subsidy to
                    Jordan for the Arab Legion was ten million pounds sterling a year which is, you
                    know, absolutely nothing today.</p>
                <p>We did not belong to the Baghdad Pact, but the British did. They joined it. They
                    were anxious to get the Jordanians to come along in order to lessen Iraq's
                    isolation. They sent General Templar, who had been the hero of Malaya, to Amman.
                    He had subdued the leftist insurrection in Malaya. He came with an offer to the
                    king of something like equipping an armored brigade. The king was very tempted
                    by this. He was seriously considering joining the Baghdad pact.</p>
                <p>Well, the Egyptians got wind of this, and they got everybody agitated, and before
                    we knew it, people were out in the street rioting. We had two series of riots
                    about a month apart. Jordan almost came apart in the second series. The mobs
                    were down in the main streets of Amman about to start looting and breaking into
                    stores when the army finally intervened and stopped them.</p>
                <p>I think the king learned certain lessons from that that he's been applying
                    recently. And that is to respond quickly with overwhelming force when you've got
                    a civil disturbance.</p>
                <p>The follow-on to this was that Hussein sacked Glubb, the British brigadier, John
                    Bagot Glubb, who had been the organizer and the commander of the Arab Legion. He
                    sacked him, sent him off on twenty-four-hours notice. We all thought it was
                    ironic. Glubb was getting on the plane, and the Royal Chamberlain, Bahjat
                    Talhuni arrived, carrying a present from the king. It was an autographed
                    photograph in a silver frame. We thought, you know, he just sacked Glubb without
                    a pension or anything else, and he was going off into exile. We thought it was a
                    little cruel of the king to send him that picture.</p>

                <p>There followed a period of considerable political agitation, and then came the
                    Suez crisis. I didn't get to see the end of the Suez crisis because I came down
                    with hepatitis in July of '56. There was no decent doctor in Amman. The first
                    couple of weeks, nobody was able to diagnose me. Suddenly, we got a new doctor,
                    a Circassian, who had just been to medical school in the United States and
                    England, and was very competent. He diagnosed me. He was there for about two
                    weeks, and then was going off to a medical conference somewhere, and he said, “I
                    can't leave you here with all these quacks.” He shipped me off to Beirut to the
                    American University Hospital where I spent another month. My family, again,
                    joined me. We got on a ship and came home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate in Amman while you were there? I mean,
                        could you describe how one goes about getting the information for the
                        reporting that you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I don't know. Nobody ever told me how to do the political
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm asking you so you could—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I never had any—well, I am going to tell you—I never had any lessons or
                    exposure to this. In Jerusalem I had done a weekly press review which nobody
                    read. And I got to Amman. We had as an ambassador, Lester Mallory, who was an
                    old agricultural attach�, a very down to earth fellow, who had a good feeling
                    for the political atmosphere of third world countries. He pushed me out and made
                    me, you know, feel that he had confidence in me. And whatever I wanted to do was
                    all right with him, within reason.</p>
                <p>The requirements of the job, I think of any political officer job, almost
                    immediately impel you into a certain involvement with the government and the
                    people of the country in which you are located.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The first weekend I was there, we got a urgent telegram from the Department
                    regarding the Eric Johnston mission, which was the mission to develop the waters
                    of the Jordan River basin. This telegram had to be delivered to the Prime
                    Minister immediately, and there was nobody else in Amman but me. Everybody was
                    off somewhere. So I had the job of finding the Prime Minister, Said Pasha
                    al-Mufti, who recently died - to find him and deliver this message, which had
                    come in in telegram form, in English. And Said Pasha didn't speak any English.
                    So I called on him at his home and explained to him in Arabic that I had this
                    message to deliver. He sat me down on the porch, and I started going through it
                    in the colloquial which I had been taught. I got about three lines through it,
                    and was reading it quite competently, translating as I went. He stopped me and
                    said, “Wait a minute. That's too important for us to do it this way, i.e in
                    colloquial.” He brought his son out and had his son do the translating. Anyway,
                    from that point on, I had a friendship with the Said Pasha. I had entr�e to
                    him.</p>
                <p>There were similar things that came up all the time requiring you to go see the
                    governor, the mayor or somebody and ask him a specific question, “What are you
                    going to do about this or do you want that?” Or to go to the Foreign Ministry.
                    You also find yourself thrown into contact with the press.</p>
                <p>I think the most important thing you have to do is to be open to the idea of
                    contact. And be willing to sit and talk with anybody. Sometimes to suffer fools
                    gladly. Particularly in the third world, and the I think the rules are quite
                    different from what they are in Paris - but in the third world, to let people
                    realize that you are not looking down on them, that you are interested in them
                    and their culture and their language, and you are interested in what they have
                    to say, and you are open to their ideas. As soon as they feel that you are
                    talking down to them, they will shut up, and you won't hear anything from them.
                    But if you are sympathetic, I think you can get a lot out of people. And that
                    you have a much better understanding of what is going on in the country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we were interested in, first of all, the general question of
                    political attitudes, attitudes towards the king. We were interested in trying to
                    change perceptions of the United States and perceptions of our role in the
                    Baghdad Pact and so forth. We are always interested anywhere, I think, in any
                    country, in knowing what does the man on the street really think about the
                    government. What are the risks that something is going to happen to turn the
                    situation upside down.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where there any concerns about talking to Palestinian
                        leaders at that time, or were the Palestinians sort of an open group to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, in the first place, I would say at least fifty percent of the elite
                    in Amman were Palestinians even including the Prime Minister, Rifai. The Rifais,
                    including the Prime Minister who has just resigned, are Palestinians from
                    Safad.</p>
                <p>We had very good relations with the British. When I arrived there in 1955, the
                    British were running internal security. The chief of the internal security was a
                    British brigadier named Sir Patrick Coghill. He was one of the first people I
                    called on, and we had a very good liaison relationship with them. They didn't
                    mind our going to see anybody. There was no restriction from their point of view
                    on my seeing more radical people as long as they weren't in jail. The problem
                    was that these radicals really didn't want to be seen talking to the Americans.
                    That was rather difficult. The people I have in mind were all Palestinians with
                    one exception.</p>
                <p>I don't think I did a particularly good job of talking to those people. I had one
                    conversation with a man named Suleiman Nabulsi who was supposed to be the
                    leading nationalist in Amman. By his name, he comes from Nablus in Palestine.
                    Suleiman - I think we called him Suleiman Pasha— pasha was a Turkish title that
                    was held over and given to certain leading figures when they became Prime
                    Minister, and he had been Prime Minister once. Nabulsi turned out to be a very
                    weak character, but he was very personable. But I never got much out of him.</p>
                <p>And I never got much out of any other political figures. There were no political
                    parties in Amman. I could go and talk to the speaker of the parliament. I could
                    go and talk to any government official, but they would all give me the
                    government line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Nasser? I'm talking about you and the
                        embassy in Amman view Nasser, who was a major figure at that time in the
                        Arab world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I think we undoubtedly were influenced by the reporting from other
                    places such as Libya where it was perceived that Nasser was working away to
                    undermine American interests there. Certainly his attitude towards Baghdad and
                    the Baghdad Pact was very unhelpful. We had good personal relations with the
                    personnel of the Egyptian Embassy, but we had no illusions that their attitude
                    towards us was particularly benevolent. They saw themselves as engaged in a
                    struggle for the soul of Jordan.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And we saw the Egyptians, we saw Nasser, I think generally, as something of the
                    villain. A villain that was an honest villain. He was somebody that you could do
                    business with. You had to count your fingers carefully after you shook hands and
                    so forth, but it was somebody who represented an important and valid stream of
                    Arab nationalist thought and with whom we would have to get along whether we
                    liked it or not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, how about the Soviet Union? This is the height of the
                        Cold War and looking at it, again, from our embassy in Jordan, did the
                        Soviet Union and the threat of international communism play any role in our
                        concerns there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We were always concerned that social inequalities and the lack of
                    political freedoms would encourage communist agitation in Jordan. And there were
                    a few local communists who were apparently very hard core. The leaders were in
                    prison most of the time.</p>
                <p>My recollection is that the Soviets did not yet have an embassy in Amman at that
                    point. They were not major players on the board. There was no question of the
                    king getting arms from the Soviets. We didn't see the Soviets as somebody who
                    was at the door waiting to get in into Jordan. You must remember that until 1955
                    and the arms deal with Egypt, the Soviets had not really been involved in the
                    Middle East. It had not been an area of priority for them. They had looked with
                    great suspicion on Arab nationalist movements as being antithetical to
                    communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did you, again, from the Amman point of view, our
                        embassy, view Israel and how about, on a more personal side, how did you
                        view the reporting that was coming out of Tel Aviv? Did you feel you were
                        reporting on the same climate or was there a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Tel Aviv naturally tended to report things from an Israeli perspective.
                    That was the perspective that they saw down there. Just as I think we tended to
                    report things from a Jordanian perspective. We always thought they were terribly
                    pro-Israeli, and they always thought we were terribly pro-Arab.</p>
                <p>What was the first part of the question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Israel? One was the reporting and the
                        other was the—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I think we saw Israel as a considerable liability in the area. We
                    realized that it was no escaping our identification with it given the political
                    realities at that point. But we were concerned that this friend of ours was
                    something that was really out of control in terms of its activities towards its
                    neighbors. I arrived in Amman just after the Gaza raids in 1955 in which the
                    Israelis went over in force in Gaza and killed a large number of people,
                    attacking Egyptian police posts and so forth. A well-documented story and
                    something that Israelis are still arguing about and something that led directly
                    to the Egyptian press for arms from the Soviets. After the Gaza raid, they
                    turned to us for arms, and we imposed conditions which they thought were
                    unacceptable, and so they turned to the Soviets. And that became the Soviet
                    entry into the area. Well, we saw this sort of action by the Israelis as the
                    vector of Soviet penetration in the area.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Well, I can tell you a lot of stories about Amman, but—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any ones that maybe bring some things to life?

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, I don't think anything that is worth taking the time to do now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We can always add. You then came back to Washington
                        to the Department in 1957 where you were the Jordanian, Israeli and Iraqi
                        desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I came back. As I said earlier, I was evacuated with hepatitis. My
                    home leave was due. I had come home for home leave, and a vacancy opened up on
                    the Israel- Jordan desk. They asked me if I would like to take it, and I said,
                    “Yes.” So we stayed in Washington, and I didn't go back to Amman.</p>
                <p>Every one of my Foreign Service moves up to this one had been screwed up somehow.
                    We had been separated from our effects and somebody else had had to pack them
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>At that time the Office of Near Eastern Affairs was organized along the lines of
                    an Iraq-Arabian Peninsula desk, which in those days was under Dave Newsom, an
                    Egyptian-Sudan desk, a Lebanon-Syria desk, and an Israel-Jordan desk. I was on
                    Israel-Jordan desk under Don Bergus. There were two of us on the desk, and we
                    dealt with both sides of the line. I did that until somewhere in 1958.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>After the formation of the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria and the
                    Arab union between Iraq and Jordan, we reorganized to have a UAR desk—the United
                    Arab Republic desk, Egypt and Syria; an Iraq-Jordan desk—the Arab Union desk;
                    and— let's see what did we do with, I forget what we did now with Lebanon. I
                    guess we put Lebanon together with Israel. And we had an Arabian Peninsula
                    desk.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Well, let me go back and finish this story. In 1959, I left after two
                    years in NEA into the newly-formed Africa Bureau to be the Libyan desk officer
                    in the Office of North African Affairs. I did that for two years. So that
                    explains why I served on all three of those countries, actually four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it, did you find the perspective different in
                        looking at, particularly you had been in Amman but all of a sudden you had
                        responsibility or joint responsibility for Israel, too. In your eyes, did
                        you see or have a different perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, obviously. I mean, instead of just having Arabs calling—of course,
                    the Arabs were not really represented very effectively in Washington at that
                    time; you didn't hear much from them—but you did hear a lot from American Jews
                    and from Israelis. They were all over the place, and you had to respond to them,
                    and you had to take into account their view of the universe. So, yes, I think
                    it's obviously a balancing experience.</p>
                <p>We had a division of labor where Bergus handled most of the Israeli side, and I
                    handled the Jordanian side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, again, the relatively early years after the
                        creation of Israel. Did anybody ever sit down with you in the higher reaches
                        of the State Department to talk about what was our real interest in Israel,
                        or in the Arab world, other than political considerations in the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, certainly nobody higher up did. This was something we talked about
                    among ourselves in the Office of Near Eastern Affairs. We had pretty full and
                    frank discussions about it, but it was always understood that in the upper
                    reaches, this was a political issue. And whatever the area experts or
                    specialists might think of it, that in the final analysis, the political
                    reaction was going to be decisive. This was not to say that the government was
                    not prepared, particularly under Eisenhower, to confront the Israelis because we
                    did - over Suez and over the evacuation of Sinai.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I was there in this bureau at a very interesting time in terms of our
                    relationships with the Israelis. They were very unhappy with the pressures we
                    were talking about putting on them to get them to withdraw from Sinai in 1957.
                    The Israeli invasion occurred just as I got to Washington in the fall of 1956,
                    and I lived with the consequences of that pretty intensively for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out? What were you doing and what were
                        your impressions of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I was doing the sort of things that all desk officers do. It is just like
                    being a political officer with all these things that suddenly turn up. Anything
                    the Department of State does, actually does I mean, as opposed to talking about
                    it, comes down to the desk officer. He is the only person in the Department of
                    State as far as I'm concerned who really does any work. There are a lot of
                    people who sit around and talk about what's got to be done, but the desk officer
                    is just like the platoon or maybe the company commander. He is the man who has
                    to go out and do the actual digging and writing and putting of things together.
                    Somebody else clears it or changes it or disapproves his draft, but then it
                    comes back to him to redo. Except on such occasions as when you've got somebody
                    like Foster Dulles deciding that he is the desk officer, and he's doing the
                    work, and he's writing it, it's the desk officer who does it. There isn't
                    anybody in between. None of the assistant secretaries or office directors do any
                    writing of their own if they can avoid it. And the work of the Department is
                    largely writing. You've got to formulate things in a memorandum that people
                    approve and that becomes the document that authorizes expenditure of money and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>I think the most important thing I did there and one of the few positive
                    accomplishments I can record in my career was that I was the action officer for
                    something called the East Ghor, G-H-O-R, project. To make a very long story
                    short, the Eric Johnston effort to have a unified development of the Jordan
                    Valley failed. The Arabs agreed technically, but they did not agree politically.
                    And so as a substitute, in an effort to do something to help Jordan which was in
                    desperate state—after having kicked out Glubb and lost the British subsidy in
                    exchange for a promised subsidy from the Egyptians, Syrians, and Saudis which
                    they didn't pay, and after the activities of nationalists like this man Suleiman
                    Nabulsi and others were obviously leading Jordan into a situation where the king
                    was going to be sacrificed, the king called on us and asked for help. This was
                    in the spring of 1957. We then began a program of aiding Jordan. And our present
                    involvement in that country dates back to that point. A serious involvement.</p>
                <p>We were searching desperately for something to do to help Jordan. Jordan had no
                    resources except phosphates. There is a little water in the Jordan Valley, not a
                    great deal. And water in the Yarmuk, one of the tributaries of the Jordan. And
                    an idea that had been floated some ten years before but then been abandoned
                    because of the Johnston plan was to dam the Yarmuk and use that water to
                    irrigate upper terraces of the Jordan Valley, the so-called East Ghor.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I had responsibility for fighting this project through the bureaucracy which took
                    me a long time. I can't remember how many signatures. The last signature I got
                    was that of the then Under Secretary Douglas Dillon. I can't tell you what a
                    feeling of accomplishment that was for me to have this paper with his initials
                    on it in my hand, authorizing us to go ahead and give the Jordanians—I think the
                    initial sum was ten million dollars—to start this project, this diversion
                    project.</p>
                <p>It has really transformed that area of Jordan which was a howling desert into a
                    fertile, well-watered oasis. To see the water gushing down that central conduit
                    and going out into the fields is really very rewarding. It's about the only
                    material thing that I can point to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is probably almost unique is that there aren't many
                        of these.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the repercussions of the '56 Suez War, what sort
                        of involvement did you have with our policy which was relatively hard-nosed
                        as far as the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I didn't have any. It was in the hands of Mr. Dulles. My maximum
                    involvement was one day I took the Israeli ambassador, Abba Eban, to see Dulles
                    and took the notes of the conversation. Dulles was calling all the shots, and we
                    just followed his orders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did a relatively junior officer and your fellow junior
                        officers at Near Eastern Affairs evaluate Dulles in your lunchroom
                        conversations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we thought Dulles was sort of an S.O.B. We were terribly unhappy
                    about his Presbyterian conscience and his attitude that neutrality was immoral.
                    We thought he was unnecessarily hard-line with the Arabs.</p>
                <p>You know, we made a serious effort to bring down Nasser in those days. We were
                    looking for people to support. If we could have found somebody to have a coup
                    d'�tat, we would have. This was under the Eisenhower doctrine, which followed
                    the Suez affair. It is ironic that first of all, we are on the side of the
                    angels at Suez. We stopped the British and the French and the Israelis. We get
                    the Israelis out of Sinai. But at the same time, we own something called the
                    Eisenhower doctrine under which we appropriated two-hundred million dollars to
                    support any governments in the area which were threatened by regimes dominated
                    by international communism, for which read Egypt. We saw Nasser as a Soviet
                    puppet. I mean, our government did. And we on the working level thought that was
                    wrong.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask—I mean, here is one of these
                        assumptions. Was this a real assumption or was this just a justification to
                        support the pressure from the Jewish lobby and the Israelis or was this
                        really—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I think the Israelis may have helped with this, and it was something
                    that was popular with Jewish groups, but I think it was a conviction on the part
                    of Dulles as well as Eisenhower that Nasser was no gentleman. That we could not
                    do business with him, and we really ought to get rid of him.</p>
                <p>I very much liken this attitude to that Reagan has and I guess Bush does as well
                    towards Qadhafi. Qadhafi is an outlaw, therefore, you can do anything you want
                    to him. It doesn't make any difference. The difference between Qadhafi and
                    Nasser is, however, that Nasser had enormous support throughout the Arab world.
                    He was the only Arab leader who has for many years had any support outside his
                    own country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can recall in 1958 going into the marketplace in Saudi
                        Arabia and seeing nothing but pictures of Nasser at every booth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, that's right. He was all over. He was a hero to farmer and
                    industrial worker and government official alike. At the time I left Jordan, the
                    pro-Nasser feeling was very high. It changed afterwards when Hussein realized
                    that he was going to be a sacrificial victim of this surge of Arab
                    nationalism.</p>
                <p>But to get back to your question about Dulles. We saw Dulles as a very remote
                    figure who really didn't know anything about the details of what was going on in
                    the Department. He treated the Foreign Service sort of like a public
                    convenience. I once interpreted for Dulles during the visit of King Saud in
                    1957. I was one of the team of interpreters. One night I found myself
                    interpreting for Dulles and a Saudi who was a very short prince named Musaid Bin
                    Abdul Rahman, who was the chief of the diwan of complaints, he was the ombudsman
                    for Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's D-E-W-A-N?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: D-I-W-A-N.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: D-I-W-A-N.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PARKER: It's a Turkish word. It means a hall where the minister sits and receives
                    supplicants.</p>
                <p>Dulles came into this dinner. We were seated at dinner. I forget whose dinner it
                    was, it wasn't Dulles' dinner, it was somebody else's. This was a state visit. I
                    guess it was King Saud's dinner for us. It was the Mayflower Hotel or some place
                    like that. Dulles came in, sat down, said, “Good evening,” to me. And he said,
                    “Good night,” when he left. These were the only words he spoke to me all
                    evening. We were there for about two hours. I was constantly interpreting. I
                    obviously wasn't an Arab. I'm blond and freckled and don't look at all like an
                    Arab. Never any question about how I learned Arabic or who I was or anything
                    else. I could have been a telephone instrument in his hand as far as that was
                    concerned. I am not allowed to eat either, of course. I am sitting just behind
                    and between these two gentlemen.</p>
                <p>By contrast, I also interpreted for then Vice President Nixon the first night of
                    the visit when President Eisenhower entertained the king. My man was pretty high
                    in the Saudi pecking order, so I was up at the head table. I was interpreting
                    between him and Vice President Nixon. Nixon immediately wanted to know who I was
                    and how I spoke Arabic. Afterwards, during one of the intermissions on another
                    occasion, he made a point of coming up and talking to all of us. Sort of
                    politicking, but expressing some personal interest in who we were, and he was
                    pleased that we had people in the Foreign Service who could interpret like this,
                    this difficult language.</p>
                <p>Dulles was just a hopelessly remote figure. We respected and admired his
                    abilities as a lawyer, as a drafter, as a politician. But as a human being, he
                    didn't have much appeal to us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the July 1958 landings in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We all thought it was going to be a disaster. We thought the Lebanese—our
                    hearts sank when we heard this decision had been taken. I will never forget it.
                    I was the Iraqi desk officer that day. This thing started in Baghdad on the
                    fourteenth—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of July.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Fourteen of July with this Iraqi revolution. We had been monitoring the
                    situation in Jordan which was looking very shaky. An ex-military attach� was
                    plotting a coup attempt, and we were monitoring that very closely. By we, I mean
                    the CIA and the British and the Jordanians and the Iraqis. The Iraqis had just
                    sent over a delegation of generals to help the Jordanians deal with this
                    problem.</p>
                <p>I got a call from the telegram duty officer. We didn't have an operations center
                    in those days. Calling about six o'clock, and he said, “Mr. Parker, there's been
                    a revolution in Baghdad.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I said, “You mean, Amman.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, Baghdad.”</p>
                <p>I got dressed and went into the department immediately. The officer-in-charge of
                    Iraq-Jordan, Bill Lakeland, was off on leave. I was all alone. Stuff started
                    coming in from everywhere. The dimensions of this thing gradually became clear
                    to us, we realized what a terrible disaster it had been for American and British
                    policy in the area. Jordan was crying for help. The king felt threatened.
                    President Chamoun of Lebanon cashed the blank check we had given him earlier
                    under the Eisenhower doctrine. He was fighting a small scale rebellion in his
                    country. A rebellion which we had helped arrange by helping him rig the election
                    the previous year in a scandalous way. This was all coming apart and something
                    had to be done. That is, the situation in Lebanon was coming apart. We thought;
                    Chamoun thought.</p>
                <p>The initial reaction was that this was—and I've seen Allan Dulles' briefing paper
                    which is now unclassified, what he told the White House. There was a meeting in
                    the White House of the NSC. He said, “This is a Nasserist coup, and the question
                    is what to do about it.” Well, the situation was too far gone to do anything in
                    Baghdad. So they decided that we would land troops in Lebanon, and the British
                    would send troops to Jordan, to Amman, over-flying Israel in spite of Israel's
                    objections.</p>
                <p>We got this word. It was late in the day on the fourteenth. There had been this
                    meeting all afternoon. Stuart Rockwell, who was then the Director of Near
                    Eastern Affairs, to my recollection it was about six-thirty, told us that a
                    decision has been taken to land the Marines in Lebanon. I said, “Oh, my God.” I
                    was sick. I went home that night considerably later, much depressed. And it
                    worked. This just goes to show you how wrong your students of the area can be.
                    It had no business working, but it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Saudi Arabia at the time, and our general
                        impression was all hell was going to break loose here. We all were confined
                        to the city to our compound. We wouldn't go into town. The only agitation
                        came through one of the shopkeepers of the town saying, you know, “Where are
                        all the American buyers?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was remarkable the way they were greeted. We performed very
                    effectively. It was unfortunate in my view.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I always maintained that you can draw a straight line from Lebanon to our
                    involvement in the Dominican Republic and in Vietnam. That this was a classic
                    case of limited warfare. The doctrine of limited warfare. Fight on the ground
                    and see how well it worked. Because it worked in Lebanon, you follow the same
                    rules and you can do it elsewhere. Well, obviously, it was not a precedent for
                    other places.</p>
                <p>There are some lessons to be learned from it. One of them is to get in and get
                    out quickly and not get involved in shooting people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: But you've got to have certain requirements which fortunately were there
                    in the form of somebody waiting in the wings: the army commander who could take
                    over as president and restore peace. If you tried to do the same thing today,
                    you would have great difficulty I think finding anybody in Lebanon who would be
                    widely acceptable as president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving from this area to your time as a desk officer for
                        Libya, and we are talking about 1959 to '61.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our prime concerns in Libya at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, this was also fortuitous. I had arranged a switch. Dayton Mak had
                    been the Libyan desk officer. He was going up to the NEA front office. A job he
                    wanted up there. So I asked for and got his job. It was wonderful because nobody
                    knew anything about Libya, and nobody cared very much. I was left very much on
                    my own.</p>
                <p>But almost at the same time that I took over, about a month before that, Esso
                    brought in its first major well in Cyrenaica, Zelten 2, I believe it was called.
                    I forget what it was - 25,000 barrels a day or 35,000. Anyway, it was a big
                    well. And the oil rush was on, and it continued for many years thereafter.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>We immediately had to consider what would be the consequences of this for the
                    U.S. position in Libya. At that time, we had an air base, Wheelus Field, outside
                    Tripoli which we had had since World War II, thanks to the then desk officer,
                    whoever that was at the end of the war. The Air Force didn't have any interest
                    in that base, and they were trying to turn it over to somebody, to the British I
                    guess. The Department said, you know, you may want that later. Nobody is asking
                    for it. Let's hold on to it for a while. And in time, it became an installation
                    which the Air Force said was vital to our state of readiness in Europe. What it
                    was used for was training. People would come down there from Europe. Planes
                    would land and take off every minute, jets all day long. They would go out to
                    bombing ranges in the desert and make all sorts of training flights. The weather
                    there was sunny 360 days of the year. No place in Europe could you have that
                    sort of weather. The Air Force continually said that they could not maintain the
                    readiness of forces in Europe if they did not have Wheelus. So it was very
                    important to us.</p>
                <p>Now we were paying the Libyans something like six million dollars a year as a
                    subsidy. We wouldn't call it rent for Wheelus, but that's what it was. And the
                    question was: What was this oil discovery going to mean for our tenure at
                    Wheelus?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It will raise the rent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It will raise the rent. Well, in the Office of North African Affairs, we
                    argued. The office was presided over by Bill Porter, William J. Porter, who died
                    last year, who was the most skillful bureaucrat I ever knew. He was really
                    wonderful at manipulating the bureaucracy. He would give me sort of general
                    instructions as to what to do. But he agreed that we really had to get the Air
                    Force to pay rent, to up the ante and really pay rent. We had to have some sort
                    of contract for this base. We were going to have this base for X number of
                    years, and we are going to pay you a million dollars for it.</p>
                <p>This is back in the days of the Operations Coordinating Board and the Planning
                    Council—is it Planning Council or Planning Staff? The group that went up to the
                    National Security Council. I had to have a paper. This is my second paper chase.
                    It took a year to get a paper all the way through the bureaucracy up to the
                    National Security Council setting forth the policy eventually approved by the
                    President that we would pay rent for Wheelus, dragging the Air Force kicking and
                    screaming all the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is always a tendency to try to do it on the
                        cheap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And for short term gains there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the Air Force position was this is Libya's contribution to the
                    defense of the free world. And we are defending Libya and the rest of the free
                    world, and they should do this for their own sake. We don't mind helping Libya,
                    but we think it's a very bad precedent to establish that we pay rent for these
                    places. It's a matter of principle.</p>
                <p>I argued that if you don't agree to do this, you are going to lose your air base.
                    They kept it for ten more years, largely because they finally agreed to pay
                    rent. They would have lost it within five years.</p>
                <p>In the course of this—one of the things I would like to go back to. Another
                    little success I had was in the second stage of this paper arguing before the
                    planning staff just below the NSC. And that's as far as I could go in
                    participation. After that, it had to be the assistant secretary who took the
                    paper to the National Security Council.</p>
                <p>Arguing with a man named Robert Amory with CIA, much senior to me and a very
                    intelligent and capable man, who said in effect that my predictions as to what
                    Libyan oil revenues would be was wildly inaccurate. It was not going to be any
                    where near the six-hundred million that I was predicting. Well, the six-hundred
                    million wasn't my figure. It was a figure I had gotten after talking to a lot of
                    oil people, sort of averaging out their estimates. He said, “They won't get
                    anything like that. They might get three-hundred million and that's all”., or
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>I don't know that it would have made much difference to a people who up to that
                    point had a GNP of maybe, if you were lucky, maybe they had fifty million
                    dollars a year. Well, the thing is, of course, that my six-hundred million
                    estimate was far short of the mark. I think that was at the end of five years.
                    At the end of five years, I think they had something like a billion dollars a
                    year. And it went on from there to twenty or thirty billion, I think, in
                    1980.</p>
                <p>You know, there are not many times in a career when you can point to something
                    where you have really been right, and the other fellow was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Any career of that reflection. I mean, there really
                        are remarkably few. Should we move on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Sure, let's move on. We are taking a lot of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Your next assignment was as a political officer to
                        Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1961 to '64. What were you doing, and what was the
                        situation there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, this was part of the Golden Age of Lebanon. Beirut was a wonderful
                    place to be. Very open society. You got to know everybody. You spent most of
                    your time trying to fend off people who were trying to tell you things. The
                    problem was never one of not enough information, but of too much information. We
                    were trying to decide what was true and what was false and what was worth
                    reporting. The Lebanese have always tended to take their politics too seriously.
                    Something that is not shared by our people.</p>
                <p>I had, again, two officers in the section. Myself and one other. I had a couple
                    of other people attached to me. We had a geographic attach� and a U.N. Relief
                    and Works Administration for Palestine Refugees attach� and the Dhahran liaison
                    group, which was responsible for evacuation plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Evacuation plans, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Had been moved to Beirut and that man was attached to my section. And I
                    had a couple of local employees who did translating.</p>
                <p>My job was to stay in touch with the politicians, the members of parliament, with
                    people in general and find out what was going on which, as I say, was very easy.
                    A lot of parties. A lot of late nights. Long lunches. Very hard on the liver.
                    Three cocktail parties a night. Three cocktail parties and a dinner was sort of
                    standard, five nights a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't know if this is reflected of this, but I can
                        honestly say at this point I can't remember whom I asked, but somebody who
                        worked in Washington was also one of your Arabists who was in NEA at one
                        point or another who said . . . I asked him about how he evaluated the
                        reporting from the different posts. He said, “Well, they are mostly very
                        sound except for Lebanon, of course.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: That was Harry Symmes. I heard that. Harry's attitude unfortunately was
                    typical of the Department in general and posts in the area. They didn't take
                    Lebanon seriously. And I can understand why this would be the case. And I must
                    say, in effect, to go from Lebanon to Egypt as I did makes you realize how petty
                    Lebanese political concerns were. And it's true that we had a number of
                    ambassadors in Lebanon who weren't particularly—I would not put them in the
                    category of particularly insightful in their reporting. Still, I like to think
                    my reporting was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The only thing of any great moment was the upcoming presidential elections which
                    people had been running for three years in advance and which took place in 1964.
                    There is a great story there of American involvement in that process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, you were talking about the election in Lebanon and
                        your reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. In 1958, we had sent Robert Murphy out right after the Marines
                    landed. He had sort of acted as the deus ex machina to facilitate the election
                    of General Fuad Chehab, the army commander, as the president to succeed Camille
                    Chamoun. Chehab, C-H-E-H-A-B, had been rather successful as president, although
                    not as successful as a lot of people today think. There were many warts on him.
                    The most important of which was that he was a minimalist. He didn't believe in
                    really doing anything, but perhaps that's the best way to rule Lebanon.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of jockeying for position among the various candidates, Maronite
                    candidates. Every Maronite Christian in Lebanon, male, is a potential president.
                    And they were all moving around and all trying to get the American endorsement
                    which was considered to be very important. You had to get the French endorsement
                    and the American endorsement. The American was more important than the French.
                    Everybody looking for signs that we favored this person or that person. It was
                    rather tricky business.</p>
                <p>Armin Meyer, the ambassador, got into trouble a couple of times because of
                    innocent remarks that were taken out of context and misinterpreted. People were,
                    on the one hand, very sensitive about the idea of American interference. And on
                    the other hand, desperately anxious to have it. This resulted in a very
                    interesting political ballet which we all danced around pretending one thing and
                    looking the candidates over and not saying anything about them. But Armin Meyer
                    has a very interesting story to tell about this, and I'll let him tell it on his
                    tape.</p>

                <p>This was a very pleasant tour. It was a wonderful place to watch what was going

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the situation was at the time and
                        how our embassy was run? Was it an embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, yes. It was a big embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just before the 1967 war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Not nearly as big as it is today but big enough. I was political
                    counselor. In effect, I was the number three in the embassy. Things started
                    popping as soon as I got there, and they never stopped until I left. As opposed
                    to Lebanon, where you are talking about little petty political preoccupations,
                    we are talking sort of life and death matters. War in the Yemen, and war with
                    Israel. People starving. Million dollar, billion dollar projects and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>It was a much bigger country. Ten times the size of Lebanon's population. And
                    much more important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, first, let's talk a little about the embassy. Who
                        was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The ambassador was Lucius Battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, he had a lot of experience at upper levels of the Department. He
                    knew everybody. He was personable. He operated very much along a warm human
                    basis. He left me pretty much alone as far as reporting was concerned. There
                    were certain things that I did under this general direction. But by and large, I
                    was left alone. He left the daily running of the embassy to his deputy chief of
                    mission, who was at that time David Nes. And I think it was a rather well-run
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of problems there. It was a very difficult country. The Egyptians
                    were very suspicious of us. After trying to bring Nasser down under Eisenhower
                    in '57 and '58, we had gradually in the last year of the Eisenhower
                    administration, begun to be a little more sophisticated about Egypt. Under
                    Kennedy, we had embarked on a massive program of PL 480 commodities as aid to
                    Egypt hoping to divert Egypt's attention from foreign ventures into building of
                    a viable Egyptian economy. It didn't work. Unfortunately, after about three
                    years, it began to come apart. I mean, the whole idea did because of the
                    Egyptian involvement in the Yemen which was seen a threat to our friend, the
                    Saudis. The real crisis came with the Stanleyville rescue operation.
                    Stanleyville—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain about how this—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, this is '64, in the early fall of '64. There was a group of
                    Europeans and Americans who are being held hostage in Stanleyville in the Congo.
                    We flew in Belgian paratroopers to rescue the hostages. There was a great uproar
                    about this among Africans who charged that this was foreign interference in
                    internal affairs in African countries. And in Cairo, there was a demonstration
                    against the embassy in which a great deal of damage was done. The Marine house
                    and the USIA library were burned down. The yard was full of flowerpots that the
                    mob threw at the building and broke all the windows. A lot of damage. The
                    Egyptians never did come around and apologize.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, the Egyptian minister of supply asked our ambassador what he
                    was going to do about supplying more wheat. And the ambassador said, “Well, you
                    haven't said you are sorry yet.” And as soon as Nasser heard this, he got up and
                    made his famous “drink from the sea” speech at Suez in December of '64 which
                    said, in effect, you know, you can take your aid and stuff it if you don't like
                    what we are doing.</p>
                <p>Well, there was nothing better calculated to turn Lyndon Baines Johnson off than
                    a remark like that. From that point on, we were in trouble. We were back into a
                    position where Nasser was a bad boy, and we really had given up more or less the
                    idea that we were going to be able to do business with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>We continued aid, but we tried to be fine-tune it, I think is the phrase that
                    somebody used. Instead of promising a year's supply at a time, we promised three
                    months or six months with the understanding that if they did something nasty to
                    us in the Yemen or some place, the next three months would not be coming. It was
                    an attempt to use aid as a political weapon. And it didn't work. It didn't work
                    in this case. A classic example of not working.</p>
                <p>Nasser eventually convinced himself that we were trying to assassinate him. Our
                    communications were terrible. It was this lack of communications between us and
                    Nasser's paranoia about our intentions which were fed by Johnson's paranoia. The
                    two men were very similar in this respect. Both of them were suffering from what
                    I learned since is called narcissistic rage.</p>
                <p>Then the crisis came in May of 1967 that led to the June war, we had no
                    credibility in Cairo. There are still senior Egyptians, serious people, who will
                    argue that the 1967 war was an American-Israeli trap. I just had the Egyptian
                    ambassador here saying to me, “Well, isn't it true you people were trying to
                    bring down Nasser at this point?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we come to what happened there. At this time, when
                        things were getting bad, did you find at the embassy you—and I'm talking
                        about the embassy as a whole—particularly you and the ambassador were trying
                        in whatever way you could to bridge this gap of misunderstanding between the
                        two, or was this a lost cause?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we were trying very hard. I never did give up. You know, who was
                    it, Adlai Stevenson who said, “Optimism is to a diplomat as courage is to a
                    soldier.” You have to keep looking for the positive elements of the situation
                    that you can exploit. I kept hoping that one way or another, we would get over
                    this obstacle or that. But, you know, it's like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up
                    the hill in Hell. Every time you got to the top of the hill, and you thought you
                    got this thing tied down, whatever it was would come apart because either Nasser
                    or Johnson would say something or do something that was calculated to infuriate
                    the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are really talking about two very large egos more
                        than national interests guiding this relationship at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I think so, yes. I think it was very personal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so in many ways, the Israeli factor was not as much as
                        a factor in this—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>PARKER: No, no. The Israelis and the Lebanese and the Libyans and the Jordanians
                    and the Saudis, particularly the Saudis—King Faisal, who once had been an ally
                    of Nasser's against Jordan, now was violently anti-Nasser— these people and our
                    ambassadors in those places were all urging us to do something to restrain
                    Nasser. The favorite Arab expression for this was “turn off the faucet,
                    manipulate the faucet” in order to put pressure on. The Israelis were in this—it
                    was not a cabal because they weren't all together—but they were arguing the same
                    thing. They were making common cause with the Saudis.</p>
                <p>But the Arab-Israel question, the Palestine issue, actually was, by agreement
                    with the Egyptians, on the back burner. We kept talking about it being in the
                    ice box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it part of the problem was the Yemen war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, this is a war that is often forgotten. Could you
                        tell a little about the Yemen war and how we interpreted it at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the Yemen which is one of the more backward countries—and I'm
                    speaking now of what we call North Yemen today or the Yemen Arab Republic—Yemen
                    had been one of the more backward Arab countries. Someone once said it was
                    rushing headlong into the fifteenth century. It had a ruler called an Imam,
                    I-M-A-M, just like the Imam Khomeini. It means Muslim leader.</p>
                <p>He was overthrown in an army revolution/coup d'�tat in 1962. The Egyptians
                    immediately came to the aid of this revolution and began sending troops down
                    there. Eventually, the Egyptians were, in effect, running North Yemen. They were
                    in control, and they were more or less like the Syrians in Lebanon. They were an
                    army of occupation much resented by the Yemenis.</p>
                <p>I have to talk about my rescue mission down there in a minute, but I will come
                    back to this point.</p>
                <p>The Saudis supported the royal family which, somewhat to everybody's surprise and
                    uncharacteristic of Middle Eastern coup d'�tats, organized a fairly effective
                    guerrilla campaign against the revolutionaries and the Yemeni army and the
                    Egyptians. And they kept up the fight in Northern Yemen. Occasionally, the
                    Egyptians would come over and bomb places in Saudi Arabia. At one point, they
                    tried dropping weapons to purported insurgents inside Saudi Arabia. This really
                    infuriated the Saudis.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>There were a lot of efforts to resolve the problem. We were engaged in one.
                    Ambassador Bunker and Talcott Seelye were engaged in an effort. There was a U.N.
                    effort to try to reach some sort of a cease-fire and a truce. They all fell
                    apart sooner or later. The war was still going on at a rather—what we would
                    call—a low intensity level of conflict when the war came in 1967.</p>
                <p>The Yemen affair, more than anything else, soured our relations with Nasser.
                    Various ambassadors would say to Nasser, or Nasser would say to us, “Our
                    problems are not bilateral. Our problems all concern third countries.” In this
                    case, the contest for our affections was between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. And
                    Saudi Arabia won, primarily because of the oil, I think.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the degree of Egyptian involvement there. About Easter in 1967,
                    there was an attack on a Yemeni army post at Taiz in the southern capital, where
                    we had a branch embassy and where our aid mission was. This was in the middle of
                    the night. Somebody with a bazooka or bazookas attacked this Yemeni army post.
                    And the Yemenis, at Egyptian prodding, accused two AID Americans, one of whom
                    was an Alexandrian Greek and spoke Arabic, of perpetrating this attack. A mob
                    very quickly formed and sacked the AID offices. And President Sallal,
                    S-A-L-L-A-L, ordered the withdrawal of the AID mission, and we sent everybody
                    out to Asmara over in Eritrea.</p>
                <p>In Asmara, the AID mission director, a man named Robert Hamer, said sort of
                    incidentally, “There are some classified and compromising papers in the safe
                    behind my desk.” The place had been sacked and stormed by a mob at the lunch
                    hour when everybody was out of the building, and the Americans had never gotten
                    back in. He said, “You really ought to try to see if you can get those back.”
                    Well, we began trying to get entry back into the building. The building had been
                    sealed by the Yemenis at Egyptian direction. The Egyptians were in there. Our
                    people could see them at night with a welding torch trying to cut their way into
                    the safe. It was a little safe. A two- drawer safe. And the ground—well, I can't
                    quote from that, this is a family record. But you could see the traces of this
                    thing all throughout the building. The asbestos lining of it had come out as
                    they had taken it from one place to another and tried hitting it with sledge
                    hammers. They finally carted it away, and they got it open somehow. We never saw
                    that safe again.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, negotiated an agreement by
                    telegram with Abdul Hakim Amir the commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces, to
                    send a team down to retrieve our classified papers inside this building. There
                    was a lot of talk about the right of legation. Rusk kept referring to the right
                    of legation and how sacred it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>So I was sent down to the Yemen with a team of three other officers: Gordon
                    Brown, who is now DCM in Tunis, Nat Howell, who is ambassador in Kuwait, and a
                    security technician named Don Hackel—I don't know where he is now. We were taken
                    down there on a UAR, a military, aircraft in the middle of the night.
                    Sequestered so we couldn't talk to anybody on the aircraft. And taken to Sanaa
                    and then taken in the Egyptian commander's airplane down to Taiz where my team
                    was allowed into the building. As I say, we never found the little safe behind
                    Hamer's desk. But we did get into the strong room. They had a strong room there
                    where the files were.</p>
                <p>It was the most horrific security violation I have ever seen. Those people down
                    there—we didn't have a xerox machine in those days—they used a thing called a
                    thermofax, which made a rather fuzzy copy of things. Because everybody in NEA
                    repeated telegrams all around the lot, to all the NEA posts, we routinely sent
                    telegrams about anything important happening in Cairo, to Taiz and to Sanaa. The
                    little embassy office in Taiz would send a copy over a block away to the AID
                    office where, contrary to all regulations, they were making copies. There must
                    have been half a dozen filing cabinets, four-drawer filing cabinets, full of
                    classified telegrams up to and including Top Secret, all of which had been
                    copied in violation of security regulations.</p>
                <p>These cabinets had all been left open. The file clerk had gone off to lunch.
                    Fortunately, she had closed the outer door. As far as we could tell, nobody had
                    gotten in there. Things were not disturbed. They were in chronological order and
                    so forth. I just think it would have been beyond Egyptian or any police
                    abilities to do that without disturbing things, to go through them. And anyway,
                    they would have taken them away, they wouldn't have put them back. You can't
                    copy a thermofax copy.</p>
                <p>So we put this stuff in big pouches and hauled it back up to the embassy branch
                    office which had a tiny little incinerator, and we burned for forty-eight
                    hours.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, these two Americans, Liapis and Hartman, L-I-A-P-I-S and
                    H-A-R-T-M-A-N, were being held in detention in a little house up the hill. I
                    would go call on them every day to see how they were—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the AID people who had been accused of—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Attacking the Yemeni post. We subsequently learned that the attack had
                    been carried out by a guerrilla group supported by the British. The British were
                    responsible for this. Americans had nothing to do with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I would go every day to see Liapis and Hartman and hold their hands and see how
                    they were getting along. After we finished burning the papers, I was ready to go
                    home. I went to see them on the last day. As I was there, the governor of Taiz
                    came in and read off a notification that they were being charged with—I forget
                    what it was—sedition or something. Anyway, it was a capital offense, and they
                    would be taken to Sanaa, to the capital, to be tried. I was told by the
                    Department that I would have to stay with them. I told the Department that I
                    wanted to come home, and I got a message back saying, “You go with them. You
                    stay with Liapis and Hartman.”</p>
                <p>So I went up to Sanaa with them. Lee Dinsmore, our charg�, worked out a deal with
                    the Yemen authorities whereby he put up two (or ten?) thousand dollars in cash
                    out of his evacuation fund for bail. And we took off with them with the
                    understanding that we would bring them back for trial, but everybody knew we
                    never would.</p>
                <p>And I flew out to Asmara with them and got back to Cairo on about the fifteenth
                    or sixteenth of May at which point the crisis which led to the June war was
                    in—what shall I say—full swing. Nasser had alerted his forces, had sent troops
                    into Sinai and had or was about to call for the withdrawal of the United Nations
                    Emergency Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any—I mean, this June war was coming. I mean,
                        was this something that Nasser expected? How did we read it before the
                        fact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It's something that nobody expected. I am at the moment trying to
                    research the chronology of this thing, and it's remarkable how there was no
                    indication. When I went off to Sanaa on about the first of May, there was no
                    hint. We knew we were in for a difficult summer because in his May Day speech,
                    Nasser had concentrated on the United States and how it was going to frustrate
                    the Arab revolution. We knew something was likely to happen, but nobody was
                    thinking in terms of war, including the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefly, just to put people in the picture who are reading
                        this transcript, how did this work out? I mean, what did Nasser do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the story very briefly is the Soviets and the Syrians—I believe,
                    this is not clear yet, the Soviets certainly—told the Egyptians that the
                    Israelis were massing troops on the Syrian border. There had been a lot of
                    tension between Syria and Israel. This report was untrue, but the Egyptians
                    chose to take it seriously and to disregard all of our denials and Israeli
                    denials and U.N. denials. And this is when our lack of communications were a
                    real problem, a real handicap.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Nasser, apparently convinced that his army was ready to take on Israel, requested
                    the withdrawal of the United Nations Forces along the border between Israel and
                    Egypt. And he closed the Strait of Tiran which leads into the Gulf of Aqaba to
                    Israeli shipping. This was threatening the Israeli oil life line, which came by
                    tanker from Iran. This is a long and complicated story, but the Israelis—as
                    everybody had expected, once he closed the Strait which was clearly going to be
                    taken as a cause for war—the Israelis attacked ten days later and destroyed the
                    Egyptian air force on the ground and routed the Egyptian army from Sinai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, how did the embassy—what were you all doing during
                        this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we pretty damn busy I can tell you that. In the first place,
                    Battle, the ambassador, had gone home. He left on, I think, St. Patrick's Day.
                    Nolte, the new ambassador, a political appointee, a prot�g� of the Under
                    Secretary, Katzenbach, had come out. A man who was a student of the area. A
                    lifetime grants man, he had spent most of his time going from one grant to
                    another. But a very—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say foundation grant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Very knowledgeable about the area. He had lived in Egypt before and
                    well-regarded, but absolutely no government or Foreign Service experience at
                    all. And it was sort of like sending Hanson W. Baldwin out to command a division
                    in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hanson Baldwin being a—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: A military commentator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A military commentator for the New York Times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Right. Highly respected for his military knowledge, but without any
                    really relevant experience or training for this sort of combat job he was
                    suddenly thrust into. What this meant was that an enormous load fell upon David
                    Nes and myself to try to keep things together.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>It became clear to us from various statements of the parties that this thing was
                    headed towards war. We evacuated our dependents on the twenty-sixth of May, and
                    we began buttoning down. We began burning papers. We couldn't burn them fast
                    enough. And I discovered there, something I wish our people in Tehran had known,
                    and that is that the defense attach�s and the CIA people have enormous
                    quantities of paper that they will lie and cheat about rather than destroy. And
                    getting them to burn their stuff is really difficult. We have this fixation on
                    paper that I wish something could be done about.</p>
                <p>Anyway, when the war came, the first day we still had a lot of paper to burn, and
                    we went up on the roof, we had this chemical that you use in barrels. It burns
                    with great speed, but it is explosive if it's confined. They had this barrel
                    full of papers, and they put the chemical in it, and they put the lid on it, and
                    it exploded. This lid went two or three- hundred feet in the air and a great
                    column of fire went up. The fire department was there in a matter of minutes.
                    They thought the embassy had been hit, and the war was on. The Israelis were
                    bombing, and everybody thought we had taken a hit of some sort.</p>
                <p>The first day was full of communiqu�s about how many Israeli planes the Egyptians
                    had shot down, when in fact, they hadn't shot more than a handful, if any. The
                    next day we woke up—I still remember this, it was a nightmare for me—to the UAR
                    television announcing that the Americans and British had participated in the
                    Israeli attack on Egypt. This was the sixth. They broke relations that night and
                    ordered the evacuation of everybody except the small team that was to remain
                    behind.</p>
                <p>I will never forget the three colonels from the Egyptian Ministry of Interior
                    coming to the embassy about eight o'clock, just as we were getting ready to
                    leave, saying, “We have here the names and addresses of all the Americans living
                    in Egypt. We want to sit down with your consular officer and go over the list,
                    and arrange to notify all of these people and assemble them tonight to leave.
                    They all must be assembled in assembly areas tonight.” That was sort of comic.
                    Our consular section had been going over its records and refining them very
                    carefully the preceding two weeks and had a pretty up-to-date list. They found
                    that the Egyptian list was totally inaccurate. It was wild. What happened is our
                    consular officers—I think there were three of them—went around with the
                    Egyptians with our list, knocking on doors in the middle of the night. This went
                    on all night. We concentrated all these people in a couple hotels. They were
                    eventually shipped out. They included one woman down at Aswan who had been there
                    since 1916 and whose passport was one of the original—the document was one of
                    the, you know, the open folding—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Folding type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Not in a book, but a piece of paper.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Well, I was designated to be left in charge of this contingent that was to stay
                    behind. I spent a lot of time at the Foreign Ministry trying to work out the
                    details of how many people we could have and who they were and so forth. And it
                    had been agreed that I was going to remain behind with five other people. The
                    others were all going to leave on Friday night, the tenth.</p>
                <p>At seven-thirty, Nasser came on the air and read his resignation speech.
                    Seven-thirty on the tenth, or seven o'clock. We were having a farewell dinner at
                    the ambassador's residence, Nolte and Nes and the Public Affairs Officer, Bob
                    Bauer, and I, and we were drinking a bottle of champagne and eating up a couple
                    of filets mignons that were in the refrigerator, when Nasser came on and made
                    this speech which was a surprise to everybody. Suddenly, there was an enormous
                    outpouring of people into the street and a great roar and shooting and God
                    know's what was happening.</p>
                <p>Just at that point, the Spanish ambassador called. The Spanish had taken charge
                    of our interests. The Spanish ambassador called and said, “Mr. Parker, I have
                    orders that you are to leave with the others tonight.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “That's impossible.” I hadn't been home for five days. I left my
                    residence and my dog, my silver, my clothes, my everything on June 5.. I hadn't
                    been back home the whole week. We lived out in Maadi which is a suburb south of
                    Cairo. I said, “I can't leave now.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I'm afraid you will have to.”</p>
                <p>We tried some calling. Our CIA man went out to see the Director of Intelligence,
                    and he said there was no ifs. The order came from Nasser himself. We all left on
                    the train. There were detectives on the train to see that I specifically was on
                    that train. No explanation given.</p>
                <p>Many years later, twenty years later, I learned that it was because Nasser
                    thought I was the chief of station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The head of the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The head of the CIA. But in fact, the man they left in charge was the
                    chief of station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much for Egyptian intelligence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, so much for Egyptian intelligence.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So I came back. Well, we had a hell of a time. A terrible time going up to
                    Alexandria and spending the day there waiting for a Greek ship to come in and
                    pick us up. It was an inter-island ferry that had never been further away from
                    Athens than Crete. They burst a boiler getting to Alexandria. But we got
                    everybody on that ship eventually and got back to Athens.</p>
                <p>Again, at this point, I had long been due for home leave at that point. I was to
                    have two tours in Egypt. I had been there two years, and I had home leave
                    orders. Everybody else was staying in Athens.</p>
                <p>I found out that the deputy chief of mission, Dave Nes, on the trip, which had
                    taken a couple of days, made some very frank comments to a Baltimore journalist.
                    Nes was from Baltimore, and he once worked for the Sun papers. And there was a
                    Sun reporter named Franklin Fenton—I think it was Franklin. Fenton at any rate,
                    on the ship. To whom Nes, who was really sore about the great gap between
                    Battle's departure in the middle of March and Nolte's arrival two months later,
                    apparently with no sense of urgency. And the way that the Department had been
                    treating Cairo anyway. He just let himself go. He said some very frank things,
                    and they were quite true, of course. I think the Department was really pretty
                    stupid, not to say incompetent, in the way it handled this affair. But things
                    had really hit the fan in Washington. Fenton had reported this as soon as he got
                    off the boat. Or maybe he was still on the boat. I've got the chronology mixed
                    up by now. But anyway, Nes had gotten off the boat and gotten the first plane
                    out.</p>
                <p>I spent one night in Athens, and the next morning, I got this news about the Nes
                    revelations. I thought I better get back there because there were going to be a
                    lot of questions about this. So I got a plane out that afternoon. My family had
                    already been evacuated, and they were at Lake Champlain in Vermont. I went to
                    Washington and then went back up and joined them.</p>
                <p>There wasn't anything for me to do, but what transpired during the summer was
                    that Don Bergus, my former chief in Israel-Jordan affairs, whom I had succeeded
                    in Cairo, had been the political counselor before me, had gone back to be the
                    Country Director for UAR affairs, and was sent back out to Cairo to succeed me.
                    I mean, he took my job as the chief of the U.S. interest section. And I took his
                    job in Washington. We kept going around in these ever decreasing circles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask what happened to Nes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Nes came back, and he had a hearing before Senator Fulbright, who said,
                    “I want to be sure this man gets a job commensurate with his rank and
                    importance.” They gave him an office up in the sixth or seventh floor of old New
                    State. The old building of New State, the original New State.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old War Department building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, well, yes, that's right. And it was a paneled office. The paneling
                    wasn't real. It looked like plywood that had been painted. I don't know what it
                    had ever been used for. I had no idea this office existed. It was off in a very
                    strange location, very hard to get to. There was a secretary in the outer
                    office, but the office had no function. His name was on the payroll, but he had
                    nothing to do. They had given him an office, and he couldn't complain because he
                    had a wood-paneled office. He was left there to sort of die on the vine. He
                    retired shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, here you were with an abysmal situation as you can
                        between the relations between two countries. Everybody is kicked out except
                        a small section. Were you able to put things back together? You were in
                        charge of—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I wouldn't say I was able to put things back together. But I really
                    was very sore at the Egyptians when I came back. I felt sorry for them for their
                    defeat of their army and so forth. A terrible catastrophe for Egypt. But I
                    thought Nasser had behaved very badly, and I personally had been terribly
                    bruised by it, and I didn't have much sympathy to spare.</p>
                <p>Actually, we in the absence of relations worked out a fairly satisfactory working
                    relationship with these interest sections. Both sides very quickly abandoned the
                    pretense that the sponsoring power would have to escort the representative when
                    he called on the Foreign Minister.</p>

                    G-H-O-R-B-A-L, as the chief of their interest section. Both sections were
                    limited to the number of people—something on the order of eight to begin with,
                    and we gradually raised it, I think, to eighteen.</p>
                <p>We had no particular interest left in Egypt. All the Americans had been kicked
                    out. But there were many Egyptian students here. Something like fifteen-hundred
                    of them. And the Egyptians wanted to keep the students here, wanted them to
                    finish their studies. So they needed people here to run that program because
                    these people were all here on government scholarships.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Ghorbal proved to be I think the most effective of all the Arab representatives
                    in Washington. He was Harvard-educated. He understood something about America.
                    He had a sense of humor. He knew he was starting from zero, and he was ready to
                    learn. And I took him in hand and taught him the ropes as far as I knew them on
                    how to operate in Washington. He was a very apt pupil, far surpassing me in his
                    capabilities in this respect. He eventually was the first ambassador here after
                    the restoration of relations in '73 or '74—I forget which year that was. Even
                    before that, he was remarkably effective. Similarly, I think Bergus was very
                    effective in Cairo. He certainly had a lot more influence than the Spanish
                    ambassador or any other ambassador there. He was in very well until he came a
                    cropper over a memorandum he was supposed to have written. He should tell that
                    story, not I.</p>
                <p>I did that for three years. A very frustrating job. Very hard to get anybody to
                    pay any attention to Egypt. Very hard to get anybody to take Egypt seriously. I
                    remember Secretary of State William Rogers at one point saying he had lots of
                    the milk of human kindness, but he had none at all for Gamal Abdel Nasser. That
                    was the attitude. It was not until 1973 and the crossing of the canal that
                    people began to take Egypt seriously. Everybody in those days - Israelis,
                    Americans - believed that they had no military capabilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the story that what does it take to be an
                        effective military force. And the reply was, “Well, in the first place,
                        fight the Egyptians.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the type of story that went around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well, the Egyptians were very poorly served in '67. I think they
                    have since shown that they have some military capabilities.</p>
                <p>At the end of three years, I was ready to get out. And I was very disturbed
                    because I discovered that Joe Sisco, the Assistant Secretary, was working on a
                    draft peace proposal involving Egypt without consulting me. He was not somebody
                    I enjoyed working for anyway, and I was tired of the climate and lack of support
                    from him and from everybody else in NEA. I wanted to get out. Stuart Rockwell,
                    then the Deputy Assistant Secretary, was appointed as ambassador to Morocco, and
                    he asked me if I would like to come and be his deputy Chief of Mission. I had
                    always wanted to go to Morocco, and I said, “Sure,” and we left in the summer of
                    1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little about Joseph Sisco, his
                        operating style, how he was viewed by people in NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, Joe was a hard charging Calabrian bandit. He reputedly had a
                    sign—instead of having one of those IBM signs that says, “Think,” he had one
                    that said, “Scheme,” in his office. I crossed swords with him on a number of
                    occasions. I did not like working for him and very few of my colleagues did.</p>
                <p>In his defense, I would say he was a very forceful administrator. He was very
                    effective in making NEA the center of attention. Getting things for us that
                    milder and nicer people had not done. A very effective bureaucrat. A very hard
                    in- fighter. Somebody with a real instinct for the jugular. Not somebody that
                    you want to take lightly. Not somebody that I would ever care to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we have already had an interview with Ambassador
                        Rockwell on Morocco, but I would like sort of the viewpoint of what you were
                        doing and how you saw the situation when you were in Rabat and how you
                        operated as deputy Chief of Mission. We are talking about the period from
                        1970 to '74.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Stuart Rockwell was perhaps the most competent Foreign Service Officer I
                    have ever known in terms of his drafting skill and his understanding of
                    diplomacy and so forth. When he was ambassador, I had very little to do as
                    deputy Chief of Mission except to sort of run the embassy. He did everything
                    else. I was rather bored by it in fact. But I was thankful to be there at a
                    place where not too much was demanded of me because in the middle of my second
                    year, in December of 1971, I had to come back to the States for open heart
                    surgery. I was very glad to go back to an essentially restful place for the rest
                    of my tour there.</p>
                <p>He left in 1973 and was succeeded by Robert Neumann, who was a political
                    appointee. A very different sort of person. One of the most highly disorganized
                    people I have ever worked for. It was a lot of fun working for him because I
                    felt that if I weren't there to pick up the pieces that he scattered as we went
                    along, everything would fall apart. I felt much more important under him than I
                    did under Rockwell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would like to move on then to your first
                        appointment as an ambassador which was to Algeria. How did this come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I was set back by this heart operation. I would have gone to
                    Nouakchott as ambassador in 1971 if it hadn't been for that.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Mauritania.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I sort of despaired at getting an ambassadorial post in 1974. Henry
                    Tasca, our ambassador in Athens, asked for me as deputy Chief of Mission. I
                    always wanted to go to Athens. I said, “All right.” This was a senior DCM post.
                    I was all set to go when, well to make a very long and complicated story short,
                    my orders were changed, and I was sent to Algiers instead to be chief of the
                    interest section there.</p>
                <p>The Algerians had also broken relations with us in 1967. I was sent with the
                    understanding that I would be the first ambassador when relations were renewed,
                    which came to pass about four months after I got there. I went out just at the
                    time of Nixon's resignation. So I was appointed by President Ford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Algeria when you went out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, a very difficult situation in the sense that although American
                    companies were very active there, the political environment was hostile. They
                    had enormous contracts. Two-billion dollars worth of contracts, which was quite
                    a bit of money in 1974. They were building installations for the oil
                    industry.</p>
                <p>We had good economic relations, but our political relations were at best cool. It
                    was a very difficult climate. The Algerians are very suspicious of us, and
                    nobody would tell us anything. A very tough environment in which to work.
                    Terrible housing problems and shortages. We were dependent on food orders from
                    Denmark, and people flying in cheese from Paris and so forth. There was nothing
                    to eat in Algeria. I mean, aside from bread. They were even importing potatoes
                    and eggs. Algeria was the largest egg importer in the world in the 1970s. And
                    this is in a country which could be the market garden of Europe.</p>
                <p>My principal problem was trying to do something about the morale of my staff.
                    They all felt under siege. They all felt the Algerians were the enemy. I had
                    great work persuading people to be more patient and understanding and to try to
                    see the Algerian side of it and accentuate the positive and so forth.</p>
                <p>I also had to sort of start from scratch in terms of relations with Algeria. I
                    really had no opposite number here in Washington. They didn't send anybody
                    senior here to represent them. I worked very hard at this.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I had a good relationship with President Boumedienne, B-O-U- M-E-D-I-E-N-N-E,
                    largely because I spoke Arabic to him. This became a point of honor between us.
                    We never needed an interpreter, and he and I would sit and talk Arabic. When I
                    left to go to Lebanon in '77, he expressed appreciation for this. One time he
                    reportedly told his cabinet, “If the American Ambassador can speak Arabic, so
                    can you.” Realize that the Algerians had been brought up by the French to be
                    illiterate in all languages. Very few of them could speak correct Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give your evaluation of Boumedienne?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, he was not nearly as dour a figure as everybody thought. He
                    certainly took his ideological commitments very serious, but he had a sense of
                    humor. He would occasionally joke with me about something. Had a twinkle in his
                    eye. I liked him.</p>
                <p>He was direct. He would give you a straight answer as opposed to Morocco where
                    you never get a straight answer. The Algerians would come right out and tell
                    you, “No, I'm not going to do it.” The Moroccans would normally say, “Well, yes,
                    we will think about that,” or “We'll try to do it,” or “Yes, of course,” when
                    they have no intentions of doing it. With the Algerians, the answer is usually
                    no, but at least you know where you stand.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of sympathy for what Boumedienne was trying to do. I thought he made
                    a lot of mistakes in terms of economic planning. I didn't have any luck trying
                    to tell this to the Algerians. But he was overly ambitious, I think, in what he
                    was hoping to do for Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything outside of private American

                <p>PARKER: Yes, they are very interested in U.S. policy. But you see, in most
                    international fora, we and the Algerians would be on opposite sides of the line.
                    But no, they were not interested in U.S. aid. We couldn't give them
                    anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I worked very hard to try to get a medical exchange started. I had personal
                    interest in doing something to improve the quality of medical services in
                    Algeria since I was dependent on them. I worked very hard, both on the American
                    end and on the Algerian end, to get an exchange of physicians started. It got
                    started just as I left and then, I don't know why, it stopped after several
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why—again looking at it at that time—what was the
                        analysis of the embassy and your staff and yourself of why things didn't
                        work in Algeria? I mean, here it was an immensely rich country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Because of socialism. The idea of socialized agriculture is, you know, a
                    non-starter. Peasants are paid whether they work or not. And their pay consists
                    largely of chips which they can only use at the company store which doesn't have
                    anything in it except fly spray and laundry starch. The motivation for working
                    harder and producing more is not there. People simply didn't work. Agriculture
                    was the principal disaster area, but throughout industry, the same thing was
                    true. When you have a group of bureaucrats who are making decisions as to where
                    money is to be invested in what without really much regard to what their
                    economic realities are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that you were sort of an almost
                        onlooker as opposed to say to some other ambassadors? How about the French
                        or the Soviet ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. Nobody had any entr�e, any influence there. Least of all, the Soviet
                    who couldn't speak any language except Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't really feel that—I mean, this was a home-
                        brewed problem as far as . . . This was not the Soviets—</hi>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. The only foreigners who had any entr�e at all there were the Cubans
                    and perhaps the North Koreans. For some reason, Boumedienne, like Sadat at one
                    point, thought highly of Kim Il-Sung. He would keep telling me what a mistake we
                    were making in not cozying up to Kim Il-Sung.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I had better access to the Algerian government than the Soviet Ambassador.
                    Certainly than any of the bloc ambassadors except if you count Cuba and North
                    Korea in that category. They didn't have anything to offer.</p>
                <p>We worked with very simple things. I gave Boumedienne a moon rock. He liked that.
                    He liked things to do with space.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I went to someone like the Minister of Agriculture with a picture,
                    one of these Mars pictures that we had taken. There is this rocky landscape, and
                    I handed it off to him, and I said, “Where do you think that is taken?”</p>
                <p>He would say, “Oh, this town,” and he would name some place in the desert.</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, that comes from Mars.” It really impressed them.</p>
                <p>When you work at it, these personal contacts are terribly important, and they can
                    be effective when you want to get something done. You have got access.</p>
                <p>I made a vow—I didn't make a vow—I made a decision to—I was determined that I was
                    going to call on every cabinet minister. I forget how many there were. What
                    happened is that all requests for calls had to go through the Foreign Ministry.
                    The Foreign Ministry would make one appointment and return the note and that
                    would be the end of it. You know, you would ask for three or four at a time, you
                    would only get one. My other colleagues, after going through this a couple of
                    times, just gave up. Well, I kept at it. It took me nineteen months to call on
                    all the ministers. But I was the only ambassador who had done it.</p>
                <p>One time I am meeting with the Minister of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone. He
                    said, “Mr. Parker, I want you to know that we all appreciate your patience.” You
                    eventually build up a reputation in a place like Algiers. Everybody knows that
                    Parker has made this effort, and everybody in the cabinet has met him. He
                    persevered, and he's understood our problems. It's not that we are hostile or
                    inhospitable, we are just not very well organized. We would like to see him, and
                    we enjoy talking to him. That's the sort of level you are reduced to. We didn't
                    have anything to offer, anything material they wanted except some help
                    occasionally with contractors. I was called in a couple of times involved in
                    disputes with contractors, trying to straighten that out and trying to help
                    American contractors understand better the environment in which they were
                    working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much interest from Washington, from the
                        Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, a lot of interest because the Algerians were up to all sorts of
                    trouble. They were behind the big debate, the north-south dialogue about the
                    sharing of technology and capital and so forth. They were really in our hair all
                    over the place. The people in Washington were very irritated and very
                    interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how did this play out as far as you were
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I would simply go over to the Foreign Ministry and say, “All right
                    now, you've taken this position, and it's wrong. You ought to change.” Try to
                    persuade people that they ought to be more reasonable about accepting our point
                    of view. And they would give me theirs back, and I would send it off to
                    Washington and nothing much would happen. Neither side would change.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Kissinger moved Tom Enders out of the economic job and put Charles
                    Robinson in it and told him to take a more positive attitude towards this
                    north-south dialogue, which Robinson did. Robinson came out and made a couple of
                    visits to Algiers and this greatly improved the atmosphere. We were at least
                    willing to listen to them seriously and enter into a dialogue with them which we
                    had not been willing to do when Enders was Under Secretary for Economic
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other matters that concerned you there
                        particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, lots of matters. There was a time when every morning I would get up,
                    and I would say, “I don't mind if they send me out of here today.” I would get
                    called to the Presidency in the middle of the night. I would be taking my shower
                    usually when the telephone rang. “Get over here to the Presidency.” There were
                    terrible demands made on us by the environment there.</p>
                <p>But I look back on it now as one place where I think I was successful. I think
                    American-Algerian relations were considerably better when I left than they had
                    been when I came. I think I deserve a good deal of the credit for it. With very
                    little to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, should we—</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, we had finished our last interview where you had
                        left Algiers. I would like to ask you, how did you get the appointment to be
                        ambassador to Lebanon? And, let's see, that was in 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I went back to Washington at Christmas time in 1976 just after the
                    election because I wanted to spend Christmas with our family, and our oldest son
                    was getting married the day after Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the election in which Carter was elected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Carter had just been elected president.</p>
                <p>I came back and routinely called on the Under Secretary for Political Affairs,
                    who at that point was Phil Habib. I went to see him. Phil just gave me hell. He
                    was a terrible bully about things like this. He accused me of coming back,
                    contrary to instructions that had been sent to all posts in the field, that
                    nobody, no ambassador was to return to the United States during the transition
                    period because they didn't want people shopping around for jobs. He said I was
                    here shopping around for jobs. Well, that was nonsense. I told him why I had
                    come back, and he was very cynical about that. He browbeat me for a while.</p>
                <p>Then I went off and called on somebody in the Secretary's office—I forget who it
                    was now, whether it was the Deputy Secretary or what—but I was sitting in the
                    reception area outside the Secretary's office when Ghassan Tueni, the Lebanese
                    newspaper editor who has always been involved in foreign affairs—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: G-H-A-S-S-A-N T-U-E-N-I. Who was functioning as sort of a special
                    emissary for the new government in Lebanon led by President Sarkis, coming to
                    ask us to send them an ambassador. The last ambassador, Francis Malloy, had been
                    assassinated in June. We had seriously debated closing the post, but in the end
                    decided to keep it open with a charg� and a small staff for the time being. By
                    the end of the year, the Syrians had moved in and had restored a certain degree
                    of order. The Lebanese were saying, “Well, now we need a sign of confidence on
                    the part of the United States so that we can start the reconstruction process.
                    So send us an ambassador.”</p>
                <p>Tueni had called on the Secretary. He came out of the Secretary's office with I
                    think Roy Atherton and somebody else, and he spotted me out there, and we are
                    old friends. We had a brief conversation. He went off. I'm sure that Tueni
                    suggested because he knew me well, that I would be a good choice for the
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Well, we went off. We went out to San Francisco which was my home leave address
                    to see my mother and my brother. And then I began a tour across the United
                    States from San Francisco and ending up in Boston, passing by, let's see, San
                    Francisco, Houston, Chicago, New York, Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The direct route.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The direct route. I was on a speaking tour. I was speaking to American
                    firms doing business in Algeria talking to them about the problems of doing
                    business there, and giving them some ideas I had that might make their path a
                    little easier.</p>
                <p>In particular, I thought that they should be doing something about orienting
                    people, giving them a couple of weeks of exposure to some information about this
                    country before they went to it because it was a very difficult environment in
                    which to work. I was very disappointed by the performance of American companies
                    in this respect. They just hired any damn engineer off the street and sent him
                    to Algiers without giving him any idea of what he was getting into. It must have
                    been one of the most difficult places in the world to work. As the Czech
                    Ambassador, who was dean of the corps, used to say, “This is not a school of
                    patience, this is a university.” The Algerian bureaucracy was maddeningly
                    difficult to work with. I was counseling patience and some sophistication and
                    some learning.</p>
                <p>Before going off on this trip, before leaving Washington, I had seen Carol Laise,
                    who was the Director General, and she had asked me what my plans were. I said I
                    was going back to Algiers.</p>
                <p>She said, “Are you sure?”</p>
                <p>I said, Yes. That's my plan.”</p>
                <p>She said, “Well, you better go talk to Roy Atherton,” who was the Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>Roy told me that my name was among those who had been put forward to the White
                    House as a candidate for Beirut. I said I didn't want to go to Beirut and get
                    shot at. I had had enough danger in my life. He said he didn't enjoy
                    recommending friends to go to a place like that, but he thought with the Syrians
                    there, it would be secure.</p>
                <p>I went off, and I forgot about this. I was in Houston. I was in the office of a
                    senior executive of a company that has since gone broke—the name of which I
                    cannot remember. Sitting in his richly furnished office. The telephone rang, and
                    it was Roy Atherton, and he said that, “The President had decided to send you to
                    Beirut as his first ambassador.”</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>And I said, “Oh, shit.” That's just how I felt. Well, I continued the trip and
                    then came back and had a very suspenseful wait for the Senate to have their
                    confirmation hearings because the Department wanted me to get out there before
                    the Secretary got there. The Secretary was arriving on something like the
                    seventeenth of February. Secretary Vance. As it happened, we had time. We
                    originally thought we were going to have this hearing the second week in
                    January. We had prepared for it for a given day, for a Thursday. We were going
                    to go have lunch afterwards with Dayton Mak in Georgetown. Lunch or dinner, I
                    can't remember which. And then take the plane to Algiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I had to go to Algiers to say goodbye and pack and then go on to
                    Beirut. Well, that hearing was never held that day and so instead of staying for
                    lunch or dinner or whatever it was, we had to move in with the Mak's for a week,
                    because we had already moved out of Columbia Plaza and couldn't get back in. The
                    poor Mak's had to put us up for an extra week before we finally got off.</p>
                <p>I had three days in Algiers to say goodbye. I didn't have time to get sworn in
                    Washington. I got sworn in by our consular officer, Jim Ledesma, in the lobby of
                    the embassy in Algiers. Then I went off to Beirut.</p>
                <p>I arrived there the thirteenth. I presented my credentials on the fourteenth. The
                    Secretary arrived on the fifteenth or seventeenth—I forget which.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Secretary doing on that trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: This was his first visit to the area. The area was obviously one of high
                    priority, and he wanted to come out and see what was going on and get a feel for
                    the situation. The administration was considering—I'm not sure whether they were
                    considering at that point—but they knew about this study done by the Brookings
                    Institution on a comprehensive Arab- Israel settlement. They were very
                    interested in trying to do something about it. In contrast to the Ford
                    Administration which had concentrated on this little step-by-step approach.</p>
                <p>Vance came out with a large entourage and made a quick trip. Had lunch with the
                    president. Came in the morning, left that evening. Didn't spend the night.
                    Everybody was scared that, you know, somebody was going to take a shot at him. I
                    must say Beirut in these days was a very hairy place.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Very heavy security precautions. I had a minimum team when we moved off. When my
                    wife and I and our guards went some place visiting, there were thirteen people
                    in three cars. People carrying Uzis and sawed-off shotguns and big shotguns and
                    any weapon you can think of. Eventually, I had three American guards as well as
                    my Lebanese guards.</p>
                <p>We lived, first of all, in an apartment down in town near the embassy. We had the
                    Marines in there. The Marines were under instructions to be with us all the
                    time. About the only place we could be without the Marines standing around
                    watching us was in the bathroom or the bedroom. In fact, they were in the
                    bedroom next to ours sleeping there. Absolutely no privacy.</p>
                <p>That was relaxed a little bit after a while. We moved up to the residence on the
                    hill, which is at Yarze which is still being occupied by the ambassador although
                    it has been hit a number of times by shells.</p>
                <p>We moved out in the late summer of 1978 after a very difficult night in which one
                    of our American bodyguards almost got killed by a shot outside our bedroom door.
                    One of the Marines was out in the garden, and a mortar shell landed there and
                    knocked him down. He was in a state of shock all evening. He came bursting into
                    our bedroom and ordered my wife and me to get up and get out and to put on our
                    gas masks and go downstairs to the wine cellar. We didn't have a shelter. But on
                    the first floor, there was one room with no windows where we kept wine and food.
                    I told him to take it easy and at least let me get my clothes on, which I
                    did.</p>
                <p>The next morning, the security officer came and said, “You know, you really can't
                    stay up here. It's not fair to your staff to have them running back and forth
                    between town and here through all these dangers with messages and so forth.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You are right.” We moved down into an apartment in the embassy and
                    stayed there until we left.</p>
                <p>It was a very exciting post. Everything since Beirut has been anti-climax.</p>

                    including heavy artillery and tanks. You had, first of all, what became the
                    Lebanese forces, the Maronite, the Christian force. Perhaps eight or
                    ten-thousand men armed with weapons supplied by various places including the
                    Israelis. The Israelis had had a liaison arrangement with these people for
                    almost thirty years at that point. That was the only Christian militia.</p>
                <p>On the Moslem side, you had Kamal Jumblatt, the leader of the Druze, who was
                    assassinated shortly after I arrived and succeeded by his son, Walid. That's
                    Jumblatt, J-U-M-B-L-A-T-T, Kamal, K-A-M-A-L, and Walid, W-A-L-I-D. All right.
                    Kamal Jumblatt led this force of Druze warriors that owed feudal loyalty to him.
                    I don't know, there were somewhere between five and ten-thousand men. They were
                    mostly up in the Shuf mountains.</p>
                <p>In the town of Beirut, you had a Moslem militia. They called them murabitun which
                    was very small and ill-formed in West Beirut. You had very heavy Palestine
                    Liberation forces of various factions including Saiqa, S-A-I-Q-A, which was
                    controlled by the Syrians. And what we called El Fatah. The real name was Fath,
                    F-A-T-H, but everybody spells it F-A-T-A-H. Saiqa and Fatah were the two
                    strongest Palestinian forces.</p>
                <p>The Shia at that point had a very small, embryonic militia which was not of any
                    importance on the local scene.</p>
                <p>It was a terrifying site to drive around Beirut. You would see these young,
                    fourteen, fifteen-year-old boys with AK- 47s and bandoleers of ammunition around
                    their shoulders, obviously ready to shoot at anybody.</p>
                <p>The Lebanese have always liked to shoot. You see sometimes in the television news
                    a fighter standing out in the street, and he's got this submachine gun and just
                    is pointing it off in the general direction of somebody and pulling the trigger.
                    He's not aiming at anyone. They were highly inaccurate. You would see the side
                    of a building that had been largely destroyed, pock-marked with holes coming
                    from automatic weapons, a machine gun of some sort. Just hundreds and hundreds
                    of them across the wall, nothing apparently going through the window. Of course,
                    it wouldn't leave any mark if it had. Wildly inaccurate shooting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: These people were all subsidized. Subsidized by the Israelis, by wealthy
                    American Maronites, by wealthy Moslems, by the PLO, by the Iraqis, by the
                    Syrians, by the Saudis, by the Kuwaitis. I don't know. This was an industry,
                    being a fighter. I mean, one of the principal sources of employment. People got
                    paid a pretty good wage by Lebanese standards for this. I forget what it was,
                    but it was quite respectable. You could support a family on this. The danger was
                    not all that great. Most of the casualties were civilians. The military
                    casualties were very limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was causing this? I hesitate to open this particular
                        can of worms, but I think you have to explain what were some of the forces
                        that were going on with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, that's a question of discussing the political dynamics of Lebanon
                    which is something that really needs a whole interview. But very briefly,
                    Lebanon existed under a very delicate balance which was based on a gentlemen's
                    agreement which itself was based on a legal fiction that the Christians were a
                    majority. All jobs and influence were distributed on the basis what was called
                    the dosage. Dosage is spelled D-O-S-A-G-E, it's a French term meaning the dose.
                    That is, what was the percentage of people of a given sect in the population.
                    The legal fiction was that everything should be divided on the basis of six
                    Christians to five Moslems. The parliament, for instance, always has to be a
                    multiple of nine. I'm sorry, of eleven. You have to have six Christian seats and
                    five Moslem seats.</p>
                <p>There are sixteen recognized sects, Christian and Moslem. Each sect, down to and
                    including the Protestants, is entitled to some representation in parliament and
                    in jobs throughout the bureaucracy, which are handed out on the basis of this
                    sectarian affiliation. Confessionalisme is the French word for it.</p>
                <p>The President of the Republic is always Maronite. The Speaker of the House, which
                    would be the second ranking position in terms of protocol, is a Shia, S-H-I-A or
                    S-H-I-I. And the Prime Minister is Sunni, S-U-N-N-I, Moslem. Somebody who by
                    virtue of his position is behind the president in power. The president has
                    extraordinary powers including the ability to legislate by decree. He can decree
                    a law. And if the parliament doesn't overturn it within a fixed period—I think
                    it's sixty days—it becomes law. What Ronny Reagan couldn't have done with
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>This system worked pretty well. It was held together by the tension between these
                    sects which prevented any one of them from really dominating the others. I mean,
                    the Maronites were first. They had more power than the others, but it wasn't all
                    that much more. But they were balanced off by the other sects in any event.
                    That's sects, S-E-C-T-S, not S-E-X. They governed by what I called Draconian
                    gimmick. You didn't pass legislation or pass laws to do directly what you
                    wanted. You imposed some sort of a penalty.</p>
                <p>I remember once going to the president with a delegation from the World Bank, and
                    we had a proposal for some low cost housing which was very much needed in
                    Beirut. The American government and the World Bank were prepared to support it.
                    And President Sarkis, S-A-R-K-I-S, said he didn't want to have anything to do
                    with it. He wasn't going to make a decision as to who was going to get these
                    houses. However he made the decision, it would be challenged, and people would
                    fight about it.</p>
                <p>It was much better just to let the neutral forces of the market determine who was
                    going to get what house. What you do is you set interest rates. You made money
                    available in the form of funds for loans. You gave cheap loans, and you let
                    people come and borrow money. Those who could would, and they would put up
                    houses, and if they weren't going to live in it themselves, they would rent it
                    to somebody else who could afford it. This would all work out in the end. Much
                    more satisfactory than if the government tried to say, “Okay, everybody with
                    income of less than five-thousand pounds is going to be eligible for one of
                    these houses, and we are going to start doing this on an alphabetical basis,” or
                    whatever. However they chose to do it, they would be in trouble. So they always
                    looked for some neutral way to do this.</p>
                <p>When they wanted to, as opposed to giving out rewards, when they wanted to impose
                    penalties, they would have to have some way that was non-political of doing
                    this. Everybody was related to a member of parliament. Any attempt to give
                    anybody a ticket was always sort of futile because nobody would pay it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a traffic ticket.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: A traffic ticket. So what they did was you have the system that we have
                    here in Washington, D.C. at the moment. The policeman would note down your
                    number, and he wouldn't even bother to give you a piece of paper. He would just
                    file this away. At the end of the day, he would say, “Well, this car, this
                    number, went through a red light at one- fifteen p.m.,” and that would be put
                    against your plate. And when it came time to renew that plate, you couldn't
                    renew it unless you paid off these fines.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Same thing with taxes. No tax collector would go out. They wouldn't take you to
                    court about it, but you would find that if you hadn't paid your taxes—and
                    everybody evaded taxes to the maximum possible extent—that if you hadn't paid
                    your taxes and you wanted a license to import something, you couldn't get it
                    until you paid off the tax bill.</p>
                <p>A system which was full of holes. In many respects, worked very badly, and in
                    other respects, worked very well. It was a crazy sort of place in which you
                    could do anything. Buy anything. Any kind of sex you wanted, any kind of drug,
                    any kind of food, any kind of car, any kind of entertainment, any kind of house.
                    You could live better in Beirut than you could any place in the world as far as
                    I was concerned. It was really a swinging town. We had been there in the early
                    sixties as I said earlier and enjoyed it greatly.</p>
                <p>Well, this wonderful, bizarre mechanism had come apart under the weight of, first
                    of all, the Palestinian armed presence. When King Hussein finally moved against
                    the PLO in Jordan in 1970—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Black September.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Black September. Something that Harry Symmes has described in his oral
                    history.</p>
                <p>The people moved to Lebanon and set up this state within a state in southern
                    Lebanon which became the nearest thing they had to a homeland. They would attack
                    the Israelis. And the Israelis would come over and bomb the Lebanese. This
                    became an intolerable situation for the Lebanese. The Israelis were trying to
                    force them into doing something about the Palestinians, but they couldn't
                    because the Palestinians were primarily Moslem. This became a matter of
                    religious solidarity between Lebanese Moslems and Palestinians. Lebanese
                    Moslems, in general, supported the Palestinians. The Maronites in particular
                    opposed them. And the army being divided between Christians and Moslems was
                    unreliable. They weren't going to shoot at fellow Moslems. And so the army
                    couldn't be used. The state was unable to cope with this.</p>
                <p>This problem was aggravated by the economic and social inequalities that had
                    built up in this country. Particularly between the north and the south. The Shia
                    in the south were neglected and very little was done for them. They were behind
                    everybody else in terms of literacy and education and wealth and property and in
                    any way you want to look at it. Social graces and so forth. But they were the
                    most prolific part of the population, and they were by the mid-1970s, probably
                    the largest Moslem sect in the country. They were crowded into what was called
                    the Belt of Poverty around Beirut. A collection of lower class housing, poor
                    sanitation, and so forth. Sort of amalgamated with these three refugee camps of
                    Tall Za'tar, Sabra and Shatila, S-H-A-T-I-L-A. To western observers, a constant
                    potential source of trouble. They indeed provided a majority of the fighters in
                    the Moslem militias.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Well, this was a very unstable situation. The Syrians had decided—correctly in my
                    view—that the only way you were going to bring this situation under control was
                    to disarm the militias. Every family in Lebanon had an automatic weapon. The
                    Syrians were going to go out and collect them. They were going to start with two
                    refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila, in Beirut which were strongly fortified by the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, we are talking about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I am talking about when I arrived in Beirut on the thirteenth of
                    February.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I mean, they hadn't started this yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, they hadn't started yet. They were moving tanks up, and they were
                    going to move, I believe, the next day. The fourteenth or fifteenth I guess it
                    was. Vance was arriving the seventeenth. They were going to move in the camps on
                    the fifteenth, or something like that.</p>
                <p>We urged them to delay this for a week because we knew that there would be
                    serious fighting when this happened, and we didn't want it to ruin Vance's
                    visit. We wanted to get him in and out of Beirut before this happened. So we put
                    pressure on them. The French did. The Lebanese did. The PLO did. They postponed
                    it for a week, and they never did it. They lost momentum, and it never got done.
                    These militias have never been disarmed, and until they are, you will have no
                    peace in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>My mission in this place was sort of, you know, nobody ever told me what the hell
                    to do. It was to go out there and be the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is something that as we have worked on these oral
                        histories, it's a question I ask every ambassador. What were your
                        instructions? And I usually get either a very blank look or say, “Well, you
                        just go out and be an ambassador.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: That's right. No, what they said was, “We are behind you all the way. Get
                    out there and see what you can do to bring this place together.” I saw my
                    function as helping to bind up the wounds of war. When I arrived, I made a noble
                    statement about the period of reconstruction had arrived now. And conciliation.
                    And it was time for everybody to work together to put Lebanon back on the
                    road.</p>
                <p>Well, we worked on this very hard. AID came in and put up some warehouses down in
                    the port to replace those that had been destroyed in the fighting. We got the
                    port operating again.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We were making progress in a lot of fields: Economically, training the army,
                    bringing in military equipment. I could bring in anything I wanted to for the
                    army, anything they could absorb, anything they wanted, I should say. I had sort
                    of carte blanche in terms of requesting support in that respect if in my
                    judgment they could use it. I could not, on the other hand, give one single
                    cartridge to the police because of this terrible State of Siege law coming out
                    of the Yves Montand movie.</p>

                    South Americans by AID and CIA. As though we could teach those people anything
                    about torture. There was a great revulsion against our aid to police forces
                    because of this and legislation was passed—I don't know what it was called, but
                    we all called it the state of siege law which, in effect, prevented us from
                    giving any aid to the police.</p>
                <p>Well, the Lebanese internal security forces were police forces. They had two
                    types of police. They had the police who were town police, and they had the
                    gendarmerie who were countryside police. And the gendarmerie in particular was
                    the principal force for order in that country. Unless you had a gendarme in the
                    village, you would have no control over it. But if you did have a gendarme, you
                    could have a certain degree of order.</p>
                <p>Well, we couldn't do anything at all for the gendarmerie, which was too bad,
                    because that was a force that could have done something concrete towards
                    restoring order. And would not have been troubled by the confessional problems,
                    the religious problems that you had in the army because you are talking about
                    much smaller, infinitesimally smaller units. And you have a Moslem gendarme in a
                    Moslem village. And there was no problem. A Christian in a Christian
                    village.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We were making progress, as I said. President Sarkis said on one occasion, “For
                    every two steps forwards, we are making one backwards, but at least we are
                    making that progress.” This lasted for about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, I want to go back right to the
                        beginning. You said that because of Vance's visit, you put pressure on the
                        Syrians—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not to launch this attack to get the weapons. Now, you
                        said Vance came in. I can understand your position, but do you think this
                        is—I mean, here we have the Secretary of State who hasn't been to the area
                        comes in essentially for a lunch. Flies out again. We tell the Syrians to
                        stop something which may have actually had a significant affect on it. I
                        mean, were there other factors or was the Vance visit, which sounds like in
                        the greater scale of things, a pretty puny event to stop a major
                        action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, we would have been better off to postpone the Vance visit. To
                    postpone everything. We didn't realize that the Syrians couldn't postpone it for
                    a week, that they would lose momentum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well it was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: This was a miscalculation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: But the Vance visit, the concern was security. Before he arrived, I was
                    getting all sorts of messages sort of saying, “On your head be it if anything
                    happens to Vance.” Or, “Do you think the situation is safe for him?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there pressures on you to get Vance in there? Or did
                        you want to have him come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, yes, sure I wanted to have him come in. It would be a big boost to
                    me in terms of starting out my tour there and would be very helpful for me and
                    the Secretary to sit down and talk to the president. Sort of establish that I
                    was in good standing in Washington and would give the Secretary a firsthand view
                    of what was going on there which is more much important actually than my status.
                    I think the educational impact on him was what I would consider the most
                    important. Unfortunately, he didn't see much, and he didn't really get much of
                    an earful or eyeful. He came back once more during my tour for a similar visit
                    with similar results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we even talking to the Syrians? I mean, were we able
                        to have any influence with the Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, we had relatively good relations with the Syrians at that point. We
                    had an aid program in Syria. Dick Murphy had access. He was the ambassador in
                    Damascus. He could see senior officials, and they would listen to him. We had
                    tacitly accepted entry into Lebanon in 1976. We had acted, in effect, as
                    intermediaries between them and the Israelis about this move in. Sort of getting
                    Israeli acquiescence. We stood in pretty good odor with them at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sorry to interrupt. You were back saying that the
                        situation where you were working lasted about a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. And then the Maronite militia, the Lebanese Forces which is simply
                    an enlarged Phalanges, P-H-A-L- A-N-G-E-S, which was a neo-fascist organization
                    founded by Pierre Gemayel, G-E-M-A-Y-E-L, the father of the Bashir, B-A-S-H-I-R,
                    and Amin, A-M-I-N, Gemayel, the two successive presidents of Lebanon.</p>
                <p>The Lebanese forces were commanded by Bashir Gemayel, who looked like a pussycat,
                    but was a ruthless cutthroat, completely immoral in terms of attaining his
                    political objectives. He was bent on becoming president of Lebanon. He came to
                    see me at my residence in December of '77 and said he was about to move on the
                    presidential palace which was about two-hundred yards down the road from us. And
                    he was going to take over. I told him not to be a damn fool. We weren't going to
                    support that, and neither would anybody else. That this was no time to be
                    engaging in foolishness of this sort. He was very disappointed, and he went
                    away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He thought that you would give support to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, he had because he had been misled I think by Charles Malik, who had
                    kept coming back here and seeing Vance and other people and going back to
                    Lebanon and saying, “Parker doesn't know what he is talking about. Parker is
                    pro-Syrian—Vance is with us—”.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charles Malik.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Charles Malik was a former Lebanese Foreign Minister, former permanent
                    representative to the United Nations. Perhaps one of the best known Lebanese
                    statesman, who died fairly recently. A Greek Orthodox from northern Lebanon. A
                    man of great intellect and even greater ego who was, I found, a very destructive
                    influence in Lebanon in the time I was there. Where were we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was asking why Gemayel thought he could move his
                        troops and why we would give him support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Okay, that's right. A couple months later in February—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '78.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: February of '78. Suddenly, there was a skirmish at the Lebanese military
                    academy which was just over the hill from us on the Damascus Road at a place
                    called Fayadiyah, F-A-Y-A-D-I-Y-A-H. A number of Syrian soldiers, who had
                    maintained a roadblock on the Damascus Road near the school, were shot and
                    killed. The Lebanese then went on a rampage killing Syrians. The Syrians were
                    losing something like three men a day, and they couldn't take that sitting down.
                    They responded by shelling Beirut. Much as they were shelling it a couple weeks
                    ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about in 1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Shelling indiscriminately. I mean, shelling a particular part, the
                    Christian part of Beirut. In plain daylight. We had a visiting American military
                    team when I had half the senior officers in the Lebanese army up for lunch. The
                    Ministry of Defense was just up the hill from us. They came down the hill for
                    lunch. We all stood out on the terrace of the residence and watched a Syrian
                    rocket battery down at Sinn Al-Fil from the other side of Damascus highway. Sinn
                    Al-Fil, S-I-N-N A-L hyphen F-I-L. We watched this battery constantly firing at
                    Ashrafiyah, the Christian section. These Lebanese officers were besides
                    themselves with frustration because they couldn't stop them.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The Syrians theoretically were under the command of President Sarkis, under the
                    command of the Lebanese. But the Lebanese had no authority over them. They were
                    throwing their weight around, and they showed no sophistication, no
                    discrimination between doing nothing and then shooting everybody in sight. They
                    didn't have any sort of middle ground.</p>
                <p>The situation then began going downhill. And it has been going downhill ever
                    since with a few respites of shorter or longer duration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the questions that I think anybody who looks at
                        Lebanon ask, is this because of the very unique elements within this society
                        that this place has become the closest thing to hell that one can think of.
                        I mean, unrelenting war that has gone on with no solution in sight. Or is it
                        really a tie to the Middle East and the Middle East problem, or is it
                        unique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, it's unique in the sense that the Lebanese have always enjoyed a
                    certain degree of anarchy. Mount Lebanon was a refuge area difficult to get to.
                    The tribes that sought refuge up there were able to maintain a degree of
                    independence that other people in the Middle East were not. The exception to
                    that is the Kurds. To a certain extent, the Armenians. Kurds and the
                    Lebanese—the mountain people were able—like mountaineers in most places—because
                    of the terrain were hard to get at; it's fairly easy for them to escape from a
                    pursuer—there is a long tradition of mountaineering independence. And these
                    people who are fighting today are mountaineers who have come down from the
                    hills, and they are living on the plain now, but they think they are a bunch of
                    mountain boys.</p>
                <p>It is complicated by the fact that, as I've said earlier, nobody takes Lebanon
                    seriously. Just about everybody has dabbled in Lebanese politics to a greater or
                    lesser extent including ourselves, the Israelis, the Soviets, the British, the
                    French, the Saudis, the Turks, the Iraqis. Everybody who has any interest in
                    that area has got some clients in Lebanon. The Lebanese love this. They love to
                    have somebody protecting them, and they feel they can go out and do whatever
                    they like and get away with it. And there are certain people who consider
                    themselves to be our clients. This is to a certain extent a hangover from the
                    period of the capitulations, of extraterritorial status which the citizens of
                    western powers enjoyed under the Turkish, under the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The prot�g�s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Prot�g�, yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. If they don't have a protecting power, they will go out and seek
                    one. As long as people were not armed, this was fairly benign. It was considered
                    funny that nobody was paying much attention to the laws. There were certain
                    basic laws. Laws relating to business crime were very strict. You had to keep
                    your word in a business transaction. This was a commercial society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Levant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, this is the Levant. This is glorious free private enterprise carried
                    to its logical conclusion. If you were a merchant, your word was your bond. But
                    if you were a politician or a lawyer or something else, you could get away with
                    just about anything. Let's see, where was I?</p>
                <p>When the French came in, they did what they did every place in North Africa and
                    elsewhere. They prohibited rifled weapons. Couldn't own a rifled weapon.
                    R-I-F-L-E-D. That is, a weapon which put a spin on the bullets so that they will
                    go a longer distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, allowing the hunter to have his shotgun to
                        shoot rabbits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He could have a shotgun to shoot rabbits, but he couldn't have anything
                    with long range. So that you couldn't sit on top of your mountain and kill
                    people in the valley down below. People had shotguns, and they had very little
                    ammunition for them. Every Lebanese worth his salt had a pistol, but he couldn't
                    hit anything with it. It was, you know, no bigger than a thirty-eight at the
                    most. The amount of trouble that could be caused was limited. But by 1975-76,
                    people were heavily armed, heavily supplied with ammunition, and the
                    possibilities for trouble were enormous. And they greatly outnumbered the army
                    in numbers and in fire power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your position and from the State Department position,

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. We were, in fact, we sort of connived at this because at one point
                    the Christians came to us and said, “We are running out of ammunition. If you
                    and the Israelis don't do something quickly, we are going to be slaughtered by
                    Jumblatt. We, in effect, connived that the Israelis resupply the Maronites.</p>

                    Israelis about this. Kissinger was involved. This was Kissinger's decision that
                    we should agree to this resupply, and if necessary, assist with it. At this
                    point, I forget the details of what we did. But I know that we were in
                    accord.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, well, no. We had done it before. In '77, the Israelis were still
                    supplying arms to the Maronites. You know, at any given time—I don't know what
                    this particular declaration is referring to, I would have to look up the
                    telegrams—but probably I can imagine it's the arrival of a shipload of old
                    Sherman tanks that they are turning over to the Maronites. And this had been
                    picked up by the press or somebody, and somebody is making an issue of it.</p>

                        as from your observation point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I had a very—what shall I say— difficult time. There was the usual
                    problem that we and Tel Aviv didn't see things the same way. Sam Lewis and I had
                    quite different views of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was our ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>PARKER: He was our ambassador in Tel Aviv. And that's sort of normal. In this
                    case, I was particularly disturbed that we were, in effect, acquiescing in
                    Israeli hegemony over southern Lebanon. And part of our saying that we—and we
                    said this repeatedly—that we support the territorial integrity of Lebanon, and
                    we fully support the central government. We were not willing to say, “No,” to
                    the Israelis to get the hell out of south Lebanon. And they were supporting this
                    renegade down there, Major Haddad, who had armed a little strip of Maronite
                    villages along the border that he had organized against the Shia and against the
                    Palestinians in a sort of a village defense effort. I can sympathize with that,
                    but what it meant was that—I mean, the way to deal with that problem was not to
                    arm the villagers, but to get the Lebanese army down there and get in control of
                    this area so it could police and defend it against the Palestinians which I
                    think it would have done. But between the Israelis and the reluctance of the
                    Lebanese to really take any strong measures in this respect, Lebanon lost
                    control of southern Lebanon, and it's been a continuing source of problems.</p>

                <p>PARKER: We have enormous influence in Lebanon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, we have no strategic or material interest in Lebanon. There is an
                    American university there with a first-class hospital that's very important. But
                    it's important really to Lebanon and to the area, it's not of any great
                    intrinsic importance to the United States. It makes us feel good to support it.
                    We think we are doing something positive. It's the one positive thing we are
                    doing in Lebanon. I mean, that we can point to. And this seems to have worked.
                    We have tried a lot of other things, but none of them seem to have worked very
                    well.</p>
                <p>I personally feel that the area has been rather successful in quarantining
                    Lebanon and isolating this illness, but we are never going to bring the
                    terrorism problem under control until there is peace in Lebanon. As long as the
                    terrorists can move in and out of there at will as they do, there is going to be
                    no way of getting them. The only way you are going to control the terrorists in
                    the end is by having responsible governments that will suppress and control
                    them.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Well, not so much that as we simply weren't going to cross the Israelis.
                    It wasn't worth it. The Israelis had too much support in our Congress. If the
                    Lebanese had been more resolute and better organized, and we had some chance of
                    showing some positive accomplishment if we could get the Israelis to withdraw, I
                    think we would have acted differently. But the Lebanese were such wimps that we
                    weren't going to take the risk of confronting Israel and a hostile Congress. I
                    mean, this is in a period when the Israelis controlled seventy-six senators, and
                    we weren't going to take them on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Lebanese-Americans? There is a sizable group of
                        Lebanese and always has been in the United States. Did they play much of a

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I would say a largely destructive role.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Destructive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Destructive. The Lebanese have brought their feuds with them to the
                    United States. They have been badly divided by the same religious divisions that
                    divide them in Lebanon. The Maronites are interested in the Maronites, and the
                    Druze in the Druze, and so forth, quite naturally. Each one has sought to push
                    the interests of its own sect. The Maronites have been the most effective in
                    this. Some day I think some of these people are going to have a lot to answer
                    for if the real history of this era is ever written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am speaking now maybe a little bit nuts and bolts, but
                        did you ever get involved in major consular problems there because it would
                        strike me that this would be a place where you would have a lot of—if not
                        just straight Americans, Lebanese- Americans—who have gotten in trouble in a
                        difficult place in getting them out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We had a lot of problems. In '76 I believe, '75 or '76, we moved our
                    consular operations out of Beirut during the first phase of the civil war. We
                    moved the files to various places, and Lebanese would have to go to Athens or
                    Cyprus or I think maybe they could go to Damascus or Amman to get visas and
                    passport services. We just sort of reconstituted the consular section when I got
                    there. We built it up and began performing consular functions. We gradually
                    brought the files back. This was part of the reconstruction effort. I don't know
                    what we are doing today. I imagine we have moved them back out again.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>My experiences is the worst problems are not with the foreign-born Americans, not
                    with the Lebanese-Americans in Lebanon. It's with the American-Americans in
                    Lebanon who have been there too long. Those are the people who end up as
                    hostages. Those are the people who don't have enough sense to leave the country
                    when they are told to. And they are the ones who are conspicuous and who get
                    robbed and lose their passports and so forth. The Lebanese-Americans, in my
                    experience, were pretty self-reliant. Most of the American-Americans had shipped
                    out in '76. There were very few of them left there when we got there. There had
                    been a large American community. Very few of them remained. Those that did were
                    by and large pretty self-reliant. We had exported most of the consular problems
                    by then.</p>
                <p>We were giving special status to Lebanese visa applicants. They were all sort of
                    automatically eligible for asylum for a period there. At other Foreign Service
                    posts other than Beirut we issued a great many visas. That also cleared up a lot
                    of problems that we might otherwise have had. We had taken care of a good part
                    of the demand. We didn't have the long lines that we've had in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about from the desk now? I mean, without really any
                        instructions, were you getting mixed signals? Was there a clear policy? This
                        is the Carter administration. The time of Camp David getting underway and
                        all that. Did Lebanon play any role really in sort of Middle East
                        considerations or was this considered too difficult to deal with, you were
                        left with the problem yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the issue really got critical in '82, well after I had left, four
                    years after I had left, when we tied progress in Lebanon to progress on the
                    Arab-Israel question.</p>
                <p>At the time I was there, there was a certain amount of polite attention paid to
                    Lebanon, but it was not regarded as a player of any influence. When there was
                    talk of a Geneva conference which preceded and precipitated Sadat's trip to
                    Jerusalem, the Lebanese were very anxious to be invited to Geneva. They felt
                    they had an interest in this, and they wanted to take part in it. And we said,
                    “Of course, you will be invited.” But we didn't really see that they were going
                    to play a major role in it. I think that the interests of other parties, notably
                    Syria and Israel, really took precedence in the minds of the United States over
                    those of Lebanon.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Well, you know, you said earlier that we didn't want to cross the Israelis. We
                    also didn't want to cross the Syrians. Of course, we thought, I thought that the
                    Syrian presence there was essential to maintaining security. I thought, the
                    Foreign Minister thought, the President of Lebanon thought that if you pull the
                    Syrians out, we are going to have chaos here. The fighting is going to resume
                    immediately. It's the only police force we've got. The only reasonable
                    substitute for it is a reconstituted Lebanese army. I don't know how much ink
                    has been spilled on that over the years and how many visits and promises and
                    oaths and so forth have been made and exchanged and given, but we are no closer
                    today than we were when we started in 1977 in having an effective Lebanese
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in a way, almost all parties kind of wanted to keep
                        Lebanon isolated from—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Nobody knew what to do about it. They just wanted to make sure it

                        politics, but you would report to Washington. Would anybody, I mean other
                        than the man or woman who had to read the reports, I mean really be able to
                        do anything except, “My God, it's a complicated situation”? Or did they just
                        concentrate on the Israeli problem dealing with the other Arab states?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I think a lot of people felt sorry for me, but I have always been
                    known for my telegraphic style. My telegrams were always read by people. They
                    were always looking for the hidden joke in it. I think it was Harold Nicholson
                    said, “One way to ensure that your telegrams are read is to have a sense of
                    humor, but it's less likely to ensure that they are going to be taken
                    seriously.”</p>
                <p>At one point, I know that the Deputy Secretary, Mr. Christopher, had concluded
                    that I really wasn't a serious person, and he was very upset by some of the
                    things I had said in my telegrams. But at this point, I felt that I really
                    didn't care. I was in that country risking my life every day. I was going to
                    engage in all the gallows humor I wanted to. I was going to say things that I
                    had on my chest and to hell with what anybody else thought. My staff was
                    instructed to stop me if I went too far. And some of them are better at that
                    than others. I've since read a number of these telegrams in the Department, and
                    I put an awful lot of words is all I can say. There is a great historical record
                    there for somebody, but they are going to have to dig through a mountain of
                    verbiage.</p>

                        Service Officer?” Really right at the top or almost equal to analytical
                        ability is a sense of humor for the most part. Otherwise, I mean, this gets
                        you through a lot of situations and gives you a certain amount of

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I was guided by Eisenhower's dictum that, “Always take your job but
                    never yourself seriously.” But, of course, the obverse of that is that if you
                    don't take yourself seriously, nobody else will. But I tried to maintain sort of
                    a, you know, philosophical view of what was going on and to see the absurdity of
                    what was being said and what was being done.</p>
                <p>There wasn't much the Department could do. A. The only thing I can fault them for
                    really was this toleration of the Israeli incursions into Lebanon. We were very
                    wimpish about that, particularly in 1978, when we made a real effort to try to
                    send Lebanese troops to the south, and we were balked by the Israelis, and
                    Washington just did nothing about it. It really was very disappointing to

                    staff. People that in any normal service should have been selected out. One of
                    them at least I heard was subsequently. People who were, you know, trying to get
                    away from their wives. They said it was because they needed the money to buy
                    special education for their child or something like that. But what it really was
                    they wanted to go and live with a mama-san in Beirut or some place like

                <p>PARKER: I asked for an officer to replace one that was leaving, and the only
                    officer that they could come up with the qualifications was somebody who had
                    been there before and whose purpose in coming we realized after he had got there
                    was to take up with a Lebanese girlfriend leaving a wife and family back here in
                    the United States. He got in trouble with my successor very quickly. He was
                    moved on.</p>
                <p>We had some very good people, some very good administrative people. I had the
                    best security people I've ever had. This is sort of a rare bird in the security
                    field, but I had a very good security team. I had an administrative officer, a
                    couple of administrative officers who were first- class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who are these, the administrative officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, the first one was Chuck Baquet. The other was Robert Waska. Had a
                    very good aid officer who was very hard working and effective.</p>
                <p>I had a defense attach� whom I liked very much. I was very fond of him personally
                    but who was forever putting his foot into it with the Lebanese. The Foreign
                    Minister was always complaining about things that he had said. And I was always
                    having to defend him, and the Foreign Minister didn't understand the context and
                    so forth. He was a source of difficulty.</p>
                <p>I had a good deputy Chief of Mission, George Lane, who went on to be ambassador
                    to Yemen. He was a very solid and reassuring sort of fellow to have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it would make sense now to move to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well, let's just explain the story of my departure. When I went out
                    to Beirut, I said I would go for eighteen months, and at the end of eighteen
                    months, I wanted the option of deciding whether or not I wanted to leave. It was
                    very stressful. As a cardiac patient, I felt I didn't know how long I was going
                    to last in this situation.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of fifteen months in April or May, the people we thought killed
                    Meloy, my predecessor, said that they were gunning for me. In spite of the
                    security precautions, anybody who really wanted to get me could. If they really
                    had the intelligence and the determination, they could get at me. The Secretary
                    was very concerned about security, my security, and so were the security people.
                    I had a very high profile. I was every where, and I was on the radio, and I was
                    in the press, and on the television, and so forth. It was sort of diplomacy as
                    theater, sort of an act.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I came home myself on consultation in May of 1978 and said that I would like to
                    move on. I didn't want to leave at the end of eighteen months, but I thought two
                    years which would be February of 1979 would be about the right time. Harry
                    Barnes, the Director General, asked me if I was serious. I said, “Yes.” So then
                    I was asked where I would like to go. I said, “Where can I go?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Any where you like.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I would like to go some place in Europe.”</p>
                <p>“Well, there is nothing open in Europe. There are two posts coming open, Rabat
                    and Tunis.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I have been to Rabat. I would much rather go to Tunis.”</p>
                <p>But the Department, in its wisdom, decided to send me to Rabat thinking they were
                    doing me a favor. I left to go back to Beirut from consultation thinking I was
                    going to Tunis in the following spring.</p>
                <p>What happened was the Department pulled me out and sent me to Rabat in October.
                    Sooner than I was ready to go and quite unwillingly. I didn't like the way the
                    king treated ambassadors. Rabat is not an interesting town. I didn't want to go
                    back. I didn't really know that I was the man for the job, and I wasn't because
                    it turned out very badly. The king, after initially giving agr�ment, apparently
                    didn't realize that I had been there during the two previous coup d'�tat
                    attempts in which he suspected the Americans had some role. I think he became
                    convinced that I had been sent by Jimmy Carter to pull the plug out from under
                    him as he thought Jimmy Carter had done with the Shah.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Shah of Iran, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just about that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, in early 1979, he arrived in Rabat essentially as a refugee. To make
                    a long story short, in effect, the king asked for my recall, and I left there in
                    June of '78—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: '79 after eight months. And that was, in effect, the end of my
                    career.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this such a short time or were there any themes we
                        should try to develop while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, it's an interesting case study in what happens to an area
                    specialist in a place like this.</p>
                <p>The big issue when I got there was arms. People in the Department, the Assistant
                    Secretary Hal Saunders and my predecessor in Rabat, Bob Anderson, thought they
                    had settled it in a conversation with the king during the summer. The question
                    was arms for use in the Sahara.</p>
                <p>When I was talking about Algeria, I should have mentioned the move of the
                    Moroccans into the western Sahara in 1975. The Algerians opposed this and began
                    supporting the Polisario guerrilla against the Moroccans, and the Moroccans
                    found themselves bogged down in a guerrilla war which was getting nastier and
                    nastier and quite serious by 1978. They had gone in the Sahara, I am convinced,
                    with encouragement from Kissinger. I think the historical record will show that
                    some day.</p>
                <p>The Carter administration came in. Vance came in. We got a regional approach as
                    opposed to Kissinger's global approach. The regionalists in the Bureau of
                    African Affairs were very concerned because the African countries were concerned
                    about this Moroccan expansionism into the western Sahara. They opposed the use
                    of American arms—and we'd long had an arms supply arrangement with Morocco. They
                    opposed the use of these arms in the Sahara.</p>
                <p>The legal advisor of the Department, Herb Hansell, who has been a member of my
                    board in the Association for Diplomatic Studies, issued what I call a fatwa or
                    decree; F-A-T-W-A, it is what a mufti issues, M-U-F-T-I. It was a decree saying,
                    in effect, arms we supplied under our military assistance program for the
                    defense of Morocco could not be used in the Sahara because we did not recognize
                    Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara yet because there had been on act of
                    self-determination for the Saharan people.</p>
                <p>I had no idea this rain cloud was gathering when I went to Morocco. But it burst
                    almost as soon as I got there over an issue of helicopters ordered from Augusta
                    Bell, the Italian helicopter company that manufactures helicopters under license
                    from Bell U.S.A. And because they are under license from an American company,
                    our munitions control people still had a veto over their final export. The
                    Department, in its wisdom, had informed the Italians that these helicopters
                    could not be exported to Morocco unless the Moroccans gave us the commitment
                    they would not be used in the Sahara.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>This made the king very unhappy. At one point, he summoned me and the Italian
                    Ambassador to Marrakech. Pretending he was talking to the Italian Ambassador—the
                    two of us in the same room with him, sitting on the same couch—but actually
                    talking to me saying in effect, if the Americans didn't give him these
                    helicopters, they could forget about any kind of military cooperation with
                    Morocco.</p>
                <p>Although I had earlier opposed the Moroccan move into the Sahara, I thought it
                    had been a mistake and I thought we should have opposed it. I knew Secretary
                    Vance—because I had heard him say it—like Secretary Kissinger, thought that the
                    creation of another mini-state there would be a mistake. And I felt, as long as
                    I'm working for the Secretary, I've got to support his position. I am going to
                    be a good soldier about this. After this conversation with King Hassan I sent a
                    telegram saying, “You know, you people are expecting the Moroccans to do this
                    and that for you. You are expecting them to send troops to Zaire to support
                    Mobutu. You are expecting them to give security advice and training to people in
                    the Persian Gulf area. You want some limited facilities out of them. You expect
                    continued cooperation in terms of intelligence. If you want those things, the
                    price of them is these helicopters. And you are going to have to release
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Well, the Department changed its view and released the helicopters which I got
                    credit from the Moroccan military but not from the King thanks in part to the
                    country director in the Department who told the Moroccan Ambassador about it
                    before telling me. So the Moroccan Ambassador could report it as though it was
                    his accomplishment rather than mine. When I went to tell the Foreign Minister in
                    the morning that we received the telegram, he said, “Well, I have just heard
                    this from Ali Benjelloun, the ambassador.” Ali Benjelloun, A-L-I B-E-N-J-E-L-
                    L-O-U-N. He thought that Ali Benjelloun had pulled this off, he didn't realize
                    that I had.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, the Shah arrived. He told the king that he had been dropped
                    like an old slipper by the Americans. I think the king, perhaps provoked into
                    this by the Minister of Interior, Driss Basri, D-R-I-S-S B-A-S-R-I, one of the
                    more sinister people I have know in my career, and there were press reports and
                    so forth indicating that Carter was anti- monarchical, he concluded that I had
                    been sent—that I must have been involved in these earlier coup attempts—and that
                    I had been sent to get rid of him. One of his complaints about me was that I
                    knew too many people. He said ambassadors are not supposed to know that many
                    people. They should be more discreet.</p>
                <p>So that was the end of my Foreign Service career at that point. I left in June
                    and came back. I was the advisor to the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force
                    Base for a year while looking around for something else to do. I left in
                    1980.</p>

                        you have been given a rough deal, let's do something nice for you.” Or was
                        it sort of you have been touched with the equivalent of Foreign Service
                        leprosy, and there was the sort of general idea of, you know, I hope you
                        just fade away. Did you feel this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, my friends at NEA were supportive in the sense that they arranged
                    to give me a medal. I was given the Distinguished Service Award to show the
                    Moroccans that I was highly regarded. They took their time about sending a
                    replacement out for me who was Angie Duke. They decided not to send a career
                    officer there for the time being, and they haven't so far. That's ten years
                    now.</p>
                <p>The Director General was not very helpful. Largely because the Under Secretary,
                    Mr. Christopher, was not helpful. I am told that—I don't know how true this
                    is—but I am told by somebody who is in the position to know that Mr. Christopher
                    had vetoed me for several places that had been suggested.</p>
                <p>Actually, in all fairness to the Department, I was offered several jobs that
                    would have been interesting. I was offered the economic and social
                    ambassadorship at New York. I didn't take it because at that point, I really was
                    exhausted. I just didn't want to take the stress. I had had a medical problem of
                    vertigo brought on by stress which I have been fighting for seven years. I just
                    didn't want to put up with it. I wanted to go off to some place restful for a
                    while and think about it, which is why I agreed to go to Maxwell Air Force
                    Base.</p>
                <p>I was offered an NIO job, a National Intelligence Officer job, by Stansfield
                    Turner at the CIA which would have been fun, but I would have been cutoff at the
                    knees when Casey came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I'm quite sure that if I had wanted to hang in there, I would have gotten another
                    post eventually. I just had to go have a cooling off period, a decontamination
                    period some where. I couldn't ever consider going to an Arab monarchy, but I
                    didn't particularly want to anyway. And there wasn't any Arab post I was
                    interested in serving at anymore. I mean, I was tired of the Arab world. I
                    wanted to get out for a while and there were a lot of other things that I wanted
                    to do. I really wasn't very interested. I felt it was demeaning to go around
                    trying to wiggle my way into places as some of my colleagues have done. I just
                    wasn't interested in that. I was concerned for my self-respect as well as for my
                    health. We had been abroad for almost ten years, and I really didn't want to go
                    back. I wanted to be with my family. For a whole bunch of reasons, I decided
                    that I had had it. I had done everything that I had ever set out to do in my
                    career and more. I thought it was time to let somebody else take on.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Well, no, you know, it's sort of hard to point to real milestones of
                    accomplishment. On the strictly personal side, in some respects my greatest
                    accomplishment other than these two was that I was the first non-Arab to get an
                    S-4 R-4 rating in Arabic. I set out to try to establish myself as something of
                    an authority on the Arab world, and I succeeded in that to a degree that I am
                    able today to practice as a pundit of the third-class in Washington. I am able
                    to pontificate on Near Eastern matters in the media from time to time.</p>
                <p>It was a very satisfying career. I can't think of anything I would have rather
                    have done. I have no nostalgia to go back and do any of it again. It was great
                    while it lasted. My wife keeps saying that the most fun was when I was a
                    political officer. But when I got above the rank of political counselor, then I
                    had to start worrying about morale and entertaining people that I really wasn't
                    interested in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My best job was chief of the consular section in
                        Belgrade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the last question. A young man or a young woman
                        comes to you today and says, “What about the Foreign Service as a career?”
                        How would you advise them today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I get this question frequently. I say to them what I have just said to
                    you. I can't think of anything I would have enjoyed better. I never had a dull
                    moment. I was never bored. There was always something new. Always something
                    interesting. If someone is interested in travel and possibly adventure and is
                    interested in other people in other regions and is reasonably bright, I
                    recommend it. I recommend it highly. It's not for everybody. But certainly I
                    can't think of any other career that I know of that I would have found as
                    satisfying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dick, I want to thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: My pleasure.</p>
