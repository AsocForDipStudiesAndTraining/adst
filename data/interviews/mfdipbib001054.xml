                <p>AMBASSADOR WILLIAM C. SHERMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas Stern </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 27, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me start with the usual first question we raise in
                        every interview. Tell us a little bit about your background, where you were
                        raised, where you obtained your occupation and how you became interested in
                        international relations and the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I was born in Kentucky and raised in several towns in that state,
                    Pennsylvania and Ohio. My family settled down in Louisville where I went to high
                    school. I started college there at the University of Louisville. Then the war
                    came along, and I joined the Navy in 1943. After boot camp and a couple of
                    training schools, the Navy sent me back to the same college for a while. Until
                    that point, I was a dedicated and confirmed English major hoping to write the
                    great American novel. I had no particular interest at that time in foreign
                    affairs or international politics. But in the course of advancing through
                    midshipman school and officers' training, I wound up in the Navy School of
                    Oriental Languages in Colorado to study Japanese. I guess that was the beginning
                    of my career in the international field.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The war ended six months after I finished language training. But the Navy in
                    those days thought it was going to be involved in the occupation of Japan, and I
                    continued my studies until I graduated from the program in 1946. Instead of
                    going to Japan, I was assigned to Washington, DC to what was called the
                    Washington Document Center, a joint service intelligence operation staffed by
                    American, British and Canadian officers from all services. It was located in an
                    old garage owned by the Stuart Motor Company located near Fifth and K Streets,
                    across from the old Washington Market. The building was six stories high, filled
                    with British, Canadian and American language specialists busily engaged in
                    translating so-called “captured” documents from China and Japan. Every day,
                    someone would dump a mail sack full of books that had been ransacked from some
                    library in Japan behind each analyst's desk. These were not, in any sense of the
                    word, “captured” documents nor were they of any intelligence interest or value.
                    They included everything from pamphlets on horse breeding in Kyushu to outdated
                    texts on commerce and trade. There were teams in Japan which were going through
                    libraries appropriating whatever they could get a hold of and shipping them back
                    to the Document Center. This was done on the assumption that there just might be
                    some material of interest to intelligence. Our job was first of all, to scan all
                    the material coming in. The scanning teams would translate the titles, the name
                    of the author, where it had been published, and write a few sentences about the
                    contents. It was a mindless occupation; the assignment was very boring. An
                    accession list would be compiled and circulated to Washington agencies in the
                    hopes that perhaps some bureaucrat might find a subject of interest which then
                    would require a full translation of the material.</p>
                <p>I did the scanning for a while and then was transferred to one of the translation
                    teams. I remember translating the diary of a Japanese tourist who had taken a
                    trip through the South Manchuria area on the Trans-Siberian railroad. That might
                    sound intriguing, but it was not. His comments were mostly about the weather and
                    other subjects of very little intelligence value. It always amazes me how people
                    view Naval intelligence—an oxymoron perhaps—as a glamorous assignment; it
                    certainly was not that.</p>
                <p>I had volunteered to stay on duty after the end of the war simply because I
                    wanted somehow to use the language I had spent fourteen months studying. I had
                    hoped to be assigned to Japan, but MacArthur was sending home all the Navy's
                    Japanese speaking officers. I think he understood that language meant power and
                    he wanted to keep that in the exclusive hands of the Army. No Navy people were
                    being assigned to Japan. I thought I was condemned for another year at least to
                    the dull life of Navy intelligence in Washington. Mary Jane and I were married
                    in language school , and in 1946 our daughter was born.. Housing was so
                    difficult to find they couldn't join me in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>One day I received a letter from the Navy saying that my application to remain on
                    active duty had been approved. Miraculously, the very next day I got another
                    letter saying that my application had been disapproved. So I tore up the first
                    letter and immediately took the second to the separation center which processed
                    me out of the Navy expeditiously. No one ever found the first letter; that was
                    the way the Navy operated in those days. Once formally out of the Navy, I simply
                    went across the river to the Pentagon and presented myself to the Army and asked
                    whether a Japanese language capable person might be employed in Japan by them.
                    They said they would consider my request. Two months later, I received a letter
                    from the Army saying that it would be glad to send me to Korea as a “Junior
                    Principal Assistant”. The pay was a princely salary of $3,300 including the 25%
                    overseas differential.</p>
                <p>So I went to Korea. When we reached Korea, we found that the program to which we
                    had been assigned had never been started. The idea had been to send Japanese
                    language officers to Korea as staff aides to military government officials who
                    worked in the various Korean ministries. It was a U.S. Army run program. The
                    concept called for a rotation of these junior staff people going from Ministry
                    to Ministry, learning about military government. Thereafter, we would be ready
                    for some senior position in that military government. As I said, the program
                    never came to fruition. When we arrived in Korea—there were about fifteen of us—
                    we had no jobs and were left to our own devices to find a job. I found that Dick
                    Petree, who was a classmate from the language school, was in Chinhae working for
                    a U.S. Coast Guard detachment which was training the Korean Coast Guard. When we
                    occupied Korea, in accordance with an agreement with the Russians we did not
                    allow the formation of an Army or a Navy; we permitted only a Coast Guard and a
                    constabulary to maintain order and tranquility. We were still negotiating with
                    the Soviets in an effort to establish a unified Korea, which of course never
                    came to pass.</p>
                <p>So I ended up at the Korean Coast Guard Academy. I was the advisor to the
                    Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy. I was supposed to be an alter-ego to
                    him, but in fact I established an English course to teach the cadets our
                    language. Many of those students are by now retired senior military officers;
                    there were a couple who became company Presidents. I have seen some of them
                    during trips I have taken to Korea during the course of last forty-five years.
                    At the Academy, I used Japanese; in those days, most of the students spoke
                    better Japanese than Korean. They had been raised during the Japanese occupation
                    of Korea and learned Japanese in their educational system. It was the official
                    language and although many spoke Korean at home, that was not true for all of
                    them. Although Koreans had bitter feelings about Japan and its people, they had
                    no trouble using Japanese with me when I told them that I didn't speak Korean.
                    They had no problem in using our mutual language, so communication was not an
                    issue. The Korean Commandant spoke excellent English which he had learned in
                    missionary schools in Manchuria where he had been raised. I also helped the
                    Academy develop a curriculum. There was another American assigned to the
                    Academy—Bill Shaw —who had been at language school with me. He belonged to a
                    missionary family which had connections with Korea as long as those of the
                    Underwoods.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We lived in housing which had been part of an old Japanese Naval base in Chinhae.
                    The houses are still there. It is close to the Naval Academy. Of course, in
                    those days, the twenty miles of paved road between Inchon and Seoul were just
                    about all that existed in Korea It used to take five or six hours to travel by
                    jeep over the mountainous dirt road between Pusan and Chinhae.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, the U.S. Coast Guard was training Koreans so that they
                    could establish their own Coast Guard. The U.S. Army was training the
                    constabulary. The U.S. Coast Guard detachment consisted of approximately ten
                    officers, twenty Chief Petty Officers and four or five civilians (Bill Shaw,
                    Dick Petree and myself and a couple of others). We were actually U.S. Army
                    civilians, assigned to the Coast Guard detachment. There was a Coast Guard
                    Captain in Seoul who was the overall commander. There was a training group in
                    Chinhae, headed by an officer who had headed the seamanship department at the
                    U.S. Coast Guard Academy. In addition to the Academy, there was a shipyard in
                    Chinhae also run by the Coast Guard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Korea like in 1946?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It is hard to imagine for anyone who knows Korea today. We landed in
                    Inchon and were bussed into Seoul, where we arrived late in the afternoon. We
                    came in through the South Gate plaza. It was a big city even then by standards
                    of that time—about 1 million people. It had no electricity because the North
                    Koreans had cut off the supply—the North had all the power generation
                    capability. My first lasting impression was the smell of the acetylene gas
                    coming from the lamps that had been placed on the tables that filled the South
                    Gate area. These tables were made of 2x4's on trestles. The lamps' flames
                    illuminated only about a circle of two feet and also filled the air with the
                    odor of the gas. We would see these spots of light all around the plaza where
                    people were selling cigarettes and bars of soap, called Luck, which were
                    packaged similarly to Lux soap bars. Of course, Lux was in much greater demand,
                    but also much scarcer. People were clothed in old Japanese army uniforms. Nobody
                    wore anything that was not tattered, torn and patched. That was true of shirts
                    and ties, if anyone had them. This was true even of the upper middle class; they
                    too were shabbily dressed. Rice was rationed and scarce. Creature comforts were
                    not in existence. The few cars that did run were old , Japanese made Datsuns and
                    Mitsubishis (nothing like those of today) and were often out of commission. The
                    Koreans have a great knack for making things out of nothing. If something could
                    be held together with bailing wire, they would make it work. Taxis had open
                    hibachis in the back seat for heat. Streetcars and busses were always
                    over-crowded.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The military government was making valiant efforts to cope with the situation. It
                    kept the country going by importing food stuffs and other basics. It brought in
                    fertilizer and fuel. It brought in two huge power barges loaded with generators
                    which eventually became the basis of a power grid for South Korea. But for most
                    Koreans it was a very marginal existence. People lived in old-style Korean
                    houses which were essentially mud walls holding up a thatched roof. There were
                    some who had to live in caves in the hills around Chinhae. These were left over
                    fortifications that the Japanese had constructed as coastal artillery sites
                    during their occupation Families and groups of Koreans lived in these caves.
                    Trucks were sent out each morning to provide food and sometimes to pick up the
                    dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, how successful was the U.S. Military
                        Government in Korea during the period you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I don' think the Military Government was terribly successful. It was
                    thrown together on the spur of the moment. No plans had been made for Korea. It
                    didn't know what its goals were. I don't believe it had a coordinated, thought
                    out plan. It certainly did not have the same caliber of personnel, either
                    military or civilian, that were assigned to the military government in Japan.
                    There we had a central guiding thesis; MacArthur was directly and personally
                    involved in the management of the country's affairs. Korea, both from the policy
                    maker's point of view and that of the logistician, was the end of the line.
                    There were no language or area specialists. We did not have adequate supplies.
                    The American personnel, in the main, were either people that couldn't be used in
                    Japan or second raters. So the Korea Military Government was not a very
                    successful operation. Moreover, the Koreans had no desire to have a military
                    government. They considered themselves liberated and they were very anxious to
                    have us go home so that they could begin the self-government process.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Once an Embassy was established and once a Economic Cooperation Administration
                    Mission was started, we had much better feel for what we should be doing and
                    that certainly improved our inter-action with the Koreans, despite the fact that
                    the Korean government was fairly chaotic. Almost all of the Korean independence
                    leaders, were living in exile during the Japanese occupation of the Peninsula.
                    Syngman Rhee was probably the loudest voice among them; he was the most hyped of
                    the refugees. He had lobbied for the Korean cause in Geneva and in New York. He
                    had a substantial group of Americans, led by John Staggers, who supported him
                    and his cause financially and morally. He was Elaine Lady's father. Korea.
                    Elaine and her husband Harold (who died some years ago) came back to Korea wen
                    Rhee was elected the first President of the new Republic and served as advisers
                    on his personal staff. The Ladys and Robert T. Oliver, a publicist, and some
                    other Americans were part of the Rhee machine sometimes called the “kitchen
                    cabinet”. In addition to Rhee there were other exiles who returned to attempt to
                    play roles in the new Korea. Kim Ku, who threw the bomb in Shanghai that maimed
                    Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and. who had lived in China and Manchuria
                    was an active contender. Dr. Philip J. Sohn—Sohn Jai-pil—was persuaded to come
                    back from his medical practice in Hawaii to participate in Korean politics. US
                    military government officials were not persuaded that Rhee was the right person
                    to lead Korea and they wanted to have a few other potential candidates in order
                    to make the eventual elections more credible. Not all of the returnees were
                    pro-Rhee; some had their own political constituencies. Various members of the
                    Korean government, which had been established under our Military Government,
                    were attaching themselves to one political candidate or another. The Coast
                    Guard, for example, supported Kim Ku, although in the end Syngman Rhee won all
                    of the political power.</p>
                <p>The proliferation of candidates made for a lively political scene, although
                    somewhat dicey at times. People were really fighting with each other. Kim Ku,
                    for example, was assassinated in the Fall of 1948, right after the elections,
                    and that was quite a day. The alleged killer was identified, although there were
                    many stories that the suspect was taking the blame for one of Rhee's henchmen.
                    We did not get very much involved in this internal political struggle. There was
                    a section of the Military Government that was responsible for liaison with the
                    various political factions. Captain Leonard Bertsch was very much involved in
                    the political maneuvering. I was down in Chinhae for much of this period, pretty
                    much isolated from the activities in Seoul, but we would hear some of the
                    stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1948, you left the Coast Guard and went to work for ECA
                        in Seoul. How did assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Bill Shaw and I were the only two American civilians left at the Coast
                    Guard Academy in Chinhae. The Military Government was in its last days; the
                    American Coast Guard detachment was being transferred back to the States as was
                    the 6th Artillery Division, which provided us with logistic support. There was
                    no reason for any American presence any longer.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>At that point, Bob Kinney, who was then the special assistant to Dr. Arthur
                    Bunce, came to Chinhae. He had known the Shaw family from missionary days. He
                    picked up Bill and myself and said that he would find spots for both of us with
                    the ECA Mission in Seoul. So we moved to Seoul and became members of the
                    Performance Review section of the Mission which was then run by J. Franklin Ray,
                    who had been a professor at Harvard. An advance group of FSO'had come to Seoul
                    earlier in 1948, augmenting the staff of the U.S. Consulate General which had
                    been the State Department presence operating throughout the occupation. Mr.
                    Landon was the Consul General; David Mark was the Vice-Consul. It also had a few
                    American support staff personnel. They lived in the old Consulate General
                    residence and worked in a nearby building.</p>
                <p>Gradually, the civilian American presence began to beefed up. Donald Macdonald,
                    Gregory Henderson and Curt Pendergast all of whom had been given some Korean
                    language training in the Unites States joined the staff when an Embassy was
                    established on August 15, 1948. Each of them then headed up a section of the CG.
                    John Rozier (another FSO) did the administrative work, Pendergast did the
                    consular work and McDonald started an economic section. Then ECA arrived and
                    that greatly expanded State Department's presence. Some of the ECA people , like
                    me and Bill Shaw, were recruited from the Military Government. A Joint
                    Administrative Services Section was established, headed by Lewis Benjamin, a
                    real administrative wheeler-dealer. He unfortunately was killed later in an
                    automobile accident in Spain. Harold Noble, Greg Henderson and others started a
                    Political Section. We had no USIA this being the days before that organization
                    was founded. The ECA group was amalgamated with the Economic Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was ECA's main objective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: ECA's main objective was to put Korea back on its economic feet. The
                    plan was a phased operation. The immediate goal was to re-establish the power
                    grid by constructing hydro-electric power facilities, bringing in two power
                    barges, and attempting to construct or rehabilitate thermal powered plants.
                    Korean coal was mined to fuel these plants, but it was of such poor quality that
                    it didn't help very much. Once the power grid had been restored, the next step
                    was to reconstruct of the industrial base. We also imported large quantities of
                    fertilizer to boost farm production, particularly rice. That rice was supposed
                    to be of such high grade that it would serve as an export commodity to other
                    nations in East Asia—Japan and Southeast Asia. where it was said to be in great
                    demand — and provide foreign exchange to the infant republic. This was before
                    the days of the green revolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The earnings of the rice exports were intended to enable Korea to earn sufficient
                    foreign exchange to buy foreign manufacturing equipment and thereafter
                    theoretically become a self-sustaining economic entity in the modern world.
                    Unfortunately, ECA and Syngman Rhee did not see eye-to-eye on economic policy.
                    Rhee had spent many years in Hawaii here land was treasured square inch by
                    square inch. He therefore focused on reclaiming land around the Han River. He
                    had grandiose ideas of what could be done; he had grandiose idea of how much the
                    foreign market would pay for Korean rice. There was constant tension between ECA
                    Mission and the economists in the Rhee government. The central problem therefore
                    became how to talk a very stubborn old man into doing things he didn't want to
                    do.</p>
                <p>In addition, the Embassy was faced with the political problem of dealing with
                    North Korea. Rhee wanted to immediately enhance Korea's offensive and defensive
                    capabilities because of the threat from the North. He demanded our assistance to
                    provide him with those capabilities. There was a lot of enthusiasm among some
                    Korean military for a push North, but Rhee managed to keep those impulses in
                    check. No one has ever seriously accused Rhee of desiring an invasion of the
                    North. We had an 700 man American military advisory group under Brigadier
                    General Roberts. Those personnel were stationed alongside their Korean
                    counterparts, practically down to the company level. They kept an eye on the
                    Korean military. They were essentially there as trainers, but they also
                    monitored what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the coterie which surrounded Rhee at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I'll try, but you have to remember that I was a very junior officer at
                    the time—24 or 25 years old. I was certainly not an experienced political
                    analyst, but I watched the game with fascination. Rhee maintained his contacts
                    with those he knew before and during the war. He was still close to John
                    Staggers, who was represented in Seoul, as I mentioned earlier, by his daughter
                    Elaine and her husband Harold, who were cast as international lawyers. They
                    served as advisors to Rhee and served as important intermediaries between Rhee
                    and the Mission and the Embassy. The Ambassador could see Rhee any time he
                    wished, but the rest of the staff often used Elaine and Harold Lady as
                    transmission belts. They often served as the actual Korean action officers on a
                    number of issues. Harold particularly was often involved in working out certain
                    deals.</p>
                <p>Robert T. Oliver came out and founded a newspaper—The Korea Herald—in English
                    that was published in Seoul. That paper was published regularly and contained
                    adulatory editorials about Rhee and his activities. Oliver had written a book
                    “Syngman Rhee: Prophet and Saint”. So you can well imagine what he had to say
                    about Rhee in his editorial columns.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>There were a number of American educated Koreans who served in Rhee's
                    governments. Lincoln Kim headed up the Korean Office of Planning. The Foreign
                    Minister was Ben Limb—Yim P'yun-jik—. Lousie Yim was the Minister of Commerce
                    and Industry, which was a rather unusual job in Korea at that time. Ho Chung ,
                    then the Minister of Transportation later became a prominent figure in Korean
                    politics. All of these people were old friends and associates of Rhee's. The
                    Cabinet could hardly be described as balanced. There were no other factions
                    represented; the Ministers were all Rhee allies.</p>
                <p>I started at the ECA Mission as a special assistant to the Director, Professor
                    Ray. There wasn't enough work for all of the special assistants, so I moved to
                    the Statistics Section, which was part of the Program Review Office. we
                    published a monthly publication on Korean economic statistics—foreign trade,
                    production, etc. Each member of the staff compiled data for one economic sector
                    or another. That statistical base was absolutely essential to the development of
                    an economic program. The Koreans were not keeping any statistics at all or at
                    least were not making them available to anyone. So our monthly publication as
                    the basis for all economic projections.</p>
                <p>I worked on oil imports and distribution. I got the raw material from the
                    American and British oil companies—KOSCO (The Korean Oil Storage Company). That
                    was the consortium that handled all oil imports, basically formed by CALTEX,
                    STANVAC and SHELL with some minor Korean participation. In addition, there were
                    a number of Americans that worked in Korean power plants; they had been in the
                    Military Government as members of its Department of Commerce. They had stayed
                    on. They provided us data on power production. We had advisors at the Korean
                    Exchange Bank and the Bank of Korea, who would supply data. Our Mission had a
                    Commerce and Heavy industry Section, who had liaison responsibilities with
                    Korean firms and the government and they provided some information. Obviously,
                    it was not very systematic way to capture statistics, but it was the best that
                    could be done under the circumstances. We did not at the time have advisors
                    attached to any Ministries, but we had sections in the Mission responsible for
                    following the activities of each economic Ministry.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Bill Shaw was working on foreign trade. He and an another guy kept track of the
                    port records kept by the Ministry of Commerce and Trade. I had my doubts about
                    the statistics that we generated, but they were better than the Korean records.
                    After doing this compilation task for six months, I developed on my own a
                    handbook on the organization of the Korean Government. I tried to standardize
                    the names of the Ministries and the various independent organizations, like the
                    Board of Audit and the Office of Planning. I found the original decrees that set
                    up these various institutions and translated them into English. The product of
                    all this effort provided the best picture of how the Korean Government was
                    supposed to look. The names of the governmental leaders were written in Korean,
                    Chinese letters and English. I summarized the responsibilities of each Office in
                    each Bureau of each Ministry. It took almost a year to complete this effort.
                    When it was finished, it was the only manual in existence on the Korean
                    government, and used widely both in Seoul and in Washington. It was a labor of
                    love. I never believed that every section of the government did what the law
                    said they were supposed to do, but at least it was an attempt to put the
                    organization down on paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that we did not provide “advisors” in such areas
                        as public administration, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: We did not. The only American “advisors” were attached to the KMAG who
                    provided advice to the police. they trained Korean military policemen and worked
                    as liaison with Korean officials responsible for internal security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about your living conditions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: The Mission's policy was not to take over Korean housing. So we occupied
                    abandoned Japanese housing. We purchased what is now known as Embassy Compound
                    2, which consisted of old Japanese houses. We rehabilitated them and used them.
                    Some, like the so-called Finance House were rather large. That was run by Al
                    Loren, who headed the Finance Section of the ECA Mission. It was sort of a
                    bachelor officers' quarters. People were invited to live in the Finance House.
                    It had many rooms because it had been an old mansion. The house also contained a
                    fancy mess hall. The other houses were assigned to families in the usual
                    basis—size of family, rank, etc. In addition, there were several hundred
                    Japanese railway houses westward out Ulchi Ro near the so-called Old Queen's
                    Palace. That area of town was known as The Gold Coast. These houses, even by
                    modern Japanese standards, were good sized and in fair condition, since they had
                    been occupied by Japanese railroad workers. Mary Jane and I lived there.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>When we first arrived in Seoul, there was no electricity. That lasted for the
                    first few months we were there. We ate and read by Coleman lanterns or candles.
                    We cooked on wood-coal ranges. In their zeal to modernize the housing, the
                    Americans put in modern plumbing in lieu of the old fashioned baths which had
                    fires under them to heat the water. We had running water coming out of taps;
                    unfortunately, it was all cold. So to take a bath, we had to heat the water on
                    the stove for about a day. The large bathtubs were made of terrazzo, which meant
                    that when the hot water was poured into the tubs, only about two inches would be
                    in the tub and that would turn cold very rapidly because the walls of the tub
                    would absorb the heat of the water very rapidly. It was very primitive.</p>
                <p>I used to watch carefully for visitors who came to Seoul to see whether it
                    included any friends who might be staying at the Chosun Hotel. We would invite
                    the friend to dinner and when he accepted, I would volunteer to pick him up and
                    sneak in a shower in his hotel room first. Finding a location which had hot
                    water became a major achievement. The Chosun was functioning and had become the
                    center of social life in Seoul. The other major hotel, and perhaps the only
                    other hotel in town, was the Bando (known as the “Peninsula” during the
                    occupation). When we opened the Embassy, the Bando was deeded to the U.S.
                    government in perpetuity by the Korean government in gratitude for the
                    assistance we had provided in freeing Korea from Japanese occupation. The
                    Embassy occupied the first five floors; the remaining three floors were made
                    into small efficiency apartments for staff and single officers. On the top
                    floor, the Bando had a dining room.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our objectives in Korea when you were serving
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: We had hoped to achieve unification. There was a U.N. mission in Seoul,
                    which had been opened even before our Embassy began operation. It was trying to
                    negotiate with the Soviets and the North Koreans, but neither of those parties
                    were interested in any negotiations. A Joint Committee consisting of US and
                    Soviet representatives met more or less regularly in Seoul at the Duk Soo Palace
                    during 1945 -47 but spent its time arguing over detail, exchanging
                    recriminations and achieving nothing — the usual stalling tactics that the
                    Russians used in those days. The U.N. and we made various attempts to open
                    serious negotiations to arrange country wide elections, but there was no
                    response at all from the other side. The 38th parallel became a firm and fixed
                    dividing line. It was a ridiculous arbitrary line which even left parts of South
                    Korea accessible only by sea because the land entrances were in North Korea. The
                    border was heavily fortified with heavy military concentrations on both sides,
                    particularly along the mountain passages which permitted access on a north-south
                    route.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Beyond the unification goal, we were very interested in stabilizing the country
                    economically. Once the Rhee government was elected, we then were anxious for a
                    democratic constitution to be written and approved. We had a lot to do with the
                    drafting of that constitution. An American—a German refugee—Dr. Ernst Frankel
                    was a constitutional legal scholar and a wonderful man. He had been employed by
                    the military government, but stayed on after Korean independence as part of the
                    legal section of the ECA Mission. He worked almost exclusively on drafting that
                    constitution working closely with the Korean provisional government.</p>
                <p>I think we must have had about 200-300 in the Embassy itself, including a large
                    administrative support staff. That number included also probably 30-40 political
                    and economic officers. The ECA Mission had another 150-200 people. The Military
                    Advisory Group must have had 600-700 officers and staff. So there was a large
                    American presence in Seoul by the end of the 1940s.</p>
                <p>Seoul had a “frontier” atmosphere about it by 1949. People dressed well, but
                    there were no passenger cars on the streets for example. There were jeeps which
                    were the common mode of transportation. There may have been one or two private
                    sedans, but they couldn't be driven outside of Seoul because there were no paved
                    roads in the countryside, no repair facility and probably no gas stations
                    either. The trains were not entirely reliable. When I first arrived in Korea,
                    those trains had to stop frequently to clean out coal clinkers from the engine
                    boilers; the coal was that bad. The windows were all broken out of the coaches.
                    There was supposed to be a daily Seoul-Pusan run; it wasn't necessarily so and
                    if the train did run, it may have taken 24 hours. For me, it was then another
                    six hour Jeep trip from Pusan to Chinhae. It was “frontier days” in Korean in
                    the late '40s.</p>
                <p>We operated our own commissary so that we could get adequate food supplies
                    without having to rely on the Korean market which could barely supply enough
                    food for its own people. There was nothing available on the market—no goods, no
                    souvenirs, no artifacts, no available art. We supported that country for many
                    years, not only in economic terms, but also culturally by assisting in the
                    rehabilitation of museums. We helped to get Seoul working again. Progress was
                    very slow. I would not consider that economic development of Korea was
                    successful while I was stationed there. There was visible improvement, but there
                    was a long way to go.</p>
                <p>The Koreans worked very hard and were very creative. Their ability to make
                    something out of nothing was a daily revelation. They put things together with
                    bailing wire, string and faith. It was remarkable. Strangely enough, all of this
                    misery was not depressing. The Americans were enthused about the challenges. We
                    worked and played together very well; there were a lot of community activities.
                    We staged some theater productions—Mary Jane and I were intimately engaged in
                    those. We put on the old standards like “George Washington Slept Here” and “You
                    Can't Take It With You”. We used Citizens' Hall for the performances. The
                    President and Mrs. Rhee came to opening night.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I spoke both English and Japanese to my Korean contacts. They did not resent the
                    use of Japanese once it was established that I couldn't speak Korean. It was the
                    easiest way to communicate. I could speak a few words of Korean, enough to
                    introduce myself and indicate that I couldn't really speak the language. I used
                    to ask whether it would be alright to speak Japanese; no one ever refused to
                    speak Japanese with me, even though all Koreans were unrelentingly hostile to
                    Japan and its people. They were also upset by their perception that the Japanese
                    were getting more assistance from us than they were. Rhee was particularly
                    bitter because he felt that we were coddling the Japanese and not giving enough
                    assistance to his country.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 1949, after we had moved to Seoul, Mary Jane and I, accompanied by
                    our good friends, the Sloanes, went back to Chinhae for a week's vacation. We
                    had arranged to stay with some American friends who were still there as civilian
                    advisors to what had become the Korean Navy. We arrived and moved in with our
                    friends. On the first night of our visit, we were visited by a delegation of
                    Korean officers. We overheard our host trying to explain to the Koreans that he
                    had guests in the house and couldn't possibly move. The Koreans had come to ask
                    that our host make room for a few days to accommodate President and Mrs. Rhee
                    who were arriving at Chinhae the next day for an important and secret meeting
                    with Chiang Kai-shek. (That meeting was supposed to conclude a Korea/Taiwan
                    anti-communist pact). The Koreans explained that they did not have an adequate
                    house for their President and therefore had to ask for our host to put up the
                    Rhees. When we learned what was going on, we volunteered to move next door to
                    the Navy BOQ so that there would be room for the President and his wife. So
                    indeed that is what happened. Chinhae was completely sealed off. No one could
                    enter or leave the town both for security and secrecy reasons.</p>
                <p>The meeting almost coincided with the issuance of the US White Paper on China,
                    which to say the least, did not give very strong support to Chiang Kai-shek.
                    That event delayed the Chinese delegation's arrival and the Rhees were therefore
                    in Chinhae with nothing much to do. I called the Embassy and was told by Everett
                    Drumright, the DCM, that I shouldn't be in Chinhae at all, but as long as I was
                    there, he wanted me to keep my ears and eyes open (the Embassy had not been
                    aware in advance that a meeting was to take place). Those were the instructions
                    that I followed. Madame Rhee noted at one stage that there were no photographers
                    around to record the event. I became the official photographer for the meeting
                    and I still have some shots of that historic event. I took the pictures of the
                    Chinese delegation as it arrived on a C-47 and deplaned. They landed on a small
                    landing strip that probably never had anything as large as a C-47 land on
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Madame Rhee was very gracious. She recognized that we had been displaced and so,
                    every evening, she would invite us over for drinks at the house they were using.
                    I got a chance to explain to President Rhee the work I was doing on the
                    organization manual of the Korean government. I think he was impressed that
                    something was being done and urged me to finish it. I had an opportunity to
                    listen to Rhee reminisce about his past. He became a very human figure during
                    those moments, and I realized just what an important leader in exile he had been
                    and how passionately he was committed to the rebuilding of his country. The
                    House that the Rhee used in Chinhae also became the site for the bilateral
                    meetings with Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                <p>The Chinese delegation included Chiang Kai-shek, K.C. Woo, who had been the Mayor
                    of Shanghai, the Chinese Ambassador and some Taiwan government Cabinet members.
                    It was quite a group, and very heady stuff for a twenty-five year old junior
                    member of an American mission to be on the fringes of</p>
                <p>I sent Mrs. Rhee copies of all the pictures. She graciously then invited us to
                    the Presidential Palace. The Rhees came to see a performance of “George
                    Washington Slept Here” and invited the cast for tea. I saw the President and
                    Mrs. Rhee on several occasions after the Chinhae episode. That chance meeting at
                    the Academy became very useful from my point of view. I called on Madame Rhee
                    much later in 1985, when I was Deputy Assistant Secretary in Far East Bureau.
                    Dixie Walker was then our ambassador in Korea. At that time, Mrs. Rhee was close
                    to 95 years old. I don't know whether she remembered the events of approximately
                    35 years earlier, but if she didn't, she pretended that she did. On that same
                    trip to Korea, I returned to Chinhae to see my old stamping grounds. I drove
                    down the Peninsula, through Taejon and Kyongju to Pusan and Chinhae. The same
                    two houses—the house that the Rhees stayed in and the BOQ—that were important
                    part of my story about the Rhee-Kai-shek meeting were still standing. Rhee had
                    never been to Chinhae before and was charmed by the place. The navy compound is
                    on a sugar-loaf peninsula that juts out into the harbor. The American government
                    had a house in Chinhae which was occupied in the late '40s by Major Granrud. He
                    had lived there when the military government was running Korea and had stayed on
                    after independence. Rhee saw the house and said that he would like to have it a
                    summer house. So it was cleared out and spruced up and the Rhees used it for
                    their vacations. It became the Korean equivalent of Camp David and remained that
                    way at least through the Park Chung Hee's regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>When I visited Chinhae in 1985, I went to that house, which was being treated as
                    a holy shrine. The guide told me that that was where Syngman Rhee and Chiang
                    Kai-shek had held their famous meeting in 1950. He said that the Speaker of the
                    Korean Assembly, Shin Ik Hee and General Hodge were in on the meeting which was
                    held to discuss the future of the Pacific. There were several other new myths
                    included by the young Korean CPO who led the tour. He, of course, had not even
                    been born when the events he was attempting to describe happened. I knew the
                    truth: the meeting had not been held in that house, General Hodge had long left
                    Korea, Shin Ik Hee was not at the meeting, etc. It was the first time I had ever
                    been in a position to contradict what had become history. I didn't do it there
                    because I didn't want to embarrass the guide.. But when I got back to Seoul I
                    made my views known about the revision of history to which I had been a personal
                    witness. I told Madame Rhee what I heard and she was mystified since there
                    wasn't any rational explanation. She knew the truth, but obviously no one had
                    ever asked her about what had happened in Chinhae in 1949.</p>
                <p>That 1949 episode is one of the reasons I decided to take the Foreign Service
                    exam. In those days, you had to take the orals in Washington. The written
                    portion I took in Seoul along with three others. The written then was a two and
                    half day exam which included questions that required long essay answers. It was
                    quite different from today's exam. I passed both the written and the oral, but
                    in those days there was an interminable period between passing the exam and
                    being offered a job. I was going to spend that time at the Yale Graduate School
                    where I had been accepted. We left Korea in April, 1950 staying a couple of days
                    in Japan and a couple of days in Hawaii on the way home.</p>
                <p>Of course, in June, 1950, the Korean War broke out. At that point, there were
                    very few people in the U.S. who knew anything about Korea. Almost all Korean
                    experts were in Korea. So there was a dearth of knowledgeable people in the
                    Department. The State Department Korean desk had only one or two people on it.
                    The Department had Chris Norred and Dick Sneider in INR. Norred had also been
                    one of the junior principal assistants who had gone to Korea at the same time as
                    I . By June, I passed all the tests and the physical exam and was therefore on
                    the list for appointment as a Foreign Service officer. But the actual
                    appointment would not have taken place for many months. I had already decided
                    not to return to academia. I felt that somehow I could be useful in Washington
                    in light of my experience. I went to the State Department and offered my
                    services. Basil Capella was then the Executive Director for the Bureau of Far
                    East Affairs. He said that the Department had an “employment freeze” and he just
                    couldn't give me any hope of employment. He didn't suggest any other part of the
                    Department which might be more optimistic. He was very negative.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So I went across the river to the Pentagon and to Naval Intelligence and offered
                    my services. They immediately processed me back into the Navy. As usual in the
                    Navy, once I had reported and was back in uniform, ready to work on Korea, I was
                    assigned to the Pakistan/Afghanistan/India/Ceylon desk of the Naval Intelligence
                    Service. So I sat there, doing relatively little; finally the word began to
                    circulate that there was Lieutenant (JG) Sherman who had just returned from
                    Korea. Once that was known, my phone began to ring and ring and ring. People
                    were calling for basic information on Korea's geography, people, history,
                    current events, etc. Eventually, after four or five months of advising
                    unofficially, I was moved to the Korea desk of Naval Intelligence. Soon after
                    that move, I received a letter from State Department, offering me an appointment
                    in the Foreign Service—that was about a year after having passed all the
                    entrance exams.</p>
                <p>When I had rejoined the Navy, I told them that I was awaiting a call from the
                    Foreign Service. I was told that that would be no problem; that when an offer of
                    employment was made, the Navy would release me or transfer me or somehow get me
                    over to the State Department. Of course, a month after I rejoined the Navy, it
                    issued an order stating that all reserve officers then on active duty were to
                    remain in the Service and would not be released until the end of the emergency.
                    So when I requested my release, I was told that it was very unlikely that it
                    would be approved.</p>
                <p>Alben Barkley was then the Vice President of the United States. He was a fellow
                    Kentuckian; he had known my grandfather well; his principal assistant was from
                    the same town I was brought up in. I wrote a letter to Mr. Barkley explaining my
                    circumstances and asking for his intervention so that I could begin my chosen
                    career. I thought that I could contribute more if I were in the Foreign Service
                    than in Naval Intelligence. I didn't really hope that my request would be acted
                    upon, but much to my surprise, the very next day, a special messenger arrived
                    and left an envelope in my mail box at Tyler Gardens—now called Winter Hill—in
                    Falls Church, where we were living at the time. It was a brief note from the
                    Vice President saying that although he had no jurisdiction in military matters,
                    he thought that I had a good case and that he would try to be of assistance.
                    Within three weeks, I was released to inactive duty and was able to join the
                    Foreign Service. That was March, 1951. Of course, the Department was also
                    surprised and was not prepared for my arrival. The next entrance class was
                    already filled; so I spent six months in INR working on Korea, employed in the
                    Foreign Service Staff Corps. I worked for the Korean section of the Office of
                    Intelligence Research. Dick Sneider was my boss.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When the next basic training class began in early summer, I was included. That
                    lasted three months. I had approximately 13-14 classmates. The course was longer
                    than it is today. We spent sometime just familiarizing ourselves with how
                    Washington was supposed to work and how the Department was organized. Various
                    Bureau representatives came to lecture and then we had people to talk to us
                    about overseas posts and the various opportunities that we would have. We spent
                    a week at the Labor Department, a week at Agriculture, a week at Commerce
                    learning about their functions and people. We spent a week in New York and
                    watched seamen's disciplinary hearings, went to Ellis Island, which was still
                    being used as the port of entry for immigrants. We watched the Custom and IN
                    Services in operation. Luke Battle, then the Special Assistant to Secretary Dean
                    Acheson, described to us a day in the life of a Secretary of State. We were
                    briefed on the major foreign policy issues of the time.</p>
                <p>I was one of the older people in the class—I was 29 by then. Most of my
                    colleagues were 25-26 years old. Many had been international relations or
                    political science majors in college or had gone to one of the Washington cram
                    schools. Many had had some graduate level education; some had a Master's Degree.
                    Almost all had had a long term interest in foreign affairs. A couple had been
                    interns in the State Department before taking the exams. They came from various
                    parts of the country; it was not all Ivy League by any means, although I would
                    guess that a preponderance did come from East Coast schools. All of the class
                    was white males.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the training period, we were all asked what onward assignments
                    might interest us. G. Lewis Jones had represented the Near East Bureau; he was
                    one of the most eloquent men that I have ever met. He wove a tale of mystery
                    about his area so that about half of the class volunteered to work in the Near
                    East. I didn't. Gerry Warner, who spoke for the Far East Bureau, made his area
                    sound very dull, but that didn't discourage me. I wanted to go to Japan and that
                    is were I ended up.</p>
                <p>But I didn't want to go overseas immediately. Mary Jane and I had been separated
                    for fourteen months when I first went to Korea and that had not been a pleasant
                    experience for either one of us. If I were to go overseas, I wanted the whole
                    family to go together. I had been assigned to the Consulate General in Yokohama,
                    but since SCAP was still running Japan, the State Department had to follow its
                    rules which barred families from accompanying an officer until a specific house
                    had been assigned to him or her. State representatives, until April 28, 1952,
                    were just the diplomatic arm of SCAP. They were not part of a State Department
                    operations. That was true of the Consulates General as well as the Tokyo
                    operations. All were part of SCAP, although on most matters, we operated
                    independently. But when it came to basic rules, we were all under the control of
                    the Supreme Commander Allied Powers.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>By chance, I found out that the Army was still running an exchange program with
                    Japan. It was about to bring to the United States five senior members of the
                    Japanese Diet. This delegation was to attend the Peace Treaty signing and then
                    spend three months touring the United States, studying it in depth. The Army
                    needed a bilingual escort officer, who could also serve as interpreter. I
                    volunteered and was in fact assigned to that task. We went to Washington, New
                    York, Boston, Chicago meeting with academics, business people, and politicians.
                    It was a great period during which I learned a lot. Eventually, I had to leave
                    them in Chicago while they went on to the West Coast. The Consulate General in
                    Yokohama, to which I had been assigned, was getting a little impatient. So, In
                    March, 1952, I arrived in Yokohama and Mary Jane and our two kids joined me at
                    the end of the following month—the day after SCAP no longer controlled State
                    operations in Japan.Our first home was in the old Consulate General building in
                    what had been the Consul General's apartment. It was quite luxurious for a Vice
                    Consul. It took us a long time before we had accommodations as good as those
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the Consulate General in 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I would guess that there were about ten officers and five or six clerks.
                    It was a sizeable post, particularly for that time. Our consular district
                    included three very active prefectures. I was assigned as the politico-military
                    officer, reporting directly to Washington. In those days, the constituent posts
                    sent their airgrams and despatches and the rare telegram directly to Washington,
                    with copies of the reports sent to the Embassy.When I first went to Yokohama, I
                    was an economic officer in the Consulate General and one of my jobs was if you
                    can believe it, to expand Japanese exports to the U.S.We had a Consul General,
                    whose job was primarily representation. The deputy, who was supposed to be
                    running the operation, was an old consul (non-career), Charlie Stephan, who
                    didn't do much of anything. He was an old fogey who had all but retired. We had
                    a citizenship officer, a shipping, protection and welfare officer, a visa
                    officer and two administrative people—an administrative officer and a general
                    services officer.</p>
                <p>Soon after I arrived, the Department went through some major down-sizing after
                    the advent of the Eisenhower administration. That reduction left Yokohama with
                    no clerks; all we had were Foreign Service officers. We did have a number of
                    resident Americans-Japanese with American citizenship. They were not hired as
                    local employees because they were American citizens, even though they lived in
                    Japan. They fitted into a general world wide category of personnel called
                    “Resident Americans” which had been established for Americans living overseas.
                    They obtained a regular security clearance so that they could handle classified
                    material, although we used them essentially as local employees. They were not
                    subject to transfer to other countries in the world. In the Japanese case, the
                    resident Americans were people who had gone to Japan before the war and had
                    stayed because of family ties.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Since they were all totally bilingual, we used them mostly in consular work. In
                    the 1952 reduction-in-force, they were all fired. Our “Shipping and Seamen”
                    officer position was deleted. By the time the decimation ended, we had a Consul
                    General, his deputy, four or five Vice-Consuls, and an administrative officer.
                    My duties as reporting officer were quickly ended and I was put in the consular
                    section, doing visa, shipping and welfare work. The shipping work was
                    interesting in some aspects. Sometime later, a Foreign Service Staff position
                    was re-established which enabled the Consulate General to return to doing some
                    political and economic reporting. But I stayed with the Consular section.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Shipping would not normally have been a problem in Yokohama, although there was
                    considerable American traffic in the port, much of it due to the Korean War
                    which was still being waged in 1952. Under an agreement with the Seamen's Union
                    of the Pacific (SUP), headed by Harry Lundenberg, a crew would receive a bonus
                    as soon as the ship crossed the date line because it was then deemed to have
                    entered a war zone. As soon as it left a Japanese port, the ship was deemed to
                    be in a combat zone and the crew received another 100% bonus. So it was quite
                    possible for an ordinary seaman, on a ship that shuttled back and forth between
                    Japan and Korea, to make triple his ordinary salary which added up to a
                    considerable amount. We had about twelve cargo ships called “Knot” ships because
                    they were all named after different knots—the “reef”, etc. They shuttled
                    regularly between Yokohama and Inchon or Pusan carrying supplies for our troops.
                    Of course, none of these ships were in any danger because neither the North
                    Koreans or the Chinese had any intention of engaging the U.S. Merchant Marine at
                    sea. In view of the bonuses paid, getting jobs on these ships was very
                    competitive. Theoretically, if a seaman had to be left behind by his ship
                    because of illness or other reason, it used to be the responsibility of the
                    American Consul shipping and seamen officer to find him another berth. The
                    American union set up a hiring hall in Yokohama and declared that it would
                    become responsible for the placement of American seamen. My predecessor in the
                    Shipping officer position had said that he would not accept that process and
                    vowed to fight it tooth and nail. The union began to publish a little four page
                    weekly newspaper—”The Harbor Light”—which was a scurrilous and
                    quasi-pornographic rag. It kept referring to the “Communist” Consul General who
                    was providing jobs to the Harry Bridges' union people. Harry Bridges' union was
                    a competitor of the SUP. There were vicious attacks in that monthly paper on the
                    Consul General and his staff. The “Shipping and Seamen” Section of the
                    Department was never as active on any issue as it was on the hiring function in
                    Yokohama. It was obvious to me that the Department was trying to find cover
                    because in the early '50s, seamen's unions were politically very powerful. By
                    the time I took the job, my instructions we to make peace with the SUP, which I
                    did. We basically let the SUP operate its own hiring hall, even though that
                    practice was legally suspect. We didn't try to block their activities. The
                    shipping laws, which were written for the protection of seamen, govern the
                    employment of any seaman who was seeking employment in an American port or any
                    American seaman seeking employment in any foreign port. These laws placed the
                    responsibility for assuring that the seamen were properly assigned and hired in
                    the hands of a Foreign Service Consul. A ship captain could not hire a seaman
                    unless a Consul was present. The Consul had to put his stamp on the employment
                    contract; all the papers relating to the ship's register and the employment had
                    to be deposited with the Consulate. These laws were passed to prevent the
                    shanghaiing of seamen or forcing them into assignments that were not suitable. A
                    very elaborate structure was established to protect the seamen. Any change in
                    the ship's crew, as stated in special articles, had to be done in the presence
                    of an American Consul. That is the way the law was written and I think might
                    still be. I don't think there have been many changes, although in light of the
                    demise of the American merchant marine, the consuls' workload has been greatly
                    reduced. Foreign seamen also needed transit visas as their ships sailed to the
                    United States, which required lot of documentation.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We were also busy with visas. These days was before the McCarran Act was passed
                    in 1953. The Japanese were viewed as “aliens ineligible for citizenship” and
                    therefore not permitted to immigrate to the United States. They could only go to
                    the U.S. as visitors for short periods of time or as students or members of
                    other special legal categories. Because they were ineligible for immigration, we
                    had to be particularly careful about the issuance of temporary visas to make
                    sure that they were bona fide visitors , students or some other on-immigrant
                    category who would return to Japan upon the expiration of their visas. That
                    meant that every applicant was screened thoroughly and investigated by the
                    Consular Section. There were a number of Japanese who even in the early '50s had
                    enough resources to visit the U.S. In addition, we had a lot of requests for
                    transit visas because many Japanese were immigrating to Canada and Latin
                    America. These countries were interested in recruiting particularly farm
                    laborers from Japan. This was the period, for example, when many Japanese
                    immigrated to Argentina. These people had to transit the United States on their
                    way to Latin America. Visas in those days required considerable processing. If
                    one ever watched the Menotti opera, The Consul, you can get an idea of how
                    complex the system was in those days. People would come to the Consular Section
                    and be asked to come back again because they didn't have the right size
                    photograph or were missing some document or didn't have a police certificate or
                    they didn't have a health certificate. It was painful. Some didn't get visas
                    because their children might have had TB which made the parents or siblings
                    ineligible. The processing of a visa application could take months—many, many
                    months in some cases. There were people who applied over and over again without
                    any hope of approval. It was a different occupation from that of a visa officer
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic situation in Yokohama in the early
                        '50s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It was recovering from the war's devastation, but still bad. Yokohama
                    was particularly hard hit because the city's principal activity were the export
                    of tea and silk. Silk became an increasingly minor factor after the invention of
                    nylon. The tea business was also in a depressed state. The Yokohama port had
                    been almost entirely taken over by the U.S. military; there were very few
                    private facilities left in the port area. The city had been decimated by our air
                    raids during the war. The Occupation Forces had established a large logistic
                    depot in Yokohama after bulldozing large tracts of land. Property lines became
                    non-existent. In most cases, that was not an important factor because much of
                    the property had been requisitioned by the military; very little had been
                    returned at that stage to its owners. Other Japanese cities, where the U.S. Army
                    was not such an overwhelming presence, managed to rebuild at a much faster pace
                    than Yokohama. Yokohama was a special case. To this day, the impact of our war
                    bombing and our post-war presence has turned Yokohama from the flourishing
                    export-oriented city it was before the war to essentially a bed-room community
                    of Tokyo. Its industrial and commercial base has never really returned.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The port has revived, but ships now stop in Tokyo as often as they do in
                    Yokohama. The port of Shimizu, which is just a little south of Yokohama, has
                    expanded greatly, as has Kobe. Yokohama has lagged far behind other ports in its
                    recovery; the government has been and still is active in trying to further
                    develop it, but in fact Yokohama never really recovered from the war and its
                    aftermath. It seems more like an old time museum—not a live town.</p>
                <p>Politically, Japanese cities have never been very powerful. There are only rare
                    instances of regional political powers. National politics are the major
                    interest. The various prefectures have governors' races; the cities and towns
                    have mayoralty races. But local officials do not have a great deal of authority
                    and have to depend on the central government for financial support and
                    direction. They can be very obstructive. For example, during the early '70s, the
                    Mayor of Yokohama, a socialist, decided that heavy vehicles could not cross the
                    city's bridges because it was not safe in view of the bridges' condition. That
                    happened right during the Vietnam war when we were sending our heavy trucks and
                    jeeps back to Japan for rehabilitation. Once repaired, those vehicles were
                    transported to Yokohama for shipment back to Vietnam. So a complete deadlock
                    developed. The Mayor wouldn't let the repaired vehicles down to the port area
                    and we had no other port immediately available. The Foreign Office finally
                    worked out a complicated by-pass arrangement which involved driving a very
                    circuitous route over roads that were barely passable, but at least did not
                    cross the Yokohama bridges and finally led to the port area. Local officials had
                    therefore a negative power, but in general were greatly dependent on the Tokyo
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me how you felt living, as an American, in a city
                        that we had damaged so heavily and whose citizens had suffered greatly at
                        our hands. What was your relationship to the local citizens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: The relationships were very good. The Japanese response to the
                    occupation was completely cooperative. They behaved entirely in a friendly
                    fashion. We never met a hostile population in Japan. In Yokohama as well as in
                    the rest of Japan, we had an active information program and an active
                    American-Japanese Society. There is hardly a Japanese locality that doesn't have
                    a sister-city relationship with some American city or town. We never noticed any
                    resentment about the damage that we wrought. The city government would
                    periodically seek return of certain properties or facilities and by the mid
                    '60s, almost all of the free standing facilities had been returned to the city
                    or the original owners. Our presence became increasingly consolidated in base
                    areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There were problems of course during this first tour in Japan from 1952 to 1956.
                    They were called “base problems” which involved such matters as camp-followers,
                    some theft and other low level criminal activity that tends to congregate
                    outside a base's perimeter. The citizens were not happy with this. A number of
                    Japanese movies were made, dramatizing and sensationalizing these conditions.
                    The Socialists, the Communists and some of the labor unions used these
                    conditions for their own political purposes. But by and large, the population
                    was not terribly unhappy. We still have problems. We have noise problems created
                    by night landing practices on carriers, we have problems caused by too many
                    people in spaces too small, we have problems created by our large presence in
                    places like Okinawa. But in general, the Japanese towns that are supported
                    economically by our military presence. like Yokosuka, are cooperative and there
                    is certainly no real tension between Japanese and Americans. It was true in the
                    early '50s; it is true today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Yokohama in June, 1954 and were assigned to
                        Tokyo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: That is correct. There is again a story behind that assignment. Mary
                    Jane I had gone to Tokyo in July, 1953, at the invitation of Bob Blake, then a
                    member of the Embassy's Political Section, to have dinner with him on July 3.
                    Then, the next day, we were his guests at the customary Fourth of July reception
                    at the Embassy. We also served as unofficial translators between American and
                    Japanese guests. There were a lot of Japanese political leaders there and needed
                    all the translators they could find. At one point, I found myself translating
                    for Mosaburo Suzuki, who was then the leader of the left-wing Socialist Party.
                    Sam Berger, who had just recently arrived to be the Embassy's Political
                    Counselor, had been trying mightily to make contacts with the Socialist Party
                    and the Sohyo, the largest Japanese labor union. So I interpreted for Sam and
                    Suzuki and in the process I managed to convince Suzuki to set up an appointment
                    for Berger with the head of Sohyo, a Mr. Takamo. Everybody was very happy with
                    the event. I went back to Yokohama and shortly thereafter I heard from the
                    Embassy that I was to be transferred to the Tokyo to be a member of the
                    Political Section. So, after home leave in 1954, I reported for work at the
                    Embassy in Tokyo as second secretary in the Political Section.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to follow internal political matters. The Liberal Democratic Party
                    was just being formed so that Japanese politics were in a state of turmoil.
                    Later, I became the principal contact with Kishi Nobusuke, who was the main
                    founder of the L.D.P. and a subsequent Prime Minister. That was an interesting
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Japan was not yet principally a one-party state, although it was clear that it
                    was headed in that direction. Japanese politics then, as now, was very much a
                    matter of individual leadership with factions springing up here and there.
                    Politics were not essentially a matter of ideology or policies; they revolved
                    more around individual leaders. The battle at the time was between Yoshida, who
                    had been the leader of the Liberal Party, and Hatoyama, who had been his
                    predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party. Hatoyama had had a stroke and had to
                    step aside for a while; when he had recovered, he wanted to reassume his
                    position which had been taken over by Yoshida. Eventually, with an election
                    looming, Hatoyama split from the Liberal Party and formed his own group, which
                    was victorious, making Hatoyama Prime Minister. The Liberal Party lost its
                    majority status and just became one of several conservative parties.</p>
                <p>The role of the individual leaders is a matter of historical tradition in Japan.
                    It was so even before the war. It really goes back to feudal days and the rise
                    of clans. This system of factions, formed around individual leaders, is still
                    true today in one guise or another. We were not really concerned with this form
                    of politics. We were very concerned with the power of left wing parties and
                    factions and were very much opposed to them. In those days, the Socialists were
                    much more of a threat than were the Communist Party, which was stable in size
                    and not growing. In terms of policies, it was the Socialists, and particularly
                    the left wing elements, that seemed to us to be closely linked with the
                    Communists. That was a large party, depending primarily on the resources of the
                    Japanese labor unions.</p>
                <p>There were efforts made to establish a more democratic socialist
                    movement—analogous to a European socialist party— and to inhibit, to the extent
                    possible, the growth of the far left. A split did develop among the
                    socialists—left and right wings. A man named Nishio, probably with the
                    assistance, both overt and covert, of the United States established a more
                    democratic socialist party. The term 'socialist” in Japan meant the same thing
                    it did in the West—a system in which the major means of production were state
                    owned and operated. The left wing socialists were essentially Marxists in terms
                    of philosophy. They did not look to the modern versions of Marxism, like the
                    Soviet Union, as models but rather went back to the early days of socialism for
                    their philosophical base. We are of course discussing events that took place at
                    the peak of the Cold War and therefore the United States tended to look at
                    issues, such as Japan's political situation, in rather black and white
                    terms.</p>
                <p>At the same time, a more democratic labor council was established to combat the
                    influence of the radical Sohyo I don't believe that the AFL-CIO had a full time
                    representative in Tokyo at the time and were not very active, although
                    periodically a representative would come through. The Embassy had a Labor
                    attach� and the CIA had people who covered the labor movement.</p>
                <p>Also the conservative forces in Japan united under the flag of the LDP. They were
                    of course never truly united, but at least marched under the same flag.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was our Tokyo Embassy in the mid-50s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: There were probably about 125 Americans there although I can't be sure
                    because there were so many other agencies' representatives in Tokyo that it was
                    hard to track the number of employees in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>As I said, Sam Berger was the Political Counselor and therefore my boss. His
                    deputy was Bill Leonhart. The DCM was Jeff Parsons, the Ambassador was John
                    Allison. Jules Bassin was our Legal Advisor. It was an active Embassy that
                    worked well. When Allison arrived he decided that there was an over-abundance of
                    reporting and particularly an excess of airgrams. He felt that the reporting
                    should concentrate on the major issues and that not all luncheon conversations
                    needed to be reported. The Embassy had been a prolific papers producer; after
                    Allison took over from Bob Murphy in 1953, the production rate dropped markedly.
                    Much of the Embassy's work fell in the politico-military sphere related to our
                    military presence in Japan. The Japanese military efforts were greatly impeded
                    by their no-war constitution which kept their military capabilities well in
                    restraint. Furthermore, there was not then, in the mid-50s, nor today, any
                    popular support for rearmament or the building of a major defense establishment.
                    In those days, even putting a machine gun on an airplane was viewed as an
                    aggressive military action that the Japanese people strongly opposed. It took
                    years of academic and public discussions to reach agreement that Japan had a
                    right to maintain “self-defense' forces. In the mid-50s we were primarily
                    interested in maintaining absolute freedom to operate as we saw fit from our
                    bases in Japan. Dulles was very anxious to consolidate an eastern arch
                    consisting of countries opposed to the “red” threat. China was a big issue for
                    us at the time. We sought Japanese political support for our Cold War policy
                    positions as well as logistical support for our military activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The Japanese were nervous about China. They looked to us to provide the “nuclear
                    umbrella”. The question was always whether the “umbrella” leaked. I always
                    thought that the question was whether it was raining or was about to rain. We
                    felt that it was raining at the time. We were seriously concerned about the
                    mainland Chinese. The Korean War had just ended in an armistice that has lasted
                    until today. The Soviets had a presence in Tokyo although their people had not
                    been granted diplomatic recognition. They dealt with the Foreign Ministry as an
                    unrecognized foreign entity. The Soviets had established a mission during the
                    SCAP days and had never left even after the end of the military government.
                    There were no formal relations between the USSR and Japan. The Soviets were in
                    effect represented by an unrecognized mission. They maintained their SCAP car
                    license plates and all the other benefits that they had acquired during the
                    military occupation, but in fact did not legally exist in Tokyo. The Soviets
                    have never signed a peace treaty with Japan. This anomaly did create some
                    interesting events. In the mid '50s, ECAFE held its annual meeting in Tokyo.
                    Ambassador Allison gave a large reception for all the delegates. The Soviets
                    were members of the organization and therefore showed up the party even though
                    uninvited. I was at the door and had never seen any members of their mission.
                    The Soviet that showed up was a Mr. Dominsky, who was the head of their
                    unrecognized Tokyo mission. He introduced himself when I met him at the door; I
                    then took him to introduce him to the Ambassador. Dominsky and his colleagues
                    mingled with the guests for a while and then departed. We didn't have regular
                    contacts with the Soviets, although the Foreign Ministry had a Soviet section
                    which kept in contact with the unrecognized mission on an ad hoc basis.</p>
                <p>During this same ECAFE conference, we showed a cinerama film in one of the large
                    Ginza theaters. Cinerama was a big deal at the time; very few people had ever
                    seen it at that time. After the show, I noticed that Dominsky had been in
                    attendance; so I went over and asked him how he had enjoyed the show. He said
                    that it had been very nice, but that the same technique was available in Moscow,
                    except that there were no lines on the film, as there had been on the one we had
                    shown.</p>
                <p>We were in frequent contact with other Western Embassies, particularly the
                    British and also the French, Australians and Canadians. We taught the Canadians,
                    Australians and New Zealanders at our language school in Yokohama. The British
                    had a different tutorial system which they had maintained for many years. At one
                    point, the French asked whether they could send some of their officers to the
                    Yokohama school, but we decided that our training was designed for English
                    speakers and that from a tutorial point of view, it would be very difficult to
                    assimilate speakers of a third language.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In general, would you say that the Embassy in Tokyo in the
                        mid '50s was an effective operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: I was still a very inexperienced officer. This was my first embassy
                    assignment. I thought the Embassy was a good one. We worked well together. We
                    had some brilliant officers assigned there . Sam Berger was essentially removed
                    after a visit by Vice President Nixon in late 1953, before I had actually been
                    assigned to the Embassy, although I had some liaison responsibilities for the
                    visit because of our military presence in the Yokohama district.</p>
                <p>Nixon visited Japan and gave a speech urging Japan to amend its constitution to
                    remove the “no war” clause in light of the great threat to civilization posed by
                    the communists. The speech went over like a big lead balloon. The Japanese
                    wouldn't even consider such an idea, although it was American policy to push
                    them in that direction. During that visit, Nixon had Embassy briefings that are
                    normally provided to high ranking American visitors. I am told, not having been
                    present, that during one of these briefings, Berger was alleged to have said
                    that the Communist Party in Japan was not a threat, but rather it was the
                    Socialists that were a danger. Sam was a conservative on foreign policy issues,
                    having been a member of the AFL-CIO. His claim to fame had been that as Labor
                    Attach� in London he was the only person in the Embassy who had any connections
                    with the Labor government when it took power. That situation is supposed to have
                    changed Foreign Service policy about having regular contacts with opposition
                    parties.</p>
                <p>Nixon was reported to having taken serious offense at Berger's views, stating
                    that anybody anywhere who thought that a Communist Party or member was not a
                    threat to the United States had no business being in the Foreign Service, much
                    less a Political Counselor at a major Embassy. He also is said to have indicated
                    that in any case there were too many Jews as Labor Attach�s and Labor
                    Counselors. I heard this story directly from someone who was present at the
                    meeting. So shortly after I reported for duty at the Embassy, Sam Berger was
                    transferred as DCM in Wellington. He was replaced by George Morgan, who had been
                    the author of a major piece published in Foreign Affairs, which was a follow-on
                    to George Kennan's famous article. George was very scholarly and not very
                    imaginative He had none of the flamboyance that Sam had. That made the Political
                    Section a somewhat duller place and it ran at a slower pace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the officers stationed in the Far East feel neglected

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Not really , because Dulles had a great interest in the Far East and
                    particularly Japan. That was not always a benign interest from Japan's point of
                    view. The recent State Department Historical Office's release of its series on
                    Asia (1955-57) includes a long memorandum of conversation which I wrote after
                    attending a meeting between Dulles and the Japanese high command. At the time we
                    had considered and had decided to return the Bonin Islands to Japan. This was a
                    small group belonging essentially to the Ogasawara Island chain, which we had
                    occupied with a small contingent of Navy personnel. They were supposed to be of
                    some strategic significance; they were supposed to have had some submarine pens,
                    which eventually was discovered not to have been the case, but the Navy had been
                    determined to hold on to them. The process leading up to the decision to return
                    the islands was a big inter-agency battle, but finally common sense won out.
                    There had been about 500 people on the Bonin Islands who had been evacuated to
                    Japan , and after a number of very cold winters in Tokyo wanted to return to
                    those forsaken but nevertheless warm dots on the map. They wanted to return to
                    their homes, such as they were. We had permitted repatriation only of
                    descendants of so-called original settlers—Portuguese and some people from
                    Massachusetts. The original settlers had of course inter-married with Japanese,
                    but their descendants had names like Gonzales and Savory—certainly not Japanese.
                    We had somehow reached the conclusion that people with names like that had been
                    the descendants of the original settlers and were therefore eligible for return,
                    but that was not to be so for people with Japanese family names.</p>
                <p>So Dulles came to Tokyo and , as recorded in my long memorandum, met with senior
                    Japanese officials. I was not the official interpreter, but I was asked to
                    attend the meetings under the guise of being the note-taker so that I could
                    overhear and understand what the Japanese were saying among themselves. Dulles
                    started by saying that we had reached the decision to return the Bonin Islands,
                    but that on his trip to Japan he had changed his mind. That caught everyone's
                    attention, although it was not received favorably by the Japanese. Everybody was
                    wondering what was going on because the Japanese had fully expected a “done
                    deal”. Then Dulles proceeded to say that the U.S. government had decided to make
                    available to the Japanese a certain amount of fissionable material to be used in
                    research reactors. That was supposed to be a sop to the Japanese, who had been
                    interested in having such material, but it was not certainly an acceptable
                    alternative to the return of the Bonin Islands. Hatoyama was the Prime Minister
                    at the time. A Diet member, Frank Matsumoto—a native Japanese, raised in the
                    United States—was being used as a translator. He was of course bilingual. At one
                    moment in the discussion, Frank looked over to me and said: “Bill, what is
                    Japanese for “fissionable material”?. I had no idea how that term was expressed
                    in Japanese, but I had been reading the newspapers' headlines which had been
                    discussing enriched uranium. So I suggested that the term “enriched uranium and
                    things like that” be used to explain fissionable material. All the Japanese
                    nodded their agreement. Dulles turned and looked at me, with an approving
                    glance. Walter Robertson, who was then the Assistant Secretary for East Asia,
                    passed me a note saying that it was most important that the discussion be
                    translated accurately. My reputation was made! There was never any question
                    thereafter about my Japanese language competence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one more question about the 1954-57 period. How would
                        you characterize U.S.- Japan relationships during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I would say that those relationships were positive. The U.S. still
                    considered itself as the mentor and the Japanese, at least in part, accepted
                    that view. They saw the U.S. as its principal ally—its only serious ally. They
                    saw their fate totally bound to U.S. policies and were determined to maintain a
                    close relationship at all costs. They did have their own agenda with their own
                    objectives and were beginning to move towards them. They were looking forward to
                    the day when they could exercise their complete independence, when their economy
                    would be self-sustaining, although they never in the 50's foresaw or even
                    aspired to become a world power, certainly not in military terms or even
                    political.</p>
                <p>On the economic front, the Japanese were rebuilding their base. The advent of the
                    Korean war certainly provided an additional boost since Japan was used as a
                    logistic base for the U.N. operations, but I can still remember that during my
                    Yokohama tour, we were providing free advertising space in Department of
                    Commerce publications for Japanese looking for export opportunities to the U.S.
                    I actually went looking for Japanese to use this free service, especially among
                    those firms that were already in the export business, like paper flowers or
                    handicrafts. At times, I even suggested some approaches to increase exports to
                    the United States. Dulles maintained that there wasn't anything made in Japan of
                    interest to the American consumer. It's amusing to see how well he understood
                    what was beginning to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1957, you were assigned to the Bureau for Intelligence
                        and Research (INR) in the Department of State. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Over my dead body! Mary Jane and I just had our third child toward the
                    end of my tour in Tokyo. It was not an economically propitious time to come to
                    live in Washington. I was still an FSO-5 with a relatively low income which
                    barely kept body and soul together overseas. Ambassador Allison cabled to the
                    Department taking up my case, suggesting that the Shermans be assigned elsewhere
                    overseas. No amount of objections or intervention worked. The last telegram on
                    the subject from the department read: “We regret, but Sherman must return for a
                    Washington tour”.</p>
                <p>So we returned and rented a house in Falls Church, VA. My assignment was the
                    Korea desk of INR. By 1957, the work there was essentially part of the National
                    Intelligence Survey (NIS) program. The U.S. was just waiting for Rhee to
                    disappear from the scene. No new policies were being considered until a new
                    leadership was installed in Seoul. I replaced Dick Petree who had been working
                    on Korea for at least six years before he went to Tokyo on his first Foreign
                    Service assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>INR, in 1957, was a relatively large organization because it had been the
                    beneficiary of large sums from the N.I.S. That program was based on an
                    assumption that it was possible to put together all the intelligence—political,
                    economic, demographic, geographic, etc.— available on a specific country. The
                    U.S. government decided that it would compile this massive country encyclopedic
                    reader from data bases existing in all agencies, especially the intelligence
                    ones. Even the Holy See was included with two sections: one discussing the Holy
                    See as a as a religious society, and one as a temporal power. For an analyst,
                    this compilation was an endless occupation. No soon had a version been written,
                    cleared and published, it was out-of-date, so that analysts had to begin again
                    on an up-date. CIA was the lead agency , and the major financial sponsor. The
                    funds were in part distributed to other agencies and the State's share went
                    essentially to INR which employed a lot of people with those resources. For
                    example, Evelyn Colbert was working on this endless program. As far as I know,
                    those compilations are still in some dusty corner somewhere, but I doubt whether
                    it is ever used; the information gathered in the late '50s was never used then.
                    You have to remember that all this was done before the advent of computers and
                    therefore was a highly human resource intensive effort. We used to send people
                    all over the world to do the research. I took one three month trip to Korea to
                    analyze the educational system in the country to write the chapter on education
                    for the NIS volume. The country volumes, in addition to commentaries, included
                    all of a country's basic documents: the constitution, basic legislation, etc. It
                    was an exhaustive effort, using the “vacuum cleaner” approach to research. We
                    tried to cover every country in the world, although obviously there existed
                    large gaps in certain areas like the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. We even
                    wrote histories for those countries which became a major effort for European
                    countries for example. Much of the material was of course readily available in
                    other forms for anyone who needed to have the information. There was no reason
                    in the world why the government needed to duplicate what was more than
                    adequately covered by experts. Each country analysis had a section on “key
                    country personalities” which provided in-depth biographical summary of every
                    individual who was thought to be a leader or a potential leader. That of course
                    had to be constantly up-dated as circumstances changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Biographic information has of course been standard fare for Foreign Service
                    reporting for many years. I have never felt that it was very useful to conduct
                    strictly as a compartmentalized effort; that is, a self-standing exercise. I
                    remember arriving in Rome and meeting Mary Mack, an older officer in the
                    Political Section. Her full time job was that of biographic reporting officer.
                    That is all she did. You could of course keep as many people busy on that
                    subject as you wish. It is very difficult to decide whom you want to trace. The
                    only time a policy-maker found biographical information useful at all might be
                    during a coup when he or she needed to know something about the new leaders. Too
                    often of course those were not the people we would necessarily have included in
                    our list. In any case, under such circumstances, a post could respond
                    telegraphically with whatever information was needed and available. I should say
                    that there were a lot of defenders of the biographical information system. Of
                    course, many of them were biographic reporting officers, but there were some
                    others. As I said, I never felt that it was worth while. I would make the same
                    comment about CIA's efforts of recent past to provide in-depth psychological
                    profiles of some foreign leaders. I remember talking to some of these fancy
                    psychologists who would come to Tokyo to ask questions such as: “Has Mr. Morita
                    ever had a mid-life crisis?” which to me was a good illustration of the weakness
                    of the exercise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of INR when you served there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: It was Hugh Cumming, who had just been our Ambassador to Indonesia where
                    he had been replaced by John Allison, my former Ambassador in Tokyo. Cumming was
                    still heavily involved in Indonesia issues, as is true for many people who are
                    assigned to Washington. but still living in their precious assignments. Hugh
                    wanted to know all that was going on in Indonesia and would second guess from
                    his Washington vantage point. About six months before I reported to duty in INR,
                    the process of morning briefings had been started. A representative of each INR
                    geographical desk would come in early in the morning and would screen all the
                    overnight cable traffic and many public reporting sources, like wire services
                    and newspapers. These analysts would cull all that material and if they saw
                    material which they deemed sufficiently important, they would brief Bill McAfee
                    who would then digest it further and brief the Director of INR. That worked
                    pretty well for most of the world, but we in the East Asia section, had to
                    include all material that so much as mentioned Indonesia because that was
                    Cumming's wish. He was involved in a complex and personal feud with Allison.
                    They had different perceptions of the situation in Jakarta and differed strongly
                    therefore on policy prescriptions. I never knew enough about Indonesian policy
                    to form a judgement, but I can well remember the exchanges of elaborate
                    telegrams between the two principals. In one, Allison said that the cable he was
                    sending had been drafted primarily by Mary Vance Trent, a political officer at
                    the Embassy and that he had not changed a single word. The analysis in the cable
                    reflected the uncensored views of an observer on the scene, unswayed by
                    Ambassadorial opinion. The message was not lost on Washington. Cumming
                    nevertheless persisted. He sent, under the guise of a NIS mission, an INR
                    officer, Culver Gleysteen, who had served in Indonesia while Cumming was
                    Ambassador. Culver's real assignment was to sent back, in personal letters—not
                    official communication channel—reports on the situation in Indonesia and in the
                    Embassy. That process, particularly reporting on the Embassy, struck me to be
                    somewhat beyond the pale.</p>
                <p>My boss was the Director of the North East Asia Office. That was first Joe Yager
                    and then Bill Magistretti. The Office Director's boss was the Deputy Director of
                    INR. I had a close relationship with the desk officers of the East Asia regional
                    bureau. The desk at the time was run by David Nes, assisted by Chris Norred and
                    Greg Henderson. Chris was an old Korea hand; he was the INR Korea desk officer
                    when I had that temporary assignment to INR when I first joined the Department..
                    He later served twice in Seoul, although not very happily, as I remember it. The
                    regional desk would call on us for assistance, to do research and write reports.
                    This was particularly true for us because Chris had been in INR and had some
                    appreciation for our capabilities. I should mention that I had a colleague in
                    INR who also worked on Korean issues, Dan Sullivan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By 1957, you had been in the Foreign Service for about six
                        years. Had there been changes in the Service during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: We of course went through a convulsion shortly after the arrival of the
                    Eisenhower Administration. Those that survived the serious reduction-in-force
                    were reinvestigated for security/loyalty under the general supervision of Scott
                    McLeod. We had gone through the “some of you may be trustworthy” (enunciated
                    during the first speech to the Department) period of John Foster Dulles. I
                    suppose the Department was not as happy a place as it had been in the '40s.</p>
                <p>In 1955, Wristonization began. As I mentioned, I replaced Dick Petree who had
                    been “Wristonized”. Dick Sneider was “Wristonized” and assigned to Tokyo as
                    politico-military officer. In 1957, the process was still continuing. There was
                    still a lot of turmoil with people still wrestling with the question of whether
                    they should shift to the Foreign Service. There were family tensions with some
                    wives not wishing to leave Washington and leap into the great unknown of
                    overseas living. Also, generally speaking, most of my Foreign Service friends
                    were a little nervous about the integration process because a lot of the
                    “Wristonees” were coming in at higher grades than they were, even though perhaps
                    of the same or younger age, giving rise to concerns about promotional
                    opportunities. There was some resentment of the process and some feeling that
                    the “newcomers” were not as well qualified as those who had been in the Foreign
                    Service. It was a natural reaction that could have been anticipated. But by and
                    large, there was no highly organized or vocal opposition. There was no single
                    Foreign Service voice that took issue with the Wriston report or its
                    implementation. There were undoubtedly a number of highly qualified people who
                    joined the Foreign Service and who went on to have distinguished careers. My
                    problem with “Wristonization” was not that a career system, with essentially
                    entrance only at the bottom, had been breached, but I was concerned that the
                    major thrust of the Wriston report was on its emphasis on specialization. The
                    Foreign Service was no longer to be a group of generalists, who could be
                    expected to do almost any job in the diplomatic sphere. The Wriston program
                    changed that orientation 180%. After the acceptance of the report, the
                    Department and the Foreign Service became specialist oriented. It was a
                    manifestation of the time, with the emphasis on specialization being manifested
                    in other areas like banking, which ceased to rotate its personnel through the
                    various functions and began to hire personnel to spend a career in a
                    specialization like loan or financial investments, etc. This view was then
                    imposed on the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I have always thought that the preponderance of Foreign Service work can be done
                    by a generalist, who has had some experience in the field and therefore has some
                    feel for the needs of Washington in general and the Department of State in
                    specific. The officer must know the country he is working on relatively well and
                    of course, must have some basic competence. The balance of Foreign Service
                    work—probably about 20%—requires specialized knowledge. I have in mind such
                    activities as science, the more esoteric sides of economics-e.g. financial
                    reporting (which is usually done by a Treasury attach� in any case—, labor and
                    agriculture reporting. Most of this work is already being conducted by personnel
                    from other agencies, who are experts in their particular subject field. I would
                    prefer to have a State Department Foreign Service consisting of officers and
                    staff who could be moved from one post to another to perform essentially the
                    same kind of tasks wherever assigned. I don't think the nature of political and
                    economic reporting and the conduct of diplomatic relations varies that greatly
                    from post to post. For the highly specialized technical work, I would prefer
                    that to be left to other agency personnel or by people from the home office in
                    Washington on temporary duty assignments. In many cases, the highly specialized
                    tasks require expert attention for only relatively short periods of time; there
                    is no need for a full time officer being assigned for two years to a post in
                    such situations.</p>
                <p>The role of an Embassy in a foreign country is to provide Washington with
                    political and economic information, analyze the state of the country-US
                    relations and the potential for internal stability, negotiate agreements or
                    treaties, mediate disputes and provide the necessary consular services.
                    essentially an Embassy analyzes, reports and conducts negotiations. Of course,
                    today important negotiations are conducted from Washington by phone or at summit
                    meetings. That range of responsibilities does not require a major research
                    laboratory. The functions I have mentioned should be able to be performed
                    satisfactorily by someone who knows something about the country he is living in
                    who is not necessarily an expert in one functional field or another.</p>
                <p>The Department of State is the coordinator and generator of foreign policy
                    decisions, with the major decisions coordinated by the National Security Council
                    and decided by the President. The NSC is needed because it is the only mechanism
                    now available for settling inter-agency disputes, some of which are real and
                    some which are essentially bureaucratic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In INR, did you get involved very much in the Korean
                        policy development process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Not very much because in those days the theory was that INR was to
                    operate like the Swiss Foreign Office. That was the phrase that was frequently
                    used by INR managers to underline their view that INR officials had no role in
                    policy development. It was INR's responsibility to analyze the facts and to
                    array them so that the regional bureaus and the “seventh floor” could make an
                    informed decision. The theory never worked fully in practice, but that didn't
                    dissuade the proponents. We were asked what the situation was, what factors were
                    affecting that situation, what the likely outcomes might be, etc. INR was
                    supposed to be strictly an objective, neutral analytical organization. It had no
                    operational responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left INR in September, 1958. I gather you could hardly
                        wait to get out. How did you manage to be assigned to the Belgium-Luxembourg
                        desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I was delighted to leave INR. My reassignment was probably the
                    responsibility of John Burns, who had inspected me in Yokohama. I therefore knew
                    him as a friend. He was in 1958 the Executive Director for the Bureau for
                    European Affairs. When the Belgium desk was about to become vacant, I think that
                    John suggested that I be assigned to it. I knew nothing about what was going on.
                    One day, Bill Magistretti called me into his office and said: “As you probably
                    know, there are some efforts being made to assign you to the Belgium desk”. I
                    could barely believe my ears; I had never heard of such a plan and furthermore I
                    thought that my chances would not be very good since I knew nothing about
                    Belgium and had no special qualifications for the job. I was not unhappy to go
                    to EUR, but it certainly came as a major surprise. I don't know that Bill ever
                    believed me, but I had nothing to do with that assignment. I only found out
                    later that it was John Burns who had suggested the transfer, based on his review
                    of my performance in Yokohama and later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about the structure of EUR in 1958. Who was
                        the Assistant Secretary? What was its structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: The Assistant Secretary was Livingston Merchant. The Bureau was
                    organized around European regions: West Europe, East Europe, North Europe, etc.
                    We also had an Office of Regional Affairs, headed by Lane Timmons. The Soviet
                    desk, also part of the East Europe Office, operated as a self-contained unit. It
                    took care of its own personnel and operated pretty much independently of all
                    levels below Assistant Secretary. The Office of Western Europe (WE) was headed
                    by Bob McBride, who succeeded Tully Tolbert when the latter went to Rome as the
                    Political Counselor. WE was divided into sections: Italian-Iberian Affairs,
                    Benelux and Switzerland Affairs, French Affairs. In the Benelux section, we had
                    an officer-in-charge, an economic officer, a desk officer for Belgium-Luxembourg
                    and another for Holland-Switzerland.,</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I had to bring myself up to speed on Benelux affairs in a hurry because shortly
                    after I took over the desk, King Baudouin visited the United States. I suspect
                    that it was the first time that any senior level of the U.S. government had to
                    become knowledgeable about Belgian affairs. Belgium was a small country, but I
                    found it very interesting. I had a lot of fun on that desk.</p>
                <p>Belgium and Luxembourg did not have a very high priority on the list of foreign
                    policy issues facing the Bureau of European Affairs or even the Office of
                    Western European Affairs. De Gaulle was at his orneriest forcing the Office
                    Director and Deputy Director to focus essentially on France. After that, for
                    them, the important agenda items concerned Italy and the Iberian Peninsula.
                    Benelux did not appear on their screen very often. Our division ran itself,
                    largely unsupervised. So, as an FSO-4, I was left pretty much to my own
                    devices.</p>
                <p>The Belgian and Luxembourg Embassies in Washington were accustomed to dealing
                    with the desk officer. Their Ambassadors did not demand to see the Secretary of
                    State or the Assistant Secretary every time they had a request. We at the desk
                    officer level were able to handle most of their concerns. The Belgian
                    Ambassador, Bobby Silvercruys, rarely came to the Department. At one point, he
                    was the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, a position which goes to the ambassador
                    with the longest service in Washington. He had married Rosemarie McMahon, the
                    widow of the late Senator. So he knew his way around town quite well and didn't
                    really need the Department's assistance. Occasionally he might wish to see Bob
                    Murphy, the Under Secretary, or another high level Department official. On those
                    occasion, I would accompany the Ambassador on his call, but that was the extent
                    of the services we had to provide the Belgian Ambassador.</p>
                <p>The Luxembourg Ambassador changed while I was on the desk. George Heisbourg, who
                    had been the principal secretary of the Foreign Ministry, came as the Ambassador
                    from Luxembourg. He went about making all his calls, which we had arranged for
                    him. I accompanied him to these meetings. He could not have been nicer. We were
                    frequent dinner guests at his Embassy. The Luxembourgers were known for their
                    pro-American attitude and were always warmly received wherever they went. I made
                    one trip to Luxembourg and Belgium at the end of a fiscal year to use up some
                    leftover funds. I spent a week in Belgium and three or four days in Luxembourg.
                    When you walk passed the Foreign Ministry in Luxembourg, the windows were wide
                    open; anyone could have reach in and taken all the papers off the a desk. I, a
                    lowly desk officer, called on the Prime Minister one morning. In the afternoon,
                    I attended a parliament session and sat in the VIP gallery. The Prime Minister
                    walked in, looked up and waved at us. Luxembourg was very casual.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Of course, there is a long history of US-Luxembourg relationships, made
                    immemorial by Perle Mesta. Even before that, we had as Charge a career Foreign
                    Service officer, George Platt Waller. He was “crown happy” as Wiley Buchanan
                    used to describe him. He emphasized his relationship with the Grand Duchess, not
                    just the Duchess. He used to caution everyone to use the correct title for the
                    lady. He wrote a despatch that was preserved at the FSI for a long time in which
                    he described at some length the extreme conditions that were imposed on
                    Luxembourg when it was invaded by the Nazis. He stayed there, maintaining a
                    presence. We often read George Platt Waller's despatches because they were so
                    typical of an era long past. In one, he wrote; “ To the Honorable Secretary of
                    State: Sir: I have the honor to report that yesterday the remains of St. John
                    the Blind, were returned to their historical resting place, the Cathedral in the
                    Grand Square of Luxembourg City. As the Department will recall, St. John the
                    Blind died in 1539........I remain your obedient servant, George Platt Waller”.
                    That was his style and he was one of the last to write that way!</p>
                <p>It was these episodes that led me to say that “I had fun on the desk”. I had some
                    contacts with other agencies, but they were somewhat limited. For example, when
                    the French Defense Minister came, I took him over to call on the Secretary of
                    Defense and his Deputy. Then ColoneVernon “Dick “ Walters was the translator. I
                    became acquainted with some of the other agencies when I took Ambassador
                    Heisbourg around on his calls. The government had not at that time established a
                    Country Director system so that my contacts with other agencies were somewhat
                    limited.</p>
                <p>One event that I can still recall was the tenth anniversary celebration of NATO.
                    The headquarters were still in Paris. The anniversary celebration was held here
                    in Washington and was attended by all the head of governments. That was a major
                    event, which kept us busy for some weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were assigned to Rome. How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It happened much to my surprise. One day, as I was happily working on
                    the Belgium/Luxembourg desk, Wells Stabler, who had become the Office Director
                    for Italian/ Austrian Affairs after having been Benelux Office Director, called
                    and asked me to stop by his office. He told me that, as I may have already
                    heard, Outerbridge Horsey, then DCM in Rome, had requested that I be assigned to
                    Rome. Horsey had been the DCM in Tokyo during the last few months of my tour
                    there. I had not heard of Horsey's request and I was surprised that Outerbridge
                    would even remember who I was. These were still the days in the Foreign Service
                    when an Ambassador and a DCM could request or reject almost any assignments to a
                    post in their country. The vacancy in Rome was not to occur until the following
                    year. I was to replace Gus Velletri in the Political Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Horsey's advice to me was that I attend early morning Italian lessons at FSI
                    starting almost immediately. The assignment was made well in advance of our
                    departure and I did study Italian at FSI. I continued that at the end of my tour
                    on the desk because my replacement arrived a couple of months before my
                    departure time allowing me to study Italian full time. That gave me a language
                    rating of 3/3 by the time I arrived in Rome (sufficient to converse easily, but
                    not bilingual). The ability to communicate in Italian was a great help. In
                    Japan, people used to arrive without knowing a word of Japanese and left after
                    their tour without knowing much more of the language. But in Italy, that was not
                    possible. From the moment you arrived, you had to be able to navigate in the
                    language.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, I found there was a major policy dispute the between the
                    Political Section and Outerbridge Horsey and Tully Torbert, who was the
                    Political Counselor. The issue was the question of a center-left coalition to
                    govern Italy. Velletri was a strong advocate for the US to support such a
                    coalition. Horsey was very much opposed. The Political Section position to which
                    I had been assigned was responsible for liaison with the Christian Democratic
                    Party, the Liberal Party and the Vatican. so I was in the middle of things. For
                    a while at least I could plead newness on the job to avoid taking a position on
                    the dispute..</p>
                <p>I think it was Velletri had actually started the work with the Vatican. He had
                    some family connections with officials in the Vatican. Horsey also had a lot of
                    personal connections in the Vatican. His sister was a nun and he was a devoted
                    Catholic. But Pius XII had laid down a dictum that there would be no relations,
                    formal or informal, with governments that did not officially recognize the Holy
                    See. So when Velletri went to the Vatican, he went in an unmarked car without CD
                    license plates. Of course, senior Vatican officials were well aware of Gus'
                    visits, they publicly denied any connections with the American government. By
                    the time I arrived, the patten had been pretty well established and, when
                    required, I could go to see Archbishop Dell'aqua, who in effect ran the
                    Vatican's Foreign Ministry. He was not actually the Cardinal who was the
                    Secretary of State, but he did manage the Vatican's foreign affairs on a
                    day-by-day basis. So I could see him when necessary, but my usual contact was
                    with Monsignor Cardinale, the so-called Chief of Protocol.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>When the Ecumenical Council was convened, we made it clear to the Vatican that we
                    were interested in the meetings. We talked to Cardinale often during this period
                    as well as to the American Cardinals who attended the Council. The Ambassador
                    was very interested and that helped. He would go to the Vatican, after I made
                    the necessary arrangements, seeing the Pope or any official that he wanted to
                    see. We were invited as official “guests” of the Vatican for the opening of the
                    Council. So that even with Pius's restriction, we had adequate access to him and
                    his staff. When Horsey went, he went as a private person. In light of the
                    sensitivities on both sides, the Ambassador had established a rule that only he
                    and I would be allowed to visit or contact the Vatican officially. He was trying
                    to avoid any semblance of official connections between the US and the Vatican,
                    especially in light the political sensitivity of President Kennedy's position as
                    the first Catholic president. Once Pius XII died, the official restrictions were
                    lifted. John XXIII couldn't have cared less whether there were formal
                    relationships. Paul VI was the same way; no one mentioned the Concordat or any
                    other formal limitations on contacts.</p>
                <p>Vatican II started in 1961—Vatican I had taken place sixty years earlier. It had
                    a number of sessions over an extended period of time. For each sessions, all the
                    Catholic leaders —Cardinals and bishops—around the world would come to Rome.
                    They would meet in Council for three months and then would return to their
                    dioceses. Then they would come back to Rome. The Sacred Congregations (similar
                    to ministries in a secular government) and the special committees of the Council
                    stayed essentially in permanent session, but the Plenary sessions were convened
                    periodically and then lasted for three or four months. We tried to stay in touch
                    with the American prelates in attendance, particularly the active ones. The
                    American Jewish Committee was very interested in the proceedings because the
                    Council did discuss its historical and current relationships with the Jewish
                    community. The Council did produce a new statement (a schema) on Catholic-Jewish
                    relations. It was important to the American Jewish community that the statement
                    be as forthcoming as possible. So we followed the progress on that issue. We
                    arranged for meeting between the Jewish and Catholic leaders. It was a narrow
                    line that we walked because we couldn't give any semblance of becoming involved
                    in what were essentially church issues. We were very mindful of the separation
                    of church and state under our Constitution as well as the appearance of any
                    impropriety . President Kennedy was certainly not anxious to give any impression
                    of personal involvement or interest, although I think that the White House did
                    follow the Council's proceedings quite closely. As I said, Salinger maintained
                    contact with the Vatican even before Kennedy's visit. Washington did not show
                    any official concern or express interest in the Council's proceedings, but no
                    one ever told us not to report.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Beyond the Council's meetings, we were also interested in the Vatican's
                    information on events behind the Iron Curtain. They had good sources, but it was
                    not, as many have suggested, a great depository of information. It had a lot of
                    intelligence, but it was primarily church related. They knew about their bishops
                    and converts and church attendance and what churches had been closed; that was
                    of limited interest to the United States government. The Vatican was
                    incidentally only aware of security or political intelligence. It was more
                    active in some places than others, but by and large, its information concerned
                    religious matters and not issues of interest to a country's government. We had
                    practically no requests from Washington to pursue any particular matter, so I
                    was pretty much left to my own devices on what issues to pursue and report.</p>
                <p>We did have conversations with the Vatican about China. The church was
                    essentially out of business in China and therefore not a very fruitful source. I
                    used to see Cardinale about every other week; we were on the phone frequently,
                    but many of these meetings and conversations dealt with visitors. We did
                    institute a series of lunches hosted by the Ambassador for various Cardinals—we
                    rarely had two at the same time. The discussions around the table were mostly
                    philosophical. He invited all the leading church theologists—John Courtney
                    Murray, Malachi Martin, Xavier Renn and Cardinal Bea. These were mostly Jesuit
                    commentators on church developments. Bea was a German who had started as a
                    simple priest and suddenly been named a Cardinal without going through any of
                    the intermediate stages. He was most active in coalescing the Council. These
                    lunches were unrelated to Embassy business, but were intended to pursue some of
                    Reinhardt's personal interests, although some of the conversation was recorded
                    in despatches to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about who the various officials in
                        the Embassy were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: When I arrived, the Ambassador was James David Zellerbach. He was
                    followed a few months later by G. Frederick Reinhardt. The DCM was Outerbridge
                    Horsey first; he was followed by Frances Williamson. The Political Counselor was
                    Torbert when I arrived; he left soon thereafter and John Auchincloss was acting
                    head. Then Terry B. Sanders was assigned as Political Counselor. He had had no
                    previous experience in Italian matters and was an impossible man to work for—the
                    worst boss I ever worked for. He stayed a little more than a year and then was
                    followed by Bill Fraleigh. Jack Herfurt was the Administrative Counselor. He had
                    followed Leo Gentner. The Economic Counselor was Sydney Mellen, who had followed
                    Gardner Ainsworth.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I think the Embassy functioned reasonably well. We had very good language
                    capability. Even most of the secretaries spoke Italian. That was almost a
                    necessity because at that time, many Italians would speak only Italian and the
                    secretaries had to be able to respond. All officers spoke Italian, certainly
                    enough to get along. Some were bilingual almost. The USIS operated well. The
                    Consular Section was busy and handled its work-load efficiently. The Political
                    Section was active. The relationships between the various sections of the
                    Embassy were good. I don't remember any policy disputes that occurred except for
                    question of whether the United States should support a left-center coalition.
                    That important and probably key US policy question was essentially a political
                    issue dealt with by the Political section. I was of course also interested in
                    the Vatican Council. Economic questions were pretty much relegated to the
                    back-burner because Italy was at the time enjoying “the Italian miracle”. There
                    were some trade problems on such things as shoes, which were usually stimulated
                    by one U.S. politico or another, but there were never any serious trade or
                    economic issues between the two countries.</p>
                <p>Life in Rome was pleasant enough. The office was generally pleasant. It was not
                    so for Bill Fraleigh because he felt that he was being by-passed on matters that
                    were in his area of jurisdiction. The main bone of contention of course were the
                    Vatican issues because he had some friends there with whom he maintained contact
                    and whom he believed should have been consulted. It was an unusual situation. My
                    colleague, Steve Peters, who was the contact man with the Socialist Party,
                    entertained members of that Party frequently. Bill Fraleigh was of course
                    dutifully invited to all these affairs. The Socialists were anxious to meet with
                    U.S. government officials; they welcomed any invitations from U.S. Embassy
                    staff. Those contacts were important to them.</p>
                <p>The Christian Democrats—the Party that I covered—had no particular interest in
                    the U.S. Embassy. They were reluctant participants in any American social
                    occasions. They were the governing party and didn't feel that contacts with
                    Americans were of particular benefit to them. Getting appointments in their
                    offices with them was difficult. When I did get a chance of meeting, it more
                    likely than not to be a cup of coffee late at night on the Piazza Navona. It was
                    unusual that they would show up for a dinner party. They might accept, but would
                    usually call at the last minute and cancel. So that was nearly impossible for me
                    to introduce Fraleigh to the Christian Democrats as Peters did for the
                    Socialists. I think that added to Fraleigh's frustrations and concerns that I
                    was keeping information and contacts from him.</p>
                <p>My relationships with the Political Counselor were also complicated because I was
                    a very close friend with the DCM, Francis Williamson. That, I am sure, added to
                    Fraleigh's unhappiness. Francis died while in Rome and after that, Fraleigh
                    wrote a very damaging efficiency report.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Like all large European Embassies, Rome lacked close cohesion after work. There
                    was not much social interchange among the officers. It was not at all like
                    Tokyo, where there was a good deal of Embassy community activity which stemmed
                    in part from the fact that all the staff as housed relatively closely together.
                    It was very difficult to settle in Rome. First there was the Italian way of
                    doing things—the landlords, the service industry, etc. The Embassy provided
                    virtually no assistance to newly arriving staff. An officer was on his or her
                    own to find living accommodations, negotiate the lease, pay bills, etc. It was a
                    difficult adjustment for someone who had just arrived from an Embassy like
                    Tokyo. Of course, in Rome, the top-ranking officers—Ambassador, DCM, the
                    Counselors—and the staff lived in government-owned housing and they didn't have
                    the same problems as the more middle grade and junior officers had. It was only
                    later that I recognized how many of those personnel problems Bill Crockett had
                    tried to address as Administrative Counselor in Rome, for which he was severely
                    criticized by the Inspectors and others. Staff morale was relatively good,
                    although, again as in all European capitals, the staff corps people are largely
                    ignored because the assumption is that anybody living in “the lap of luxury”
                    should be able to navigate on their own. Anyone who could not enjoy one of those
                    posts was obviously the one at fault and not the system. The single women had a
                    difficult social circumstance in the Italian world. It was not a hospitable
                    atmosphere for a single woman. Unless in the company of another woman or an
                    American male, they were prey to the well-known Italian male predilections. The
                    Embassy showed absolutely no concern for that problem, which was a serious
                    morale issue. The Embassy did not organize any after-work hours activities. Mary
                    Jane and I started a small theater group as we had done at every other post we
                    had served in. We put up a set and the actors read from scripts, but went
                    through the on stage action. It became very popular and that group went on for
                    some years after we left Rome. We had a lot of fun. We also performed in some
                    regular theater productions. The Embassy gave us no support, but the Ambassador
                    and other members of the staff came to watch.</p>
                <p>The Zellerbachs had Embassy people at their official functions. They were called
                    “co-hosts” and assigned specific functions, like keeping people from wandering
                    upstairs to the family quarters, making sure that everybody was being served and
                    that they all would leave at the appropriate time. It was very formal. The
                    invited Embassy staff had to arrive fifteen minutes before the guests. Mrs.
                    Zellerbach would brief us on what needed to be done, etc. The Reinhardts were
                    much more informal. They would also invite Embassy staff, but they were treated
                    more as guests than as hired waiters. Mrs. Reinhardt had very definite ideas
                    about the Foreign Service, which she has frequently expressed in places like the
                    Foreign Service Journal after the Ambassador's death. She was considerably
                    younger than Freddie and they had young children. So the whole atmosphere at the
                    Residence was much more relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the views of the Embassy on the internal
                        political situation in Italy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: There was a huge problem which was dumped on me as soon as I arrived. It
                    revolved around a center-left coalition. There were a substantial number of
                    officers in the Political section, primarily the more junior ones—George Lister,
                    Clayton Mudd, Gus Velletri and others—who believed that the way to maintain
                    democracy in Italy and to keep the Communists out of power, was to bring the
                    Socialists into the government—the so called “opening to the left”. That
                    strategy had been vigorously opposed by earlier Christian Democratic leaders
                    like De Gasperi, and certainly by the Catholic Church. These groups felt that
                    any contacts with the Socialists should be taboo. The leadership of the CD
                    consisted primarily of conservatives who were unalterably opposed to the
                    “Opening”. The debate about the political strategy was an open and wide ranging
                    debate in Italy. Some Embassy staffers supported the “Opening” strategy; others
                    supported the maintenance of a pure CD government. Outerbridge Horsey and Tully
                    Tolbert strongly supported the position that the Socialists be kept out of the
                    government. They did not object to us maintaining contacts with the Socialist
                    Party or reporting on its activities, but our reporting was carefully edited to
                    avoid giving any impression that the Socialists were part of a “democratic”
                    family or that they would assist in the containment of the Communists if they
                    were ever to share governmental powers. Our reporting tended to suggest that the
                    Socialists, if in the government, would assist the Communists in acquiring
                    greater power. Pietro Nenni, the Socialist leader, was viewed as just as much of
                    an enemy as Togliatti, the Communist boss. The Ambassador did not come down on
                    one side or another.</p>
                <p>George Lister was our main reporter on the Socialist Party. He had most of the
                    contacts. Whenever he would write his reports, his commentary and approach would
                    be generally favorable and benign towards the Socialists and the center-left
                    points of view. By the time Outerbridge Horsey got finished with his review, the
                    draft report would be substantially altered to alter any favorable references to
                    the Socialists or would include countervailing views. At times, the redrafting
                    was so drastic that George Lister would refuse to be shown as the drafting
                    officer. I would guess that more than half of the reports out of the Embassy
                    therefore would show Outerbridge Horsey as drafting officer. Outer felt very
                    strongly about the US taking a firm stance against the “Opening to the
                    Left”.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I would guess that Horsey approved my assignment to Italy because
                    I had had no previous Italian experience and he must have felt that he could
                    control my views and keep me on the “straight and narrow”. In fact, that was not
                    the result. I found myself more and more sympathizing with a new center-left
                    strategy. I might not have been as extreme as George, but I was certainly more
                    supportive of that Christian Democratic faction, led by Aldo Moro, who believed
                    that the CD was the party of center moving to the left. That, of course, implied
                    first a closer relationship with the Social Democrats, under Saragat, and
                    eventually to the Socialist Party. Moro and his faction were vigorously opposed
                    by the Doroteii (named after the church where that faction first met), led by
                    Flaminio Piccoli and Mario Scelba—conservatives who did not want any
                    relationships with any part of the Left. The fight among the Christian Democrats
                    was fierce. It was fascinating to observe. I was greatly impressed by Moro,
                    particularly by his performance at a major CD meeting in Naples. He spoke at
                    about 2 a.m. with great passion; it was a major piece of political drama during
                    which Moro expressed his views of the future, his fears, his dreams and hopes.
                    It was oratory at its best. I became a devotee of Moro's and his strategy.</p>
                <p>So I too began to have differing views from Outerbridge Horsey and had
                    discussions with him. Of course, he saw current events through a prism of long
                    experience in Italy which went back to the pre-war days; it was difficult
                    therefore to argue with him in a historical context when you hadn't had the same
                    experience. He had present at the birth of the CD; he had known De Gasperi well.
                    He had strong feelings about the Communists; he was close to the Catholic Church
                    and very sympathetic to its position, which was relatively inflexible.</p>
                <p>There was a comparable and simultaneous debate in Washington on this major
                    political issue. The Office of Western European Affairs tended to support the
                    Horsey position; INR, where John DeSciullo was the major Italian analyst,
                    supported the “Opening to the Left” position. There were others in town who
                    agreed with INR. Sometimes, the officers on the Italy desk would “run off the
                    reservation” and show some tilt towards the more liberal position. The Embassy
                    was always concerned with the selection of the Italian desk officer because it
                    wanted to make sure that it had a vigorous defender of the faith in the right
                    place in Washington.</p>
                <p>Before the Kennedy visit, Arthur Schlesinger came to Rome to review the political
                    situation. George Lister was his control officer. He took the opportunity to
                    unburden himself on his problems with his bosses during their trip in from the
                    airport. Schlesinger, in his book, noted that Outerbridge Horsey was leading the
                    Embassy down the wrong policy lane. He said that the Kennedy Administration, in
                    general, supported Christian Democratic movements in the world and that it tried
                    to get European support for Frei in Chile, for example. He suggested that
                    Kennedy supported movements that leaned to the left such as worker-priests, etc.
                    I believe, that as result of Schlesinger's visit, Outerbridge Horsey was
                    eventually moved from Italian affairs in 1962 and sent to Czechoslovakia as
                    Ambassador.</p>

                        day-to-day activities? Did the US government's internal debate have any

                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It probably did. We had a complicated arrangement, which included the
                    work of other agencies which followed Italian politics closely, especially CIA.
                    There was a degree of U.S. financial assistance to certain political
                    institutions, but I don't know the details because I was never privy to them or
                    directly involved. That assistance had started, I am sure, before my arrival in
                    Rome and was still going on while I was there.</p>
                <p>The basic U.S. objective was to frustrate the Italian Communist Party by any
                    means possible. The debate was not over the broad goal; it was over the means to
                    accomplish the objective. The question was how best to fight the Communists.
                    There was not a more dedicated anti-Communist in the world than George Lister.
                    He was more passionate about that than Horsey was. But he felt that the best
                    means to defeat the Communists was by encouraging the Socialists to split
                    irrevocably from the far left through a center-left coalition. He also thought
                    that the ultra-conservative leadership of the CD should be frustrated. Horsey
                    supported the conservatives and so did some of Horsey's successors. Graham
                    Martin, when he was Ambassador, reinvigorated the old civic committees which had
                    been established to push ultra conservative policies in the CD party. No one
                    went so far as to support the MSI (the crypto-Fascist Party) nor the Monarchist
                    Party. It should be noted that the Communists at this period were receiving
                    almost the same percentage of the vote as the Christian Democrats (mid-20%).
                    They were particularly strong in some local elections and especially in the “Red
                    Belt”—Tuscany, Romagna. So they were a potent political force in Italy, although
                    quite different from their French and other counterparts. The Italian Communists
                    leadership consisted of rich, capitalist people. They had TVs, refrigerators,
                    cars; they lived comfortably. When a Sicilian traveled north to Milan, for
                    example, to find a job, he would probably be met and welcomed by a local
                    Communist Party official, who found lodging and a job for him. The Communists
                    would take care of these new “immigrants”. That is how they built their power
                    base. They operated a political machine which took great pains to take care of
                    its “grass roots” supporters and potential voters.</p>

                <p>The Communist Party did follow the lead of the USSR on foreign policy issues, but
                    it didn't really spend much time on those issues. Italy under a Communist
                    government, would have been just as difficult as Italy was under other
                    governments. Italians usually don't vote for a Party or a person; they vote
                    against. If the Communists had been the government, they too would have suffered
                    the anger and complaints of the voters, like the CD did. Anything that went
                    wrong, either for the state or an individual, would have been the government's
                    fault regardless of Party in power. Knowing this predilection, the Communists
                    preferred to be outside the government. There was a wonderful satirical movie
                    made in which the CD members were in a room watching the election returns. The
                    American Ambassador was also in the room. The scene has the returns indicating a
                    Communist victory. Then the set changes to the room occupied by the Communists,
                    who are becoming increasingly disturbed by the possibility of a victory as the
                    CD people were dismayed by the possibility of defeat! It was a wonderful
                    commentary, which not only illustrated the political scene in Italy, but also
                    the Italians' ability to laugh at themselves.</p>
                <p>But the intra-Embassy debate was a healthy one; it was out in the open. No one's
                    opinion was being suppressed. Horsey did alter reporting cables because he felt
                    that he was the senior representative of the Embassy, but the disagreements
                    among the staff were well known in Washington.</p>
                <p>Some one said that the “Political situation in Italy was desperate, but not
                    serious!”. That is the way it was. The political system was crumbling even in
                    the early '60s. Nowhere else in the world could one find 35 governments in 30
                    years. Governments were always falling. The process worked, but only because
                    band-aids were being applied to it from day to day. There was no coherence. Some
                    policies were agreed on, but there wasn't any political leadership strong enough
                    to wend its way through the bureaucracy, much less change its culture.
                    Government was viewed as an impediment, not as an avenue for change. The
                    bureaucracy was an employer and a large one at that. The political system
                    generated confusion, not clarity or national goals. The government was always in
                    shambles. Even in those days, everyone was aware of the bustarello—the little
                    white envelope stuffed with money that was handed to one official or
                    another.</p>
                <p>The economic system, on the other hand, was booming. The “Italian miracle” was in
                    full swing in the '60s. Everything was great. People lived better and better and
                    were full of optimism, even for Italians. Everybody had a job and felt secure.
                    The South, which as always was the “economic basket case”, was being helped by
                    emigration to the North. Newspapers were flourishing giving great opportunities
                    for public debates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about Vice President Johnson's visits.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: There were two Johnson visits. The first was in 1962 on a stop in a long
                    journey. He and Mrs. Johnson and Lynda Bird were in Rome rather briefly. My
                    responsibility was to take the party to the Vatican for an audience with the
                    Pope. Lynda was, at the time, in love with some Lieutenant (JG). who was
                    stationed in Naples. She was 18 or 19 at the time. Bill Crockett was the State
                    Department's honcho on that trip. I remember that because at the time, Johnson's
                    foreign policy advisor, who was a Foreign service officer was leaving and the
                    Ambassador and Jack Herfurt, the Administrative Counselor were pushing me to be
                    his replacement. That was the first time I met Crockett. The visit went off
                    without any major hitches that I can remember, although Johnson acted as he did
                    on all trips. That was the trip on which he decided he wanted to buy some
                    Italian neckties. Outerbridge Horsey was sent across the street to bring back to
                    the hotel a sample of 500 neck-ties. Johnson would select ten and pay half the
                    price asked for by the shop-keeper. I can still see Outer sitting in the hotel
                    suite's waiting room, saying: “I am just not going to do that!. I am just not
                    going to do that!”. But he had little choice.</p>
                <p>The second visit came after the Pope died in April, 1963. This time, the Vice
                    President came without his family, although he had a large delegation along,
                    including Jim Farley, an Afro-American clergyman, a Congressman, etc. He stayed
                    at the newly opened Cavalieri Hilton. The hotel gave him —very aptly—the
                    “Petronius Suite” which was on the top floor. Jack Valenti, in his normal
                    officious persona, ran around checking everything—the soap, the Cutty Sark
                    bottle and all the other pet demands that went with a Johnson visit. Johnson
                    went into the bathroom and read the USIA Bulletin there which featured his
                    picture on the cover. He couldn't stand any pictures of himself; it was always
                    the photographer's fault. In this case, in addition, it was also USIA's fault
                    for using his picture. He demanded that all the copies of the Bulletin be
                    destroyed and be replaced with an edition using a line drawing of himself that
                    pleased him. And so it was done.</p>
                <p>Vatican ceremonies are interminable. They go on forever—four, six hours. There
                    was Johnson sitting in his white tie and tails, without any staff or entourage
                    around him. He was surrounded by other world officials and diplomats with whom
                    he had nothing in common. I have still have pictures of him, looking around
                    fiercely, obviously very unhappy and uncomfortable. Finally, the ceremony ended
                    and Johnson returned to the hotel for a club sandwich. The sandwich had too much
                    mayonnaise on it which gave him indigestion. But he had to make a call on
                    Italian President Segni. The State Department had not sent an interpreter, for
                    reasons that I still can not fathom. So I was chosen and became the official
                    interpreter for a meeting between the President of Italy and the Vice-President
                    of the United States. It was not an easy chore and I faced the prospect with a
                    great deal of trepidation. But the meeting went off all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>It was right after that meeting that I also interpreted for Johnson while he
                    wondered the streets of Rome, shaking “flesh”. We stopped in Trastevere, in a
                    store where he bargained for a rubber raft for one of his daughters. The
                    shop-keeper kept saying: “Questi sono pressi fixe” (”These are fixed prices”). I
                    kept pointing out that this was the Vice President of the United States and
                    asking that she make a deal. She would not give a lira! Of course, Johnson
                    didn't pay for any of these purchases anyway. There was a “bag man” along.</p>
                <p>I still have a tape recording, made by USIA man, of that walk during which
                    Johnson repeated how important the Italian immigrants were to the United States
                    and how he had appointed one to a Cabinet post. Of course, as luck would have
                    it, the first people we met were German tourists, and I don't speak German. But
                    Johnson persevered on, handing out Senate gallery passes and ball point pens
                    with his signature on them. One of the local people came up to me to inquire who
                    the VIP was—he thought it might be Mr. Hilton. I translated that as well.
                    Finally, we wound up back at the Hilton, only to run into Mary McGrory who
                    happened to be in Rome on vacation—she is a great Italophile. Doris Fleeson's
                    daughter, Doris Anthony, was a press attach� at the Embassy and she was there as
                    well. Johnson turned to me and whispered ; “You have done good! Now tell me who
                    that is that just greeted me and asked to speak to me”. I told him that was Mary
                    McGrory. So he turned to McGrory and said: “Hello, Mary. Good to see you!”. It
                    was an amusing day!.</p>
                <p>It was a busy month because Johnson came at about the same time as Humphrey
                    visited and just before the Chief Justice, Earl Warren came. Warren came as head
                    of a delegation that included Mike Mansfield, Charles Englehardt (the minerals
                    king), and Rabbi Lewis Finkelstein. That delegation was the official US
                    representation for the coronation of Pope Paul VI. Immediately thereafter,
                    President John Kennedy arrived. So within a three week period, the Embassy
                    hosted the President, the Vice-President and the Chief Justice and some other
                    well known politicians, all of whom wanted to see the Pope, which made the
                    groups my responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Kennedy waited in Milan until the coronation ceremonies were completed so that he
                    wouldn't interfere with the Warren delegation. So we had Johnson, followed
                    almost immediately by Warren, who was followed immediately by Kennedy. President
                    Kennedy was in Rome for three days. The first two days were devoted to US-Italy
                    bilateral issues. The third day was reserved for the Vatican. As I mentioned,
                    plans for a Kennedy-Pope John XXIII had been worked out earlier through
                    non-State Department channels. But by the time the visit came, there was a new
                    Pope. So the visit did not go as smoothly as might have otherwise. First of all,
                    there was a big battle between the State Department and the Vatican Protocol
                    staff concerning who would attend the audience. The White House wanted to have a
                    large group present, but didn't want to list every one as members of the
                    official party because that would not be good public relations-wise. The
                    Vatican, on the other hand, was equally determined that only people listed as
                    official members of the presidential party, would permitted to attend.
                    Furthermore, the Vatican Chief of Protocol wanted to call on the President
                    before the audience. I tried to arrange that, but Kennedy would have no part of
                    it. The Chief of Protocol could see the Secretary of State if he wanted, but
                    that wasn't satisfactory. So the Chief of Protocol's nose was out of joint. When
                    we arrived at the Cortile San Damaso where the entrance to the Pope's offices
                    were, we were met by a mob scene, with everybody in Rome seemingly trying to get
                    into the elevators. The protocol people were trying to clear a path for Kennedy.
                    Finally we ran into the last hurdle which were the Swiss guards who were under
                    instructions to let in only the members of the official party. The head of the
                    Secret Service, who was more Catholic than the Pope, got very upset and was
                    furious with me, wanting to know what I was going to do about this mess. At that
                    point I saw Archbishop Dell'aqua hurrying through the crowd so that he could
                    participate in the audience. I grabbed his cassock and told him that we had a
                    problem. I also grabbed Angier Biddle Duke, who was the U.S. Chief of Protocol
                    and I got the two to talk about who was to be let in. The Swiss guard, who had
                    been so steadfast in his refusal to let anyone in not listed, was finally
                    subdued and the whole group was allowed to enter into the chamber. Only Evelyn
                    Lincoln was blocked because she was told that her costume did not meet
                    standards; her blouse was too see-through. The Swiss guard would not let her in.
                    She finally had to borrow a jacket from one of the newspaper people and that
                    passed muster.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Swiss Guard was still furious with me for having found a way
                    to get the non-listed people into the audience. They kept looking at the
                    newspapermen who were in their usual scruffy duds; they shook their heads in
                    great disapproval of an Papal audience's dress code. The newspaper people were
                    being equally pugnacious and ignoring the Swiss Guard's comments entirely. It
                    was a circus! There had been no opportunity to brief the President about Vatican
                    protocol or about how an audience was conducted. Finally someone decided that it
                    would be wise if I could ride with Kennedy to the Vatican to brief him in the
                    limousine. So I dutifully showed up at the Villa Taverna—the Ambassadorial
                    Residence where the President was staying. Kennedy and Dean Rusk came out and
                    got into the limousine. I got in and sat on a jump seat.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I immediately found out that the President didn't want to talk about Vatican
                    protocol; he wanted to be briefed about Italian politics. He had met with most
                    of the political leaders the night before at the Quirinale, including Togliatti,
                    the Communist leader. Mary Jane and I had been invited to mingle with the guests
                    after dinner in the garden. Kennedy had some Language Service interpreters with
                    him, so that the Embassy staff didn't have to fill in this time. He met and
                    talked with the party leaders then; he met and shook hands with Togliatti. It
                    was a situation that couldn't be helped. the host for the dinner and the party
                    afterwards was the President of Italy; he could not exclude the Communists.</p>
                <p>In any case, on the ride to the Vatican, Kennedy wanted to talk about Italian
                    politics. So that is what we talked about. Periodically he would turn his head
                    towards the window and wave to the crowd. The first time he did that, I stopped
                    talking. Kennedy said: “Don't stop talking; I can listen and wave at the same
                    time!”. Then he said he only needed to be told one minute before arrival at the
                    Vatican so he could comb his hair. And that I did. When we got out of the car, I
                    tried to mend fences as best I could and introduced the Vatican Chief of
                    Protocol to the President. I had earlier suggested that if he did meet the
                    Cardinal, the President might wish to express his regrets that he hadn't been
                    able to see the Cardinal on the previous day. Kennedy's reply was that he would
                    leave regrets to the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>I should also mention that in that ride to the Vatican, Dean Rusk raised the
                    issue of Vatican recognition, saying that he felt the time had come for the
                    United States to recognize the Vatican. He thought that the domestic political
                    objections would be minor. Kennedy disagreed, noting that Harry Truman, a
                    Baptist, could not obtain agreement to recognition and that he, Kennedy, as the
                    first Catholic President, wouldn't have a chance of succeeding.</p>
                <p>That caravan going to the Vatican must have been a spectacle. There must have
                    twenty cars and trucks. It was, of course, a big deal since Kennedy had been the
                    first President to call on the Pope. The meeting with the Pope was somewhat
                    smaller than the audience, but included, as best I can remember, was Arthur
                    Schlesinger, John Roche, Sorensen, O'Donnell—all of the White House staff—and
                    Dean Rusk and the Charge, Frances Williamson (the Ambassador was ill and was in
                    the military hospital in Wiesbaden). But the conversations were just between the
                    President and the Pope. I was not present during that meeting.</p>
                <p>We did have a small incident on our way to the Vatican. One man broke through the
                    ranks of the police keeping the people on the sidewalks and ran to the limousine
                    and threw an envelope into it. There was a note in it, asking the President for
                    some favor or another. The Secret Service were horrified, as you can imagine.
                    The crowd was fair-sized. Kennedy was extraordinarily popular in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earlier, you mentioned that at the beginning of your tour
                        in Rome, you received a poor efficiency rating. Tell us a little about that
                        and what consequences it had on your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Bill Fraleigh was the Political Counselor, as I mentioned earlier. We
                    never had any public arguments or disagreements, but I always had the feeling
                    that he was irritated that only I and the Ambassador were privy to US
                    communications with the Vatican and to any reporting on the Holy See. He was cut
                    out of work that one of his subordinates was doing and that didn't make him very
                    happy. Also as time went on, my political reporting on the DC were sent to
                    Washington in preference to his commentaries. Being in competition with one's
                    boss is not anything that I would choose to do, but on several occasions I would
                    be directed by the DCM to write a report in a political event, only to find out
                    later that Fraleigh had done the same thing. In most instances, the DCM would
                    choose my draft. The DCM had a high regard for my work, which pleased me, but
                    made my relationships with the Political Counselor even more tenuous. Before the
                    end of my first two years in Rome, the DCM died during an emergency
                    operation.</p>
                <p>When it came to efficiency report time, I found myself facing a very negative
                    report. I was supposed to have been a procrastinator; that is, I had not been
                    responsive to his requests for reports. I must admit that it did happen on one
                    occasion because I thought his request had been unreasonable and a waste of
                    time. He had asked for a report on the election of the Mayor of Rome; that was
                    not an “event” in Italian politics and had no consequences whatsoever beyond the
                    Rome municipality. It would have been of zero interest to Washington and I was
                    busy on other matters at the time. The whole tone of the efficiency report was
                    harsh, which was very unusual for the times because in those days, efficiency
                    reports were written in subtle and delicate tones so that you had to read
                    between the lines and understand the code words if you really wanted to find out
                    what a supervisor thought of a particular employee. I was accused of cutting him
                    out of information, didn't invite him to representational functions and all
                    sorts of other slights and criticisms. I thought it was a most unfair and biased
                    report. For example, I really didn't host any representational events because my
                    contacts with the DC leadership was primarily during office hours. I may have
                    had an occasional cup of coffee late at night at the Piazza Navona, but the
                    Christian Democrats would seldom come to dinner at our house because they really
                    didn't feel obliged to socialize with Americans. They were the party in power
                    and didn't have to find occasions to make contacts with the Embassy, as, for
                    example, the Socialists did. Pietro Nenni, the Socialist leader, would be
                    delighted to accept a dinner invitation from one of my colleagues; he had to be
                    “on the make” and all the Socialists were delighted to have contacts with the
                    American Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>So his terrible efficiency report was written by Bill Fraleigh. We had an
                    Inspection Team in Rome at that time. In those days, Inspectors spent
                    considerable amount of time talking to each officer and staff employee, making
                    personal evaluations of all staff members. One of the Inspectors spent
                    considerable amount of time with me probing about my relationships with
                    Fraleigh. He had seen the report; I had not. From my responses, he pieced
                    together the real situation and wrote a separate efficiency report that
                    challenged all the criticisms that Fraleigh had made. The Inspector not only
                    challenged Fraleigh's assertions, but indicated that they were just plain wrong
                    and that they stemmed from a situation over which I had no control and for which
                    I should not be held responsible. That Inspector's intervention negated
                    Fraleigh's report and negated any adverse effect his report might have had on my
                    career. Furthermore, when the Ambassador heard from the Inspection team what
                    they had found, he also became involved and he took the opportunity to write a
                    separate note, noting how satisfied he was with my work on Vatican matters since
                    I had taken him to see the Pope, although I did not attend the private meeting
                    he had with His Holiness Paul VI. When the two of them came out of the Pope's
                    office, the Ambassador started to introduce me. The Pope said that that was not
                    necessary since he and his staff knew me very well and that the Vatican had
                    always found me very helpful. The Ambassador reported that incident in his
                    comments on my work and that was also very helpful. hatchet job</p>
                <p>The only other time that I found the efficiency rating used as a weapon was in
                    the days when they weren't available to the rated officer at all. They were
                    never shown to an employee, even when you came home to Washington for
                    consultation or assignment. Someone in Personnel would give you an oral thumb
                    nail description of what the ratings said, but you were not permitted to read
                    them yourself. This happened to me after my first our in Yokohama. I barely knew
                    what an efficiency rating was. My rating had been written by the Executive
                    Officer of the Consulate General. I don't know what that person had against me
                    except that I was assigned to live in a house that he wanted to have himself. I
                    couldn't think of any other reasons why my efficiency rating was so full of
                    venomous comments. I was accused of not knowing much about my work and not doing
                    it well. In fact, when efficiency reports finally were made available to
                    employees, my counselor in Personnel noted that such a report would not have
                    been acceptable under the new standards and would have been returned to the
                    drafting officer for rewrite. It was just overly biased and prejudicial without
                    any supporting evidence. I suspect that that efficiency report did have an
                    impact on my promotional opportunities because most of the people who entered
                    the Foreign Service at the same time as I did received their first promotion
                    much sooner than I did.</p>
                <p>In neither situation, did I write a rebuttal. In the fist place, in those days
                    they were not permitted. Furthermore, I have never seen a circumstance in which
                    rebuttals have had any beneficial effect on promotion or assignment panels; on
                    the contrary, it has been my experience that rebuttals tended to aggravate an
                    officer's standing rather than aid it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Kennedy visit have any consequences for US policy
                        towards the Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Most of the possible consequences were already on track by the time of
                    the visit. Relations were no longer as remote and as glacial as they had been
                    when Pius XII was the Pope. The separateness of the Vatican as a secular state,
                    which Pius XII had guarded so jealously, was beginning to crumble. Although
                    important American people, officials as well as private, were always received by
                    all Popes, from John XXIII on, no Pope had any particular difficulty having
                    Embassy staff come to the Vatican to discuss matters of mutual interest with
                    members of his staff. The Kennedy administration was quite circumspect about its
                    relations with the Vatican, concerned that it be criticized for being too close,
                    for obvious reasons. But it was anxious to maintain a dialogue with the Vatican.
                    Major efforts were made by both sides to stress the parallelism of policy
                    between Pope John XXIII, with his opening to the world and trying to modernize
                    the Church, and President Kennedy and his “New Frontier”. These parallel trends
                    were already underway when Kennedy visited, but his call on Pope Paul VI
                    highlighted the two policy tracks. It was the symbolism of the presentation made
                    by the Cardinal Secretary of State who, after the meeting with the Pope, in a
                    separate ceremony at the North American College gave Kennedy the gifts that he
                    would have received had John XXIII still been alive. One of those gifts was a
                    signed copy of the Pacem in Terris, the encyclical which was the highlight of
                    John XXIII's papacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that President Kennedy's assassination and
                        funeral caused quite a stir in Rome. Can you describe that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It was a fascinating period, which were particularly interesting to me
                    because of my job as liaison to the Vatican. As I mentioned, Kennedy's
                    popularity in Italy was extraordinary. The Italians are usually pretty blas�
                    about political leaders—their own as well as foreign. But the crowds who
                    witnessed Kennedy's visit were enormous. When he was assassinated, the Italians
                    took it as a personal tragedy. The taxi cab drivers, most of whom belonged to
                    the Communist Party, parked a cab in front of the Chancery, decorated with a
                    large funeral wreath, as a symbol of their sorrow. People stood in line for
                    hours waiting to come into the Chancery to sign the condolence book. Every
                    senior Italian official came to pay condolences.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>It was the general custom that when a head of state dies, the Italian government
                    would sponsor a memorial service usually at Santa Maria Degli Angeli—the little
                    Michelangelo church near the Termini railroad station. It became quickly clear
                    to me that that church could not possibly hold the crowd that wanted to attend,
                    both Italian and American.During this period, the Ecumenical Council was holding
                    one of its sessions. That added to the throng that wanted to pay its respects.
                    So I called the Vatican to inquire whether it would be possible to use one of
                    the major basilicas for the service. The Vatican volunteered Saint John Lateran,
                    which was the Pope's church in his capacity as Bishop of Rome. It was a big
                    church that could accommodate a large crowd. When I mentioned the new site to
                    the Italian government people, there was some rumbling because the bureaucracy
                    was concerned about the precedent. I pointed out that Michelangelo's church was
                    very small and that the crowd would be quite large. Finally, they and we went to
                    Saint John Lateran which like most Italian churches, had no installed seating,
                    but was very large. We discussed the necessity to rent some chairs, but were
                    told that the Vatican had an office, the Floreria Apostolica, which handled such
                    problems. It would bring the chairs and drape the church and whatever else had
                    to be done to make it suitable for a funeral ceremony. We then realized that the
                    main altar was at the end of the nave, far removed and not visible by anyone
                    standing in the second half of the church. But there was a second altar, which
                    stood at the center of the transept. That was the Papal altar which was reserved
                    for the exclusive use of the Pontiff. I asked whether it would be possible for
                    that altar to be used for the Kennedy's ceremonies. That furrowed many brows. My
                    friend, Monsignor Cardinale, said that he thought it might be possible to issue
                    a Papal Bull, which was required if the papal altar was to be used. That Bull
                    would be posted so that all would know that the Pope had personally approved the
                    use of the altar. And that is what was done.</p>
                <p>We had been discussing the ceremony with the American Cardinals who were in Rome
                    for the Ecumenical Council. Cardinal Spellman was the senior American
                    ecclesiastical official. He was the one who would conduct the Mass. All the
                    American Cardinals were in Rome at the time, including Cushing, who as
                    Archbishop of Boston had, of course, a special relationship to the Kennedys. He
                    was chosen to deliver the homily. The rest of the cast was to include members of
                    the North American College and Monsignor Dante, the great liturgy expert, who
                    had taught all the Cardinals when they were students at the College and who
                    tended to treat them as if they were still his students. The Vatican's protocol
                    people were there to make sure that everybody dressed and behaved appropriately.
                    A Mass of this kind can get very complicated and it really required considerable
                    expertise to make sure that all went according to script.</p>
                <p>In any case, the preparations for the ceremony required me to be in frequent
                    contact with Cardinal Spellman. At sometime during this period, I got a call
                    from the Cardinal who expressed great surprise that the Pope had released the
                    use of the altar to him. He sounded almost overwhelmed. I expressed great
                    surprise and congratulated him on his honor. He did not know nor did I ever tell
                    him that the arrangements had been worked out between the Vatican and some
                    functionary at the American Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The Embassy staff had been working around the clock, putting black borders on all
                    the Embassy's envelopes with magic markers, getting the condolence books ready
                    (we must have gone through 9 or 10 books, each of which held 10,000 signatures)
                    and doing all the other myriad of tasks that take place when a President dies.
                    We had a huge set of regulations—the Combined Federal Regulations—that governed
                    our practices; I think that probably has been changed by now.</p>
                <p>But in any case, the ceremonies went off very smoothly. In attendance at the Mass
                    must have been at least 300 Cardinals. They of course were the “Big Wigs” and
                    sat wherever they wished. The Floreria kept bringing more and more chairs. The
                    whole church was people packed in like sardines from wall to wall. It was
                    incredible; I had never seen a crowd like that in a church in Italy.</p>
                <p>In addition to making the basilica available for the ceremony, the Vatican sent
                    official condolences. I should note that I was never fully apprized of the
                    “back-channel” communications that took place between the Vatican and the White
                    House. Pierre Salinger certainly was involved and perhaps even the principal
                    connection. I was aware that such communications did take place, but was never
                    fully cognizant of their contents. I used to hear rumors or get small hints by
                    Monsignor Cardinale, who was the Vatican representative in the
                    communications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After five years in Rome, you were assigned to Washington
                        in 1965. How was that assignment made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: At one point in time, I had expressed an interest in doing personnel
                    work. The then Executive Director of EUR wanted me to work on his staff as the
                    personnel officer. The decentralization of the personnel work, as directed by
                    Bill Crockett, had not yet taken place. That directive which came along later in
                    1965, just before I returned to Washington, took much of the personnel
                    responsibility out of the central Personnel office and assigned it to the
                    operating Bureaus. By the time I actually returned, Fred Irving had taken over
                    as Executive Director of EUR and he decided that he wanted someone else in that
                    personnel job—Vic Dikeos. So I was assigned to the personnel job in the East
                    Asia Bureau instead, replacing Cleo Noel. I worked for Marshall Jones, who was
                    the Executive Director of EA and Orson Trueworthy, his deputy. Since the
                    Crockett new management approach had been put in effect, we were all dealing
                    with a new situation in the personnel field. There were still little pieces of
                    the old system hanging on here and there, but the core decentralization of the
                    assignment process had been put in place.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>It was my first tour in the personnel function. Everyone always wants to know how
                    it works and frankly, I was amazed that it worked at all, given the enormous
                    problems that the Department's personnel system had. I liked my job, even though
                    it was a very turbulent period created by Crockett's new approach. There was a
                    lot of concern and irritation about the Bureaus taking greater control. Those
                    who were satisfied with the old system, groused of course and predicted
                    catastrophes. On retrospective reflection, I think it was a wise move and it
                    worked satisfactorily. Personnel responsibilities should be on those who have to
                    live with the consequences of their actions. When the assignment responsibility
                    lay with the central Personnel Office, it did not have to live with the
                    consequences of its actions; the good and the bad was left to the Bureaus,
                    particularly the Regional ones.</p>
                <p>I headed the personnel shop for the Bureau. I had three or four people working
                    for me. Our main responsibility was to see that people in EA had onward
                    assignments and that EA would get those officers it was interested in. As I
                    said, I think that the personnel system worked better with the assignment
                    responsibility delegated to the Bureaus primarily because those Bureaus were
                    much more familiar with the personnel requirements in the posts in their
                    geographic area. A central Personnel officer could not possibly be current on
                    post's needs; he or she was primarily interested in getting the people who
                    needed assignments placed in some position. As long as the “unassigned” list was
                    small, the personnel officer had accomplished his or her duties. It is true, I
                    believe, that a personnel officer in the Personnel Office may have had greater
                    concern for an employee's career, but that knowledge was not enough to
                    compensate for the priority importance of staffing a post so that it could
                    operate at maximum efficiency. That goal required both an intimate knowledge of
                    the jobs at a post, but also the personalities of the existing staff and the
                    likely effect that a newcomer would have on effectiveness of the post. Such
                    concerns were of little interest to an officer in a central personnel office;
                    the “good of the Service” was of secondary importance to the career development
                    of an employee and the need to reduce the list of “unassigned”. The difficult
                    assignments were worked out much more easily by a Bureau than a personnel
                    counselor in a central personnel office.</p>
                <p>The Crockett system did not give the Bureaus a carte blanche. The Bureaus still
                    had to clear all assignments with the career counselors in the central office.
                    The process centered on an “assignment panel” system, which met every Tuesday—it
                    was called the “slave market”—and hammered out compromises in those cases where
                    a Bureau's goals were found to be not in the individual officer's career
                    development interests. In the central Personnel Office, we found some good
                    career counselors and some who were not so good. Some were inventive and
                    persuasive in making their pitch; some were total failures in making their case.
                    As result, some individuals were more appropriately assigned than others. But by
                    and large, the system did work. Each Bureau got a fair share of the “stars” and
                    every Bureau got its share of “turkeys”. No Bureau or officer was shortchanged
                    in the main.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the criticisms that has been often made of the
                        Department's personnel system was and is that very few professional
                        personnel experts are involved. Do you have any reaction to that
                        charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I feel the same way about personnel people the same way I feel about any
                    experts, who come to a situation from far away, knowing little about local
                    circumstances. A professional personnel officer is just someone who has spent
                    more than a year in the field. I felt that I was just as much of a professional
                    after two months on the job as one any else. I don't think that it requires some
                    arcane training to be a personnel officer. An exception I would make to that
                    rule is for the people who handle questions of benefits, retirement,
                    classification, etc. Those jobs do require considerable background and knowledge
                    of complex laws and regulations. But the assignment function, which consists
                    essentially of putting the right person in the right job, can be done by any
                    sensible person with experience in the work of the Department of State.</p>

                <p>SHERMAN: AFSA was a factor, but not a major one yet. The “revolution” had not yet
                    begun, although the Junior Foreign Service Officer Association was very active.

                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I had been back from Rome for about five months when John Rooney (D, NY
                    and the Chairman of the budget subcommittee which handled the State Department
                    budget) was making his annual trip abroad after the Congress had gone into end
                    of the year recess.. That was always a crunch point for Bill Crockett, who, as
                    Deputy Under Secretary for Administration, was responsible for the care and
                    feeding of Congressman John Rooney, the Chairman of the House's Subcommittee on
                    Appropriations for the State and Justice Departments. These annual trips went
                    wherever Rooney felt like going that year. He was always accompanied by the
                    chief of staff of the Subcommittee, Jay Howe, Mitch Cieplinski, an old cohort
                    from Brooklyn, Ray Farrell, the Commissioner of INS and his wife and others.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>In 1965, this crowd was to sail to Italy and then go on to Israel, and then to
                    France. When Crockett reviewed the staffing of the Embassy in Rome, he found
                    that Fred Reinhardt, the Ambassador was in Washington for selection boards, that
                    Frank Meloy, the DCM, was accompanying Mike Mansfield through Southeast Asia,
                    and that Ralph Ribble, the Administrative Counselor, was also in Washington
                    serving on the selection boards. Crockett did not feel that he could take Rooney
                    to a post so badly denuded in its leadership. There wouldn't be anyone in Rome
                    who could support a Rooney visit. So he decided to take Reinhardt and Ribble off
                    the selections boards and sent them back to Rome. That would have done terrible
                    violence to the promotion system. Reinhardt went to Crockett to protest and
                    suggested that Sherman be recruited to go to Rome to help with the support of
                    the delegation. The Ambassador pointed out that I had had considerable
                    experience with Congressional visits and that I knew Italy and Rome especially
                    very well. I also spoke Italian fluently. He also pointed out that I had good
                    connections in the Vatican which would be helpful in getting Rooney to see the
                    Pope, which was a must. Bill finally agreed to do what Reinhardt suggested,
                    partly because the ship was sailing the next day. I had only met Crockett
                    briefly the one time when he had come through Rome with LBJ.</p>
                <p>So I was instructed to get on a plane and go to Italy and be available to meet
                    the ship when it anchored in Naples. I was to stay with the delegation from then
                    on. We spent a week in Naples and then a few days in Palermo and then to Rome
                    for another ten days. I was instructed not tell anybody why I was in Italy;
                    Crockett didn't want any word being spread that the Department was doing
                    anything special for Rooney! If anyone asked, I was to say that I was going to
                    Italy only to facilitate that part of Rooney's trip. So I flew to Naples and met
                    the ship.</p>
                <p>I was introduced to Rooney as an officer from the Embassy who had been assigned
                    to assist the delegation. I don't know whether he knew that I was Washington
                    based, but I suspect that Crockett may have told him. Then the trip began.
                    Somehow it seemed to go well. Rooney's son, Skippy, was living in Rome. He and
                    his father had been somewhat estranged because the son had married a woman that
                    hadn't pleased the parents. She was not a Catholic and that was a problem.
                    Skippy joined the group and we became friends. Rooney was pleased by that turn
                    of events and that helped. In those days, I was still able to stay up all night
                    drinking with the Chairman and still be able to get up the following morning in
                    time to rearrange that day's schedule in accordance with the Chairman's
                    whims.</p>
                <p>From Naples, we went to Palermo and repeated the same process there just with a
                    different scenery and different characters. But the daily process was the same.
                    After Palermo, we visited Rome for a week. The main focus of that stop was to
                    get Rooney an audience with the Pope and with Cardinale Wsyinsky, who was
                    important to Rooney because of Rooney's Polish constituents. I did arrange those
                    meetings. The schedule then called for Rooney's group to go to Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Crockett's original understanding with Reinhardt was that I would leave to group
                    after it left Italy because my principal raison d'etre was to translate and make
                    all the necessary arrangements in Italy. So I expected to return to Washington
                    after Rome. But Rooney insisted that I stay with the group for the whole trip.
                    So I went to Israel for a week which has been my only trip to the Middle East.
                    We covered Israel from one end to the other, by car and plane. I just became
                    part of the traveling show; I made the martinis and carried the cigarettes, but
                    I also had plenty of time to enjoy the sight-seeing. Then I went with the group
                    from Israel to Paris and had three or four days there. Then it came time for
                    Rooney to catch a ship to return to the United States. He wanted me to come back
                    with him on the ship, but I would not have landed until after Christmas and I
                    was anxious to get back to my family. So I firmly, but very politely, asked to
                    be excused from the ship ride and Rooney finally relented. But I must say, that
                    he was very warm when we separated. He had during the trip repaired his
                    relations with his son, Skippy, who had gone through Italy, Israel and Paris
                    with us—that had not been the original plan, but since the father and son had
                    reconciled, the US government paid for both of their transportation and
                    accommodations. At the Hotel George V, he wrung my hand and thanked me profusely
                    for all that I had done. He felt that I had been very helpful to his son.
                    Actually, all I had done was to describe what Foreign Service life was like, but
                    I guess Skippy was happy that he had someone to talk to and let his views be
                    known to his father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this trip fit in, if at all, with your assignment
                        to Crockett's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: One early morning, about 3 a.m, during the Rooney trip, Rooney had gone
                    to bed and Bill Crockett and I were just chatting. At some stage of that
                    conversation, Crockett said: “You don't seem like a Foreign Service officer”. I
                    responded with some heat that I was a true-blue; that I entered through a very
                    stiff competition and that I was five degree Brahmin—I had taken a three day
                    exam unlike the then recruits that were taking only a one day exam. I had even
                    passed through the old Board of Examiners, headed by Joe Green, who was
                    everybody's nightmare. Bill then went on to say that he needed to have someone
                    like me in his office; John DeWitt was leaving and he wondered whether I would
                    consider replacing him. I accepted on the spot, without hesitation, because I
                    was interested in what he was doing and because on that trip, I had become
                    attracted by Bill's vision of how his job was to be done and by how he handled
                    himself both with Rooney, the rest of the group and people like myself. I had,
                    of course, heard many negative comments about the way Crockett handled Rooney.
                    Some of my colleagues resented the treatment that Rooney—a mean, old, drunken
                    Irishman, was receiving from Crockett and the Department. On the trip, Bill made
                    it clear to me that he didn't like it any better than the critics did. On the
                    other hand, he understood, as other did not, that keeping Rooney appeased and
                    knowledgeable made him a very effective advocate for the Department in
                    Congressional battles, particularly on budget issues. Once his requirements had
                    been met, and once Jay Howe, his close assistant, had filed them in his
                    remarkable mind, the Department did not have any further problem with Rooney. He
                    would fight any attempts to cut “his” budget; he looked upon it as his personal
                    fiefdom and wasn't about to let anyone else impinge on his territory. He exacted
                    his own tribute and penance from his parishioners, but once he had arrived at
                    the what he considered the appropriate stage, he would defend his
                    recommendations to the bitter end. Bill thought that what Rooney demanded out of
                    the Department was a small price to pay, even though he personally had to carry
                    a very heavy burden. Those were the days when committee chairmen were kings and
                    unchallenged by any younger knights. Rooney certainly got away with murder as
                    did Wayne Hayes for example.</p>
                <p>I had of course heard the name “Crockett” long before I met him. He was well
                    known throughout the Service. He had left Rome many years before my assignment
                    there. I had heard all the comments from those people who thought that Bill was
                    “out to wreck the Service”. That reputation did not deter me one iota from
                    joining his staff. As a matter of fact, once I had gotten into the job, Bill did
                    get some good feed-back about my reputation in the Service, which, I suspect, he
                    had not known very well when he offered me the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The relationships between Crockett and the Secretary and the Under Secretary were
                    not close. Most of the dealings between the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary
                    for Administration (known as “O”) and the Under Secretary's office were
                    conducted through George Ball's special assistant, George Springsteen. Ed Adams
                    was Crockett's special assistant who used to have to negotiate with George. One
                    day, Ed came into the office very pale; he had just finished being subjected to
                    one of Springsteen's frequent temper flares. He said that he just wouldn't do
                    that anymore; it was demeaning and too painful. So Crockett turned to me and
                    asked me to take on the chore of relating to George Springsteen. I got my
                    baptism of fire soon thereafter. One of our secretaries decided, without
                    consultations with any one else, to revise the Department's parking pass
                    allocations list. There were people on the list who really did not have a
                    justification for this perk, but it was not a subject to be trifled with. Before
                    I knew anything about, I got a call from Springsteen who said: “it has come to
                    the Under Secretary's attention that Miss......has been asked to return her
                    parking pass”. I said I thought I could take care of that problem and hung up.
                    We reinstated the pass immediately. From than on, George used to come to me
                    periodically and I never had any trouble with him. He never shouted at me once.
                    That was true of other Seventh Floor denizens like Ben Read, who was then the
                    Executive Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was “O” organized when you got there in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Bill's basic management program—”Management by Objectives”—had already
                    been institutionalized. So there were about fifty program managers reporting to
                    him. In his immediate office, Bill had Roy Little, who handled the Confidential
                    Funds; Mich Cieplinski, whose role was essentially the tending and feeding of
                    John Rooney; Bill Trone, to coordinate the Department's administrative general
                    services operations; Ralph Roberts to coordinate budget and fiscal matters.
                    These latter three had some official titles like Deputy Assistant Secretaries,
                    but in fact, coordinated the program managers that fell in their category. Ed
                    Adams and I were the two special assistants, assisted by a more junior officer.
                    Ed did the personnel work. Bill handled the liaison with the White House because
                    of his close relationship to Lyndon Johnson. Betty Donovan was Bill's
                    “gate-keeper”. Much of the secretarial work was done by Margaret Bowman; she was
                    the one who would come in early when Bill would dictate from the notes he made
                    on a yellow pad during the night sitting next to his furnace.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I also got involved in personnel work, but my main task was to monitor Bill's
                    meetings to make sure that whatever decisions were reached would be transmitted
                    to the appropriate program manager and implemented. At the beginning, I think Ed
                    may have been concerned by this process because it might have impinged on his
                    responsibilities, but I quickly assured him that that was not going to happen
                    and that I would pass on to him anything about personnel matters that may have
                    arisen during these meetings. Sometimes, Bill would rase his hand when he
                    ushered his visitor into his office. That was the signal to me that he wanted to
                    have a private meeting, but that didn't happen very often. Much of the workload
                    was created by Ambassadors who wanted some favor, like a “water storage”
                    facility (commonly known as a swimming pool). If Bill would agree to proceed,
                    then I would ask the action office to move ahead. I also attended all of Bill's
                    meetings with his program managers. At least once a year, they would have a
                    session to evaluate their past year's performance and establish targets and
                    actions to be taken during the following year. Bill would approve those goals
                    and objectives that he felt were appropriate and they became the manager's
                    marching orders for the following period of time.</p>
                <p>Dick Barrett, who was one of Bill's program managers, would have periodic
                    meetings, often with another new idea or two. Sometimes, we would have an
                    impromptu “T-group” session. Katie Louchheim would talk to Bill about women's
                    issues. She also did a lot of political work since she had been one of the
                    senior officials of the Democratic party.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Bill's management style was new to me. I hadn't been really involved in any
                    management effort. So I was sort of wide-eyed. I read “The Human Side of
                    Management” which was the godfather of the “Theory X, Theory Y” concept. I
                    listened to Dick Barrett's passionate expositions on the subject. I did have a
                    wondering reaction when I looked at “O”'s organization chart. There were so many
                    people reporting to one individual. But Bill handled it all so smoothly that the
                    span-of-control theories were completely disregarded without any dire
                    consequences. Of course, I have never encountered anyone like Bill Crockett in
                    his ability to juggle so many balls at one time without seeming overwhelmed and
                    without being immobilized in making decisions. He had an uncanny ability of
                    being able to determine his own priorities. As I said, I had never been a
                    program manager; like most younger Foreign Service Officers, I had never
                    supervised more than one half of a secretary. While in “O”, the NSC issued a new
                    NSSM which established the Country Director system which was intended to make
                    the State Department's Country Director the linchpin in the US Government on all
                    matters relating to activities in his or her country of responsibility. That
                    concept required all the Regional Bureaus to abolish a number of Deputy
                    assistant Secretary positions to eliminate the layer between the Assistant
                    secretary and the Country Directors. We laboriously negotiated with every
                    Assistant Secretary not only to abolish these positions, but to reorganize their
                    Bureaus so that almost every country had a Country Director and so that regional
                    Offices were abolished. I became deeply involved in this reorganization effort.
                    I also became involved in developing seminars for Country Directors so that they
                    would have a better understanding of the significance of the NSSM and the
                    opportunities that the new scheme gave them to improve their management of all
                    U.S. efforts in their countries. Some of the new Directors responded by taking a
                    leadership role; others just went on as before. For example, Dick Sneider
                    grabbed the ball and ran with it ; he really became the country director for
                    Japan ; so did Dean Brown for France; many others did not. I thought many missed
                    great opportunities; power was raining on them, but half took out their
                    umbrellas and half collected the rain in buckets. So the program did not become
                    totally successful simply because some were reluctant to exercise the power
                    granted them and because other power centers, like the Pentagon, would not
                    surrender what they believed to be their holy rights. The new system required
                    more management ability and more chutzpah than many Foreign Service Officers
                    were able to produce.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of activity in “O” at the time relating to the “Hayes bill”. Bill
                    was trying to have the Foreign Service Act amended to provide greater
                    flexibility for its administration and to provide greater applicability of it to
                    other government agencies involved in foreign affairs. The Foreign Service was
                    showing great resistance, led by Sam Berger, the chairman of the Department's
                    Committee on Professional Standards. It was known in the Department as the
                    “Berger Committee” and had about forty members. The most active members were
                    Bill Knight and Freddie Chapin, who did most of the Committee's drafting and
                    were in the forefront of the discussion. The Committee was established in some
                    respects as a counter-weight to Crockett because Berger felt, and often stated,
                    that the business of the Foreign Service was not “management”; it was
                    “diplomacy”.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Sam was a friend who had in fact brought me up from Yokohama to work in the
                    Embassy in Tokyo some years earlier. He asked me to join the Committee. I asked
                    him whether he knew that I was working for Bill Crockett. He said he knew, but
                    did not consider that a problem. So I did attend most of the meetings and I
                    think I did manage to keep my credibility in both camps, without violating my
                    personal integrity. I presented “O”'s views on many issues, not always
                    successfully. Berger later on testified before Congress an the status of the
                    Foreign Service making many of the same comments he had made to his Committee.
                    In describing his activities as an Ambassador, I remembered he said that he met
                    with his Political Counselor every day, he met with Economic Counselor every
                    day, he met with his DCM every day and then he met with his Administrative man
                    once a week—maybe. The point that I tried to bring before the Committee, and it
                    was one that Crockett often made, was that every substantive decision an
                    Ambassador or an Assistant Secretary made almost always requires resources:
                    money or people or things and sometimes two or all three. So unless the
                    administrative staff is prepared to support the substantive decision and knows
                    what the objective is, the decision maker will not succeed. Policies are not
                    implemented in a vacuum; more often than not, they need tangible resources to
                    succeed. They cost money and man-hours. I must admit that this argument never
                    was accepted by the Committee. There are tomes written by or about Foreign
                    Service “ambassadorial greats” like Ellis Briggs or others who will say that
                    they managed their posts with only a handful of people. We know that that wasn't
                    true. That handful represented only the people the ambassador saw. There were
                    many more “worker bees” who actually got things done and made the ambassador
                    successful. We forget quickly that it takes a driver and a motor-pool to make
                    sure that the ambassador has a car available when he wants to deliver a demarche
                    to the Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>I must say that I never felt any resentment from my Foreign Service friends for
                    working in “O”. No one ever called me “traitor” and no one ever tried to use me
                    to get some changes made in rules and regulations or for any favors. I was
                    always very candid with everybody about what I was involved in. I often found
                    myself as an advocate for Crockett and many of his programs. I used to say to my
                    friends that they were shooting at the wrong target. Bill Crockett, I felt, had
                    done more for the Foreign Service that any of his predecessors. He brought many
                    benefits to the Foreign Service, like emergency leave, educational and hardship
                    allowances, a responsive medical system that tried to take care of personnel at
                    hardship posts, etc. He was very good for the Foreign Service. Whatever
                    personnel problems individual people may have encountered were largely the fault
                    of the Office of Personnel, not Bill Crockett's. These were not systemic
                    problems, but the usual and eternal problems that any individual may encounter
                    in any institution.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>On a different note, I should make some comments about the “T-groups” that were
                    till very much alive at this time. Crockett used as one of his consultants,
                    Alfred Merrill, the author of “The Man behind the Mask”. That was the basic
                    reader on “T- groups” and their utility as management tools to change an
                    institution's culture. Merrill came to talk to us and after that Crockett
                    decided to vigorously pursue the ACCORD program, headed by Dick Barrett and Jack
                    Haar. It was an interesting approach which was new to me. I flew to Chicago to
                    attend a three day seminar sponsored by the National Association of Management.
                    The subject was the use of behavioral sciences in management. I heard some
                    excellent lectures which piqued my interest and led me to support the program.
                    We started by taking large chunks of the Department—office directors and
                    above—to the Tidewater Inn in Easton, MD. on the Eastern Shore. We took them in
                    small groups—five to ten. They spent five days together in a room with a
                    trainer, usually a psychologist, who had experience with these techniques. These
                    people would talk in an unstructured way. In doing so, people reacted in
                    different ways. Some took a leadership position and tried to dictate an agenda.
                    The trainer would then interrupt and point out that the issues were all about
                    present problems. The discussions were to focus on matters of longer duration so
                    that the participants could begin to plummet their own motivations, their own
                    psyches, including all the insecurities and deficiencies that we all suffer.
                    Eventually, the objective was to have a group organize itself and become a well
                    functioning organism, having grasped a deeper understanding of themselves and
                    others.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The genesis for this approach was the findings of many, including the
                    psychologist and management expert ,Chris Argyris, that the Foreign Service
                    consisted of a lot of very smart individuals who however, because of their
                    individual personalities, had a difficult time working together. They tended to
                    work alone and in many cases withheld vital information from their colleagues in
                    misguided attempts to compete and control. I think, in general, that was a fair
                    criticism. The group sessions had mixed results. In the first place, the effort
                    was a new approach for the Foreign Service and that is difficult to swallow in
                    any circumstances. For example, George Allen, then the Director of the FSI—a
                    distinguished senior diplomat—went to the Inn and left in outrage after the
                    first day, painting the whole experiment as “brain-washing”. The trainers did
                    not seem very concerned by these failures, even though I thought such well known
                    defections by highly respected senior officers were a set-back to the process.
                    They did not understand the Department of the Foreign Service and the impact
                    that an Allen would have on many others. Argyris was the senior trainer who had
                    to cope with these problems. Unfortunately, the only access he had to the
                    Department was through the “O” area. He and his fellow trainers began to believe
                    that the Department's best people were in the “O” area because we were the only
                    ones that seemed open to trying new techniques. As far as the trainers were
                    concerned, the rest of the Department was staffed with hide-bound, stuffed
                    shirts who were impossible to deal with and could never be changed. They used
                    their very simplistic analysis as descriptive. They would ask someone: “Are you
                    an “O” person or someone from other parts of the Department?”. It was a poor
                    approach because it made the ACCORD program that much more controversial and
                    that much more likely to fail. Some other aspects of their performance left much
                    to be desired. They sometimes would bring a tray of lemons to the conference
                    room. Everyone was to pick his or her lemon by just pointing at a particular
                    slice. But the participant was to view the lemon closely enough so that he or
                    she could distinguish it from other lemons. It was an effort to teach that
                    although things may seem very much alike, they are, in fact, not so and have
                    individual characteristics which distinguish one from another. You could easily
                    see how that exercise might have an unfortunate impact because all the
                    participants thought that they had important matters waiting for them back in
                    their offices and would be resentful of spending a week picking out one lemon
                    from many others. That approach was in addition to the resistance that most of
                    the participants brought with them in any case. I must say that some of the
                    groups were successful in bringing the participants around to viewing their
                    setting with fresh eyes; in other cases, the “T-group” was a dismal failure. I
                    think, overall, that the ACCORD program cost a lot of money; it made a few
                    converts, who subsequently would tell their subordinates: “You are saying such
                    and such, but I hear that you are really thinking such and such”. So a few
                    management-human relations problems may have been solved, but by and large, the
                    experiment was a failure which was too bad because it was not intended to be a
                    “brain-washing” experience, but one that would bring greater cohesiveness to the
                    Department and the Foreign Service. It was intended to change the culture of the
                    Department and the Foreign Service by trying to break down traditional patterns
                    were dysfunctional. I thought that the basic assumptions made to develop the
                    ACCORD program were sound; the execution was sloppy. I will not blame that on
                    Bill Crockett; he was spread too thin to be able to monitor the program
                    adequately. The personalities of the people who were pushing the program, the
                    over-sell of the program and the magnitude of their efforts all militated
                    against success. Had the sponsors started on a much smaller scale, concentrating
                    on a few key change agents, I would guess that in the end they would have been
                    more successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the programming system still alive at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It was. People were still producing the long reports. We took the
                    program over to the Bureau of the Budget. It did not get a very good reception
                    and it became apparent that it would not allow any funds for the continuation of
                    it. Bill Crockett, more or less, just sat at the conference table and permitted
                    BoB to take its step. That passivity really upset Barrett. He left the meeting,
                    like Achilles retreating to his tent. He just stalked back to his office and
                    closed the door. That afternoon, Chris Argyris told Bill that he had an unhappy
                    employee on his hands. So Bill asked Barrett to come to his office and held a
                    two-three hour “healing” session. Bill was at that point just bowing to
                    inevitability; he felt that BoB had long before made up its mind and that to
                    continue the battle was just a waste of time. In addition, Crockett recognized
                    that there was virtually no support for the project in the Department mainly
                    because the concept was not well understood, either by the consumers or the
                    analysts. For example, the word “promote” was used widely (e.g. promote certain
                    substantive goals). It was very difficult to allocate the time of an officer who
                    may have spent “promoting” a number of substantive goals; furthermore, the time
                    spent on each “promotion” was bound to be rather limited. It was also very
                    difficult to quantify negative objectives. How does an officer show how he spent
                    his time preventing the host country from taking some action or not taking any
                    action at all on some issue? It was conceptually a very difficult if not
                    impossible program. We assigned people to run the program in a number of
                    embassies; that was never very successful.</p>
                <p>I personally did not accept, in the mid-60s, the assumptions on which the
                    programming system was based. That is, I did not believe that you could to any
                    degree of utility, associate resources with foreign policy objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about Crockett's relationship to the
                        Foreign Service in the mid-60s period. From your observations, how were
                        those relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I thought they were improving, by and large. It seemed to me that when
                    he had an opportunity to discuss issues with various Foreign Service groups,
                    like the Junior Foreign Service Officers Association or AFSA or others, the
                    meetings were always congenial and afforded both sides an opportunity to raise
                    questions and debate issues. Bill was able to present his considerations that
                    led him to one decision or another with clarity and vigor. He was not himself a
                    controversial figure, by and large. His support of the Hayes bill was not
                    popular because it permitted the entry of new people into the Foreign service at
                    levels above the entry one. That violated one of the traditions of the Foreign
                    Service which brought people in at the bottom and then promoted them through the
                    ranks or selected them out if they did not meet the standards. That objection is
                    still being articulated today.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe Bill's relationship to Secretary
                        Rusk and Under Secretary Ball?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I always thought they could have been better. Bill was over-sensitive
                    about those relationships. He had an inferiority complex with respect to Rusk
                    and even more with George Ball. He never really made a full effort to defend his
                    programs and his organization. He relied more on the protection offered by his
                    relationship to Lyndon Johnson to achieve his objectives. I think he could have
                    made a greater effort to bring the Secretary and the Under Secretary to provide
                    him support, but he just wasn't comfortable with either and therefore didn't
                    pursue his case with them to any great extent.</p>
                <p>it is true that Rusk and Ball didn't get involved in management/administrative
                    issue very much. But, for example, on one occasion, while we were trying to
                    support a Presidential trip to Southeast Asia, Ben Read, then the Executive
                    Secretary called me in Manila and said that the Secretary was appalled by the
                    size of the support staff that we had assembled in the Philippines. Read said
                    that the Secretary wanted all of them to return to their regular duty stations
                    immediately. Rusk allegedly felt that all the necessary support could be
                    provided by the Embassy. Read said that Secretary knew that there were more
                    people in our Embassy in London than there were in the whole British Foreign
                    Office and that the US presence in Manila was just another manifestation of
                    gross over-staffing. I pointed out to Read that he must be referring to the
                    substantive people that were along with the President because the administrative
                    support team was there because it took a lot of people to meet the President's
                    needs or at least what we had been told were his needs. Reid said that it was
                    the administrative people particularly that had aroused Rusk's indignation and
                    he wanted them all returned to their duty stations immediately. He said it was
                    an irrevocable decision. So I told Bill about the call. He strolled down to the
                    Presidential quarters in the hotel and I never heard another word about the
                    subject. But it was clear that every time Bill had to seek Presidential or
                    Congressional support, he felt guilty about it. He didn't like to do it because
                    it made him feel as an “outsider”. The irony was that all of Bill's efforts,
                    whether it was support of Presidential or Congressional trips or any of his
                    programs, were directed to making the Department of State look better and work
                    more efficiently, but many of his actions were just not congenial to his
                    colleagues and were not seen as meeting the intended purposes.</p>

                <p>SHERMAN: Three were a lot of telephone calls from the President, mostly about
                    individuals that the President wanted to have hired. Johnson would even in many
                    cases specify the salary he wanted the individual to make. It was sometimes the
                    husband of one of his secretaries. Ed Adams, who had the responsibility for
                    following through, would find a position for the individual, but in a number of
                    cases, that would be the last the Department would see of him. People like John
                    Gonella were “phantom” employees. They in fact were White House employees on
                    State's payroll. They might have been Veterans Administration or INS employees.
                    Johnson knew exactly what they made and could therefore dictate a specific
                    salary. The transfer to State's rolls often involved a pay step increase or a
                    grade promotion. Johnson personally got involved in these cases. I remember
                    occasions when Bill would be away from his office—for example, addressing a
                    group in the auditorium or somewhere— when Johnson would call. I would take a
                    note to Bill that the President wanted to speak to him. Bill would excuse
                    himself, saying something like: “If I told you what was in this note, you
                    wouldn't believe it” and left for a few minutes to speak to the President.</p>

                <p>SHERMAN: I spent so much time on Presidential travels once Lyndon Johnson started
                    to travel that I didn't have much time for anything else. The first few months
                    were quiet because Johnson had to wait for Hubert Humphrey to be elected
                    Vice-President before he could really leave the country—there was of course no
                    Vice President after Kennedy's assassination. Almost immediately after
                    Humphrey's election, Johnson planned to attend a Chiefs of State meeting in
                    Manila—the so called “Manila Summit”. We had eleven days notice. The day after
                    the President made his decision to attend, I was on my way to Manila with Bill
                    Moyers on the advance team. Johnson decided also to go to Hawaii, New Zealand,
                    Australia—Canberra and Brisbane—, Thailand, Malaysia, Pago Pago before attending
                    the Summit. After finishing the advance, I returned to Washington only to join
                    the President's party as it left for Southeast Asia. It was the first of several
                    Presidential extravaganzas that I engaged in. Crockett had never done it with
                    Johnson as President; he had done it often when Johnson was Vice-President. But
                    this was a different ball game.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We improvised all along the line. I sat most of the time with a pad on my lap
                    writing cables back to Bill Trone asking for one thing or another, mostly
                    additional personnel like communicators, general services officers, etc. We
                    suggested who might be assigned to support the trip on a TDY basis. At each
                    post, we assigned a coordinator who had responsibility for all administrative
                    support. It was essential that we recruit additional personnel. I remember
                    arriving in Wellington and going to the Captain Cook Hotel, the only major one
                    in town. I asked whether they had room for the President of the United States
                    and his party. The woman at the desk said: “We can book him in May!”. Housing
                    was so scarce in Wellington that we recommissioned a couple of disused
                    North-South island ferry boats; we used them to accommodate the press. Idar
                    Rimestad was brought in from Paris to be the coordinator. It was an adventure
                    everywhere. One administrative type laid down on the tarmac in Wellington to
                    prevent a plane from leaving because we had to load something else on it.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Southeast Asia trip, Johnson went to Punta del Este for a Latin
                    American Chiefs of State meeting. I did the advance work on that one too for
                    about a week. I never got to Punta del Este for the actual visit because I was
                    diverted to Suriname in order to prepare for a refueling stop. The plan had been
                    to refuel in Guyana, but the runway was filled at one end by rubble which was
                    frequently ingested by the jet engines. That wouldn't do, so we took off from
                    Guyana not knowing exactly where we were going to find a refueling stop. While
                    we were in mid-air, Marvin Watson decided on Suriname, which was still a Dutch
                    colony. Bill Stinson and I and a few others were dropped off there and we put a
                    refueling stop together.</p>
                <p>Then there was a quick trip to Bonn to attend Adenauer's funeral. That was a
                    sudden one that couldn't be advanced very much. I also went with Hubert Humphrey
                    to the inauguration of Park Chung Hee, the President of South Korea. I did the
                    advance on that and then manned the control room. By that time, Bob Peck was
                    handling trips; Bill Crockett had left the Department and Rimestad had succeeded
                    him. Idar had gone to Germany with Johnson; that had been his baptism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Secretary have a valid complaint about the support
                        the Department provided Presidential trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: There were too many people on Presidential trips. We did “over-kill”. It
                    could have been done with fewer human resources, but our response time to
                    Presidential requests could not have been done as fast. The President might have
                    had to wait for a few minutes to get something done. There were hundreds of
                    people particularly for the Southeast Asia trip. I think the total bill for that
                    trip was something like $10 million per day. Marvin Watson, then White House
                    Chief of Staff, said that if anyone ever even whispered that fact, he would
                    personally see to it that the person was decapitated. In those $10 million was
                    even greater than it is today. That Southeast Asia trip went for eleven days; it
                    should not take $110 million to take a President to an international conference.
                    Much of it was funded by other agencies and therefore never public knowledge.
                    The Department had a $1 million appropriation for “Contingencies in the
                    Diplomatic Service”. It didn't go very far when Presidential trips were
                    undertaken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective did you think Lyndon Johnson was on these
                        overseas trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I think Summit diplomacy is really not a worthwhile investment of time
                    and money. Undertaking a trip makes a statement on its own. What is said and
                    done while on the road has little impact. The fact that Lyndon Johnson met
                    individually and in a group with Marcos and other East Asia leaders, including
                    the South Vietnamese, was of no significance. That he took a day off from his
                    diplomatic endeavors and visited our troops in Vietnam, was of importance. That
                    and a few other events provided some short TV sound-bites that had some effect
                    probably on domestic public opinion, but in terms of moving any international
                    issue forward, it had little effect. I found the trips exciting as a worker bee
                    seeing all these leaders close up. I was awed by the resources that could be
                    marshaled to support a Presidential trip, but substantively, the trips were not
                    earth shaking or even of vital national significance.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The trips became easier to manage as we learned the routine. We developed check
                    lists so that we didn't have send embassies scurrying all the time to find
                    tapioca pudding or pickled baby okra or Snappy Tom in the middle of the night.
                    We learned and had these items on hand. Johnson was a man who had peculiar
                    personal tastes. He also needed a lot of extras. For example, he never slept. He
                    had to have his orthopedic chair in his bedroom. We dragged that around from
                    post to post. We leap-frogged extra-wide king sized beds so that one would
                    always be available at his next stop. We developed a total black-out capability
                    because Johnson demanded complete darkness in the room in which he slept. We
                    knew that the shower had to be 7'3” above the floor. The lectern had be 42” on
                    the belly side. We soon found out about all his predilections and were after a
                    while prepared to meet his demands. What we didn't know, the White House staff
                    or the White House Communications Agency (WHCA) knew. A lot of egos had of
                    course to be massaged during the course of these trips. I remember that while I
                    was in Manila, I got a call from Air Force 1. The White House staff had the list
                    of room assignments for the hotel it was to use in Manila. Crockett called me
                    and said that the staff wanted to have Jack Valenti (who was no longer in the
                    White House) moved from the room he was occupying—he had arrived in Manila few
                    days earlier—to another floor. I raised my eyebrows, but went to his room and
                    shoved a note under the door saying that the White House had requested that he
                    move from his room to another one on a different floor. I signed it “Control
                    Room” I had just returned to the control room, when my phone rang and Valenti
                    said, “Can you tell me who on the White House staff made the request that I
                    move?”. I told him that I didn't know who had made the decision; I was just
                    passing on the information as I had received it. Valenti said: “I think I'll
                    stay in my room until you can tell me who it was who wants to have me move!”. I
                    called the plane back and reported that Valenti would not move. The issue was
                    abandoned!As it was the hotel was completely booked; we could not have found
                    another room for Valenti. The other Chiefs of State were also looking for rooms
                    and got very little if anything. We had the hotel practically to ourselves, but
                    we were very tight. Bill also called one time to ask what room Liz Carpenter was
                    to occupy. I told him; he then wanted to know whether that was a good room. I
                    told him that that had been the room reserved for him; I am not sure where we
                    finally found a cot for Crockett. There were no other rooms in the hotel and no
                    other good hotels in Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During all these trips, what impression did you form of
                        the White House staff? How much of the irritating demands were the result of
                        staff initiatives rather than Presidential demands?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: In the case of the LBJ White House, most came from the President. Of
                    course, that was one of the reasons he liked Bill because Bill was able to
                    respond to his demands in ways that the Kennedy White House staff would never
                    do. Bill treated him as a VIP and Johnson appreciated that. When he became
                    President, Johnson just wanted to be a bigger VIP. So all the petty demands, I
                    am sure, were Presidentially generated. Anyone else who might have played that
                    game might have asked for the wrong thing or might have gotten in the way of the
                    President; neither situations were to be sought. I have to say that the trips of
                    other Presidents that I have been involved in as part of the “host party” like
                    Kennedy's trip to Rome and Carter's trip to Tokyo and Reagan's trips, were not
                    much better than Johnson's. The requirements were still in effect, although they
                    seem to come less from the President himself than from the staff around him,
                    although I am sure that the Presidents are not reluctant to be served as they
                    are. The entourages are growing with every new President. We now have a Boeing
                    747 as Air Force One, rather that the 707 of the 60's. That increases the number
                    of potential strap hangers greatly. Air Force One is filled with staff; the
                    press charters its own plane. I am willing to bet that there is also a back-up
                    747 flying also filled with White House staffers. So the size of the
                    accompanying staff has increased tremendously since the 60's. It is not that
                    much different when Congressional leaders or groups travel. They also come with
                    staff members, although fewer, of course. But the demands of these groups are
                    also very taxing.</p>
                <p>Late in 1966, Bill Crockett seemed to have lost some interest in his job. He
                    appeared to be more difficult to see and did not appear to share his views with
                    the staff as much as he used to. One day, I received a call from George
                    Springsteen asking me if I knew when Bill was leaving. That took me by surprise
                    because I had had no inkling of any such occurrence. Springsteen seemed
                    surprised that I didn't know; he assumed that Bill had told his staff since he
                    had announced his intentions to the Under Secretary. To this day, I don't know
                    what triggered Bill's decision to resign. He may have felt that he was
                    unappreciated by the Foreign Service or there may have been some problem that
                    just got to be too much for him. I just don't know. Or the hours may have
                    finally just worn him down. He used to arrive very early in the morning, as I
                    mentioned, to dictate the ideas he had had overnight. I usually got to the
                    office around 8 a.m. and we all stayed then roughly for twelve hours. So it was
                    a long, long day, particularly for Bill who probably spent 14 hours in the
                    office every day; he was there Saturdays mornings as well, but never on Sundays
                    unless there was an emergency. He may just have worn down; he had been Deputy
                    Under Secretary for 3 � years.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I suspect that there was also some tension between Ball and Crockett that finally
                    caused Bill to submit his resignation. Late in 1966, there was an incident
                    involving Wayne Hayes and George Ball. Hayes had become deeply involved in the
                    Foreign Building operations. One of his interventions concerned our building
                    down in Bogota, Colombia. Our Ambassador there had decided on a new building to
                    be rented and felt very strongly that he had selected the right one. Hayes was
                    getting different information from other sources and opposed the rent of the
                    Bogota building. All arrangements had been finalized, but Hayes was refusing to
                    authorize any funds for this lease. I am told, and this is second hand, that
                    Ball decided to call Hayes and told the Congressman that he would not tolerate
                    any further interference in State Department's business. Of course, Ball had
                    already decided to resign by this time, but that was not known. Hayes hung up on
                    him and immediately had drafted a bill which was passed by both chambers, taking
                    away some of the Department's leasing authority in the foreign buildings
                    program. Ball was probably just releasing his personal frustration, but it cost
                    the organization heavily. That also probably had an effect on Bill's decision to
                    resign because it was just one more limitation on the Department's ability to
                    manage its own affairs.</p>
                <p>In any case, he had apparently told Ball that he would stay long enough to go on
                    a final trip with Rooney. That trip was a long journey through Latin
                    America.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>After Springsteen's call, I immediately went to see Betty Donovan, Bill's
                    personal assistant, to seek confirmation of Bill's resignation. She said it was
                    true. She told me that Bill had been offered a job with IBM which he had finally
                    decided to accept. I had never heard of his conversations with IBM; I doubt
                    whether anyone else besides Betty knew about them. I was horrified that Bill had
                    decided to resign and was particularly unhappy that he had decided to leave the
                    Department entirely. I asked him why, at least, he didn't consider taking an
                    ambassadorial assignment; he had supported so many of his colleagues for
                    ambassadorial appointments that at least he should take one himself. That might
                    have permitted him a change of pace, but would allow him to try some of his
                    management techniques even if on a smaller basis. But Bill felt that the Foreign
                    Service would never accept him. I told him I thought he was wrong: the Foreign
                    Service accepted many appointees, many of them not deserving, but they were
                    served well and faithfully by their Foreign Service staffs. I was sure that the
                    Foreign Service would serve Bill just as loyally. Marshall Jones, who had been
                    one of Bills' assistants, had been appointed as Ambassador to Malawi. I really
                    did not believe that Bill was right in his judgement about the Foreign Service.
                    But he wouldn't accept my arguments; he said that he wouldn't wish to put Verla
                    through what might be contentious Senate hearings. He was just adamant about
                    resigning even though I believe that he, by the end of 1966, had come to believe
                    that the Foreign Service saw him more benignly than it had a year earlier. After
                    I joined the staff and began to be a regular traveler with Bill, I would
                    arrange, time permitting, for Bill to meet alone with the staffs at overseas
                    posts we visited. He would tell them briefly about his plans and aspirations for
                    the Department and the Foreign Service and then would answer any questions that
                    they might have. Those session, I think, were very useful to both sides. I
                    thought that Bill was receiving positive feed-back from the overseas staffs,
                    which to some extent should have been comforting and reassuring to him about the
                    Service's views. I was somewhat disappointed later when I read Bill's oral
                    history; he seemed to still have somewhat bitter memories about the Foreign
                    Service. I regret that greatly because there were many people in the Foreign
                    Service who respected him. There were some who didn't, but that was to be
                    expected. I always had his picture in my office after I worked for him because I
                    happen to believe that he was the most impressive and dedicated boss that I have
                    ever worked for.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>When Bill's last days came, the Secretary had a farewell reception for him on the
                    8th. floor. All the principals of the Department were there as well as some of
                    Bill's staff and some others. I can still remember Dean Rusk, in making his
                    speech, saying that his job had been easier because he had always Crockett at
                    his right hand to say “NO” when necessary. I thought that was one of the most
                    misguided and uncalled for remarks that I had ever heard. Bill Crockett had
                    spent more than three years in finding ways to get things done; “NO” was not a
                    word he liked to use or in fact did use very much. His whole human fiber was
                    attuned to saying “YES”; he had spent a whole career trying to support people so
                    that they could function better; he had always tried to find ways to accommodate
                    requests; he had drummed that approach into his staff. For the Secretary to call
                    him a “NO MAN” at the end of his career, I thought, was most inappropriate..
                    Bill, I am sure, was chagrined. I wrote a note afterwards saying that I thought
                    the Secretary was 180% wrong. I was just astounded and I believe that it said
                    more about Rusk and his knowledge of what was going on in the management of his
                    Department than it did about Bill.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I think Bill Crockett's tenure did a lot of good for the
                    Department of State. He widened the base of the Foreign Service in ways that I
                    consider largely constructive. He enhanced the role of management without
                    diminishing career principles. He made the Department a far greater master of
                    its own internal process than had previously been the case. That is not to say
                    that all of his innovations were successful. His reputation was tarnished by
                    such initiatives like the ACCORD program. The Department could have done without
                    that; it didn't help the management of the Department nor did it change the
                    Department's culture to be more “open”. There may have been other approaches
                    that may have been taken, but ACCORD was not the right one. CCPS also falls in
                    the category of failed efforts; it was very expensive and didn't produce any
                    positive results. All of the great gurus, who were called upon as advisors, like
                    Allen Enthoven, Charlie Hitch and others, eventually also became discouraged and
                    threw up their hands in surrender.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>On the other hand, I think that “management by objectives” was a successful
                    management technique. That helped people to focus on their activities and
                    arrange their goals in some priority, although efforts to use that technique on
                    a Service-wide scale were never successful. He was also a great boon to the
                    Foreign Service because he introduced administrative programs which made the
                    Foreign Service more effective. I am dismayed that so few know that it was Bill
                    Crockett who made their lives easier and better. I always resented Outerbridge
                    Horsey's role in the inspection of Embassy Rome which took place in the
                    mid-60's. That report savaged and devastated Crockett who was the administrative
                    officer; the inspectors took umbrage at the many innovations Bill had introduced
                    to the Embassy to make the life of the Foreign Service officers and staff so
                    much easier at no cost to the American tax-payer. For example, he started the
                    practice of the administrative section taking the cash for the monthly charges
                    on a staff member's utility bill and paying to the local utility office. It
                    would have taken that staff member hours and hours to do the same thing, but by
                    having an Embassy local employee take on the burden, it saved a much more highly
                    paid staff member time which could be devoted to his job. He did that in many
                    ways although none of the measures were major management changes, but provided
                    support here and there for the substantive staff so that it could work more
                    productively. It was a different support that Horsey and his other colleagues
                    had been accustomed to in their younger days and therefore they severely
                    chastised Bill for his efforts. These senior officers' views were summed up by
                    their scathing comments about the Embassy commissary selling canned spaghetti or
                    sauce. Fortunately, the inspection report had little effect on Embassy
                    operations and many of Bill's initiatives are still around today. But Bill was
                    no doubt hurt, not career-wise, but personally.</p>
                <p>While Bill was traveling with Rooney, John Steeves, who was then the Director
                    General, became acting Deputy Under Secretary. John was never a real member of
                    the Crockett team. John had his own agenda. I was the one who suggested him when
                    the Director General's position became vacant. Bill was intrigued by having on
                    his staff a senior Foreign Service Officer who had not entered up through the
                    examination process; Steeves had “lateraled in” through the Man-power Act.
                    Steeves became very pompous very fast. He had been our Ambassador to Afghanistan
                    and I think that went to his head. He was certainly not a personnel manager; he
                    was not a very effective Director General. Beyond that, he didn't agree with
                    many of Bill's initiatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>When Bill came back from his trip, he took his papers and worked in a little
                    office in the Deputy Under Secretary's suite. Steeves occupied the main office.
                    Crockett was still officially the Deputy Under Secretary; no replacement had
                    been named, but he was concentrating on closing up his career in the Department
                    of State. Bill continued to send memos to me on matters that he would like to
                    have done, as he had always done. I would write “action” memoranda to the
                    appropriate program manager; it was the routine that we had long practiced. One
                    issue that came up in this interim period concerned a physical move for one part
                    of the Office of Personnel from one floor to another. Bill had originally
                    approved of the idea; then someone came to complain and Bill sent me a note
                    asking that the move be rescinded. I passed that word to Bob Peck, who decided
                    to raise the issue at the next staff meeting because he was apparently confused.
                    Steeves got absolutely furious. After the meeting, he asked me to stay and he
                    really lit into me. He wanted to know how I, a lowly assistant, could over-rule
                    a decision that had been made. He further said that Bill Crockett had told him
                    that he would not involve himself in day-to-day issues. I told him what had
                    transpired; that I had gotten my instructions from Crockett who, as far as I
                    knew, was still the Deputy Under Secretary and I was still his special
                    assistant. Therefore, when I got instructions from Crockett, I followed them.
                    Steeves said that I was not to do that again. He was livid. I told him to take
                    it up with Crockett.</p>
                <p>After a few weeks of this interim, Idar Rimestad was appointed as Deputy Under
                    Secretary. He was Rooney's choice for the job. He was not anyone else's choice;
                    I don't think he was even Bill's choice. Bill's candidate was Jack Herfurt, who
                    was then Counselor for Administration in Rome. Jack would have been a much
                    better choice for that job. Idar could get things done, but he would break a lot
                    of crockery in the process. He was certainly not a smooth, polished operator
                    like Herfurt. I think that Idar's selection probably took place one evening at
                    Duke Zeibert's over a drink or two. Rooney must just have decided that Idar had
                    been a faithful servant who had managed to get things done for the Chairman. As
                    far as I know, the White House of course approved the nomination, but did not
                    involve itself any further than that. Rooney shortly thereafter fell terminally
                    ill, but Idar became Deputy Under Secretary nevertheless. I left the staff to go
                    to the War College, even though Rimestad asked me to stay. I told him that I
                    would stay for a brief period just to tide him over, but, as a Crockett
                    follower, I was not the person he wanted because I could only tell him how
                    things used to be and that would eventually become very tiresome to him. He did
                    ask me for suggestions for replacement and eventually Pat Byrne was appointed.
                    Ed Adams retired and was replaced by Jules Bassin. Roy Little had taken ill and
                    was followed by Frank Meyer in the job of budget liaison with the Congress and
                    managing the confidential funds. Bill Trone also got sick and was replaced by
                    Bob Peck. Joe Meresman left, so that a few weeks after Rimestad's appointment,
                    there was an entirely fresh crew in “M”.</p>
                <p>I stayed long enough to accompany President Johnson and Idar to Germany for the
                    Adenauer funeral. I also went with Humphrey to Korea. Later, even after starting
                    the War College, I was desperately afraid that I would be asked to support the
                    Johnson around-the-world trip which ended in the Vatican on Christmas Eve.
                    Fortunately, it didn't happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>When I said that I wanted to go to the War College, Idar said he understood, but
                    that he hoped that as long as I was working in “M” I would free to tell him that
                    he was wrong when I thought so. I did indeed use that invitation on a couple of
                    occasions. I don't think Idar really liked that. For example, he had decided
                    that he would manage his operations through an underground network of old
                    friends who were strategically located in various offices. He would sit down at
                    a large table in the cafeteria in the morning and while having breakfast, he
                    would discuss problems with his old friends, who knew they could catch him at
                    that time and give him their opinions.</p>
                <p>We had one argument over how the Department's communications network would
                    operate. One of Idar's friends, during one of the infamous breakfasts, told him
                    the Department's system was not very good. In fact, it was great and best of
                    all, CIA was paying for a major portion of it. The diplomatic communications
                    system, which was very good, was built in fact on CIA's budget; their people
                    helped staff it, support it and pay for it. Idar was told that by some “Morse
                    code” communicator that in some fashion the Department was being robbed blind. I
                    finally wrote him a memorandum, explaining how the system worked and asking for
                    policy guidance if he wanted to change it. I took it to him; he took it and
                    ostentatiously placed it on the corner of desk that was reserved for matters
                    that he didn't have intention of ever addressing. I told him that he couldn't do
                    that; he could not ignore our communications system. He looked at me and didn't
                    react. I then told him that I was going to use the invitation he had extended me
                    when he first came into office; I told him he was flatly wrong. He glared at me
                    and I left the room. About an hour later, he walked into my office, with the
                    memorandum in his hands; he slammed it on my desk and I noticed he had approved
                    my recommendation. As he left, he said that this was the last time he would ever
                    do anything like that. In the final analysis, Idar did not get along very well
                    with the communications staff, despite my efforts.</p>
                <p>In the few months that I worked for Idar, he changed a number of Crockett'
                    initiatives. For example, he alienated Eddie Williams, who Bill had chosen to
                    head up the Department Equal Opportunity Employment Office. I think Eddie sensed
                    that Idar was not committed to minority opportunity philosophy as Bill was. So
                    he also left and was replaced by an Afro-American who however had no real
                    standing in the black community as Eddie had.</p>
                <p>Idar went into battle against Steeves. They would get into arguments, both
                    publicly and privately. Steeves would threaten to take the issue up with the
                    Secretary, which never happened, but it was a hopeless match. It was
                    confrontation that Steeves could not possibly win since Idar was the Deputy
                    Under Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Bill had always been very adroit in finding some task for a senior person, such
                    as an ex-Ambassador, who might himself or herself temporarily unemployed. Those
                    tasks, which they performed individually or as part of a group, gave these
                    people a dignity and self esteem which they badly needed when the Service could
                    not come up with another assignment. These temporary assignments permitted these
                    people to leave the Department with heads held high, rather than just being
                    unceremoniously being dumped into retirement, as the law permitted the
                    Department to do. Idar though that that process was mostly a waste of time and
                    money. Outerbridge Horsey, who had been asked by Bill to review the Junior
                    Officers' Recruitment Program and Training, produced a report after the review.
                    Idar savaged Horsey, face to face, after he read the report. It was one of the
                    most brutal meetings I have ever attended. It was insulting and demeaning to a
                    person who had devoted the major portion of his life to the Foreign Service.
                    Horsey left that meeting a shaken man. There was no need for that kind of
                    punishment. The report was not that controversial and Horsey was obviously at
                    the end of his career. Idar just didn't like the process or perhaps even the
                    “old line” Foreign Service Officers. Idar was not a genius when it came to
                    getting along with people.</p>
                <p>He also had a different view of the goals of “management”. For example, he
                    thought that Barrett's operations had no place in the Department and he
                    dissolved that office soon after taking over as “M”. He did not see any benefit
                    in having an “Arts In Embassy” program or Katie Louchheim's efforts to raise
                    America's awareness of the Foreign Service. Those kinds of efforts just did not
                    fit in Idar's definition of “management”.</p>
                <p>I was very interested in going to the War College. Selections were made by a
                    committee and therefore not easily subject to pressure or influence. Every FSO-3
                    was automatically considered for senior training. At a later stage in my career,
                    I participated in the selection process and learned a little about the various
                    considerations involved in making the selections first for senior training and
                    then for the specific training program. It is as objective as any personnel
                    process can be and I was delighted that I was selected. I had had friends who
                    had attended the War College who had found it a very interesting assignment. I
                    also thought that it was an appropriate time in my career to take a year off for
                    academic pursuits. It gave me an opportunity to become reacquainted with my
                    family which probably had forgotten what I looked like after the hours I spent
                    in “M” and on the road with various VIPs. I couldn't have been happier when I
                    was selected, especially since the senior training assignment was the War
                    College which I preferred to the Senior Seminar because I thought that the War
                    College provided closer interaction with the U.S. military which would be very
                    instructive and might pay off to a greater degree later in my career. It
                    certainly met both of my expectations. I often ran across classmates
                    subsequently and the fact that we had known each other during that year was very
                    helpful in establishing a close working relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>So I enjoyed my year at the War College. It was the one year that Andy Goodpaster
                    was the Commandant, which added a special dimension. At the time, the War
                    College still had planes at its disposal which permitted the students to choose
                    a visit to one of five different areas. I opted for Africa because I had never
                    been there, except for Casablanca. That trip was a great experience; we took
                    three weeks to travel throughout the Continent and saw and learned a lot. I
                    thought that a year away from a desk which permitted time for reflection and
                    learning is a very valuable asset; it is also very useful for the breathing time
                    it provides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the War College, you were assigned to Tokyo. Was
                        that your choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I had actually hoped to go to Seoul as the Political Counselor. I had
                    just received a promotion to FSO-2 while at the War College which made me
                    eligible for that assignment. I had been in Korea many years before, as I
                    described earlier. Bill Porter became Ambassador in the Summer of 1967. He had
                    been part of the U.S. delegation headed by Hubert Humphrey that went to the Park
                    Chung Hee inauguration the year before. As I mentioned, I had worked on the
                    preparation for that visit and had accompanied the delegation. So I met Porter
                    on that trip and I took the opportunity to tell him I was interested in that
                    job—he had already been announced as our next Ambassador by that time—even
                    though I was not eligible for an assignment until the following year. Sending a
                    newly appointed, but not announced, Ambassador as part of a delegation made
                    matters a little tricky for the Charge' who at that time was George Newman. In
                    any case, Porter eventually chose Dick Peters for the job of Political Counselor
                    and the then the Bureau offered me the job as Principal Officer at Kobe-Osaka.
                    As it turned out, that was probably the better assignment for me in any
                    case.</p>
                <p>The Consulate General at Kobe-Osaka in 1968 was approximately 10-12 Americans.
                    The Consular Section was in Kobe and the Administrative Section moved from Kobe
                    to Osaka and back. The Economic Section was in Osaka. I worked in Osaka
                    primarily because that was the location of the World Exposition which as my main
                    focus for the years I was the C.G. All of the other normal activities of the
                    post really took second place.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat unique in the Foreign Service to have a Consulate General with two
                    main offices, separated by roughly thirty miles. I did not travel very much
                    between the two offices. My predecessors and successors tended to use the office
                    in Kobe to a large extent because it was more spacious and far more pleasant and
                    the commute from the CG's house was far better. But since most of my time was
                    taken up by the Exposition, I stayed in Osaka most of the time. Kobe didn't need
                    any “hands-on” supervision, although, as I said, I would occasionally visit our
                    offices in Kobe. I did travel to Tokyo and to prefectural capitals in my
                    district.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The Consul General in Kobe-Osaka is a unique assignment under any circumstances
                    and was even more so while I was there because of the Exposition. Osaka
                    historically and traditionally was the business center of Japan. All of the
                    large industrial combines—Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, etc.—had started in Osaka and
                    had kept their roots there. By the end of the war, it became apparent that Tokyo
                    would become the center of Japan. So the CEO's and business leaders, while
                    maintaining their homes in the Osaka area, spent most of their time in Tokyo
                    because that became the center of commercial activity. All of these business
                    leaders maintained a sympathetic and sentimental attachment to the land of their
                    forefathers. Therefore, when the U.S. first established its posts in Japan right
                    after the War—i.e. the diplomatic branches of the Military Government—Osaka was
                    a natural place for a presence. Osaka was one of the Japanese cities that have a
                    special designation—along with Kyoto and Tokyo (as illustrated by the fact that
                    the Tokyo city administrator is a governor, not a mayor). The Osaka is a Fu,
                    which is a higher rank than a Shi, which is the next level. Kobe, however, also
                    merited attention. There always existed great rivalry between Osaka and Kobe.
                    They are in two different prefectures. Traditionally, the U.S. had had a
                    presence in Kobe because it was a major port. After the War, Osaka also became a
                    major port. It became clear to one of my predecessors that having only a
                    presence in Kobe was insufficient; so the Department rented space for him in
                    Osaka and gradually the post became known as Kobe-Osaka. While I was there, we
                    requested that the post designation be changed to Osaka-Kobe as an indicator of
                    the changed importance of the two cities. Kobe, of course, was greatly
                    distressed by the change, but I felt that the new designation was a far more
                    accurate description of the situation on the ground. Nevertheless, I still had
                    to deal with two sets of Japan-American societies, two sets of city government
                    officials. I suppose that a foreign Consul General in Minneapolis-St. Paul might
                    face the same problems, although those two cities are closer together than Osaka
                    and Kobe were. I had to do a certain amount of representation with the city
                    officials of both municipalities, but there was very little if any official
                    business conducted. That just wasn't necessary and I kept it to the bare
                    minimum. There were consular corps in both cities which had to be periodically
                    called out for some civic function or other—building dedication, ribbon cutting,
                    Miss Kobe contests, etc.</p>
                <p>We built a beautiful new Consulate building in Kobe. It was clear from the
                    beginning, even before people moved in, that this was a summer palace. It never
                    was fully utilized; it always had empty office space. Many of the rooms intended
                    for offices became storage space. It was a great waste of money. During my tour
                    as C.G., I continued the efforts started by Owen Zurhellen to consolidate staffs
                    so that we could all be together in one city, which had to be Osaka. Long after
                    my departure, that consolidation took place; we now are only in Osaka and the
                    office building in Kobe has been sold—to finance the new building in Osaka.
                    Because of the Japanese tax system, which charges you by the ground square
                    footage, we wound up building a very beautiful tall square edifice in Osaka. So
                    in summary, U.S. representation started in Kobe, slowly over many years shifted
                    to Osaka and is now entirely in Osaka. We still do some consular work in Kobe,
                    trying to help the shipping and travel industry, but our base is in Osaka.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>My principal contacts were the business people in Osaka. I spent a lot of time
                    supporting the American business community, which consisted of 60 or 70 people
                    involved in joint ventures or building nuclear plants, representing 40 to 50
                    companies. There was a branch of the Japan-American Chamber of Commerce in
                    Kobe-Osaka, I thought the Americans needed more support than they were getting
                    from that source. So I worked hard at keeping them aware of what was going on in
                    the foreign policy arena. The American companies had already penetrated the
                    Japanese market by the late 60's. We had American banks—e.g. the Bank of
                    America—, American businesses—e.g. Goodyear-Sumitomo, Dupont—accounting firms,
                    airlines, services—e.g. Northwest and Pan American—, construction companies—e.g.
                    General Electric, which was building a nuclear power plant.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of traveling, doing representational work. The consular district was
                    very large, covering fourteen or fifteen prefectures, covering the island of
                    Shikoku and on the main island, almost from Hiroshima to Nagoya and from the
                    Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan. Hiroshima was of course a place of concern;
                    it was politically sensitive and we tried very hard to keep good relationships
                    with that city and the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, which consisted of 50 or
                    60 Americans who worked there. There were many missionaries in our consular
                    district, most of whom lived in the rural areas. I started a program in which I
                    and one of my staff would spend a day in one prefecture, trying to explain what
                    the American Consulate General could do for the locals in terms of services.
                    That included not only consular services, but also trade assistance for those
                    Japanese that wanted to trade with the United States. That program was not
                    always successful, but I think it provided the Japanese a better understanding
                    of why an American diplomatic establishment was set-up. I have mixed feelings
                    about the role of constituent posts. It is not always clear to me that they are
                    always necessary; it depends largely on the country whether they are effective
                    and how useful they are. In the case of Osaka-Kobe, it was a very productive
                    operation. We used to issue three or four million visas each year; that was when
                    we still required visas for all visitors to the United States. The staff that
                    handled that work-load consisted of only three Americans and five or six locals.
                    It is true that most of the visas were for visitors, there were only a few
                    immigrant visa cases processed. What helped us, of course, was the assistance of
                    the travel agencies which filled out, or had filled out, all the basic visa
                    application papers. They used to bring these large batches of applications for
                    the groups that they were taking to the United States. Without the travel
                    agencies, I don't think we could have handled the work-load with such a small
                    staff. Many of the Japanese used to go on group tours to Hawaii or Guam; some
                    went to the United States, mainly to the West Coast. These tour packages were
                    relatively cheap and the Japanese are great group tourists. The large number of
                    visitors was an indication of the economic recovery that Japan enjoyed
                    twenty-five years after the War. The tourist agencies would charter a JAL plane,
                    loaded it with its customers and off they went to an inexpensive hotel. It was
                    not very expensive, but there were enough Japanese by this time who could afford
                    that small expenditure so that the visa issuance work-load was very high. The
                    yen in the late '60s was still 360 to a dollar—those were the great days for
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>The Osaka-Kobe consular district was also very busy on commercial matters. The
                    two way trade between that district and the U.S. was almost as large as the U.S.
                    trade with the Common Market. The two-way trade at the end of the '60s was very
                    large. The trade deficits were not yet the problem they were to become, although
                    we could see glimmers of difficulties ahead. Much of the export from Osaka-Kobe
                    were textiles; it also exported metals, minerals, pharmaceuticals and other
                    manufactured goods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me how it felt to be a United States representative
                        when you visited Hiroshima—the site of our first atomic bombing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: It was a remarkable experience. In Hiroshima then and even today, one
                    can clearly see some of the destruction caused by the bomb. You can always see
                    the ruined dome which was the site of a pre-war Exposition. You can see the
                    Noguchi mausoleum, a memorial for the hundreds of thousands who died. That is a
                    site that everyone visits, and the Japanese burn incense or deposit paper cranes
                    in front of it. There is an Atomic Bomb Museum that has horrifying exhibits of
                    the many types of damage that was done; however, the exhibits are crowded and
                    rather poorly presented—I understand it is better today. Most of the exhibits
                    were in large glass cases so that the horror was not as fully exploited as they
                    might have been. Around these terrible reminders of a terrible catastrophe, the
                    city has developed into a hustling, bustling community with a major automobile
                    plant—Mazda had its headquarters near Hiroshima. By the late '60s the city had
                    been rebuilt and was functioning well. As was true for all cities that had been
                    bombed, Hiroshima was rebuilt in a much more sensible fashion with a grid, much
                    more able to handle modern traffic than it could have managed had it remained as
                    it was pre-war. While I was Consul General, the prefecture had a young, active
                    governor who compared himself to John Kennedy because he had also commanded a PT
                    boat and was about the same age. Hiroshima had one of the most active
                    America-Japan societies in my district.</p>
                <p>There was an American Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission which consisted of
                    scientists studying the genetic after-effects of the radiation created by the
                    bomb. That Commission had records on everybody who was anywhere near the
                    epicenter, how far away they had been at the time of the explosion, etc. The
                    Commission gave an annual physical examination to each victim. Even though
                    working in a country like Japan, where autopsies are rare and seen as
                    irreverent, the Commission conducted autopsies as the victims died; the local
                    population willingly supported this deviation from their social mores. All the
                    information was on computers. The Commission increasingly became a joint
                    operation until today it is almost entirely Japanese managed and staffed. In my
                    days, the Americans were in charge of the Commission and as I mentioned before,
                    we had about 50-60 doctors and public health experts living in Hiroshima.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The Hiroshima population was warm and friendly. It was extraordinarily
                    cooperative, even more so than in other Japanese cities. I don't want to
                    underplay in any way the devastation that the atomic bomb caused, but Hiroshima
                    was not taken over by drum-beating, placard-waiving peace activists that might
                    be expected and that could be seen in other Japanese cities and sometimes at
                    international disarmament conferences where they became self-appointed advocated
                    for “Hiroshima victims.” Of course, there were many Hiroshima citizens who had
                    strong opinions on disarmament, but they were not the disruptive publicity
                    seeking kinds that one found elsewhere. The United States was not criticized
                    because it had dropped the atomic bomb. We were perceived as Japan's allies. The
                    US presence in Hiroshima, which consisted of a small USIS library in addition to
                    the bomb Commission, was very welcome. I used to go to Hiroshima frequently
                    because I arrived in Osaka-Kobe two years before the 25th anniversary of the
                    bombing which was 1970. Alexis Johnson, then our Ambassador to Japan, had not
                    paid an official visit to Hiroshima; soon after my arrival, I organized an
                    Ambassadorial visit. So I was in Hiroshima within the first two weeks after my
                    arrival in Osaka-Kobe. Reischauer had, of course, been there earlier; I think he
                    visited almost every prefecture in Japan. But I am not aware on any special
                    attention that the U.S. establishment in Tokyo paid to Hiroshima also Reischauer
                    may have done something special because he was the kind of person who would have
                    thought in terms of Hiroshima's history. But in general, our Ambassadors didn't
                    have the time or resources to devote too much attention to Hiroshima or most
                    cities outside of Tokyo. I found Hiroshima fascinating; I felt some inspiration
                    when I saw how the people had risen from a devastating blow and had turned their
                    tragedy into into a positive asset. The bombing was part the city's history,
                    which they respected, but they would not let that dominate their lives. They
                    built a vibrant economy and looked to the future and not the past. They were
                    more interested in re-establishing a major industrial center than in wallowing
                    in their past.</p>

                <p>In general, the Japanese were remarkable for overcoming their major military
                    defeat and the scars, both physical and psychological of war. It was not so much
                    a matter of “forgiving and forgetting” as it was a matter of perception of life
                    as a continuing and moving experience. Events both positive and negative happen;
                    they can not be denied, but the present and the future are more important than
                    the sanctification of the past. The Japanese are known for their ancestor
                    worship which is an integral of the Confucian tradition. They do not have a
                    central and dominant religious belief — certainly not an institutional one.
                    Shintoism revolves around propitiation of natural deities, many representing
                    various natural forces like wind and fire. It is not an ethical system.
                    Confucianism is the ethical system that dominates Japan and Korea. It does not
                    have a Supreme Being at its center like Buddhism, but it is more oriented to
                    giving some structure to daily life. Buddhism centers on the search for
                    perfection and the “after life”. The three philosophical strains co-exist in
                    Japan and often reinforce each other as the same person may show allegiance to
                    two or all three strains. You are born Buddhist and you die Buddhist—there are
                    ceremonies for each. You are married in a Shinto shrine, but you live as a
                    Confucian. Christian penetration of Japan has been minimal; its adherents have
                    remained at about the same number since the 17th Century—about one million,
                    mostly Catholic. Protestant missionaries have had relatively little success in
                    Japan unlike Korea, where they did have an impact. Japanese do not worship every
                    week; there are holidays that are important, but religion as we know it is not a
                    central theme in Japanese life. Many have a family shrine which is used for
                    offerings to ancestral gods, but Japanese life does not revolve around
                    religion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that the International Exhibition
                        became your predominant occupation soon after your arrival in Osaka-Kobe in
                        July 1968. Were plans already underway for that major event when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: The planning for the US participation were well underway in Washington.
                    Howard Chernoff had been named as Commissioner-General and had assembled a
                    staff, under the aegis of USIA which was the lead agency for the Exhibition. He
                    spent some time in raising private American financial contributions which are
                    always necessary if the US is to make any kind of showing. He also supervised
                    the architectural work for the US Pavilion. There was also a small staff already
                    in being when I arrived in Osaka detached from the C.G. devoted to this major
                    enterprise. It was going to be a big deal. Every major company was going to have
                    at least a booth. The local Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary club and other
                    organizations were entirely focused on the Exhibition, even though it would not
                    open for another two years. There was a large clock in the center of Osaka which
                    counted down the days until the opening.Ground had not yet been broken for the
                    US Pavilion; so I was there for the first shovel-load. Chernoff moved to Osaka
                    in 1969. I had some experience with Expositions since I had been involved in the
                    closing of the one that had been held in Brussels. I had noticed that
                    Commissioner-Generals and Ambassadors seemed always to be at odds about who was
                    the chief US representative. I was determined that such a situation would not
                    occur in Osaka and that the State Department and Exposition staffs would
                    collaborate fully. There would no competition for being “top dog”. I saw the
                    Exposition as a tremendous opportunity for the United States which I was not
                    going to have messed up by “turf” warfare. There was enough work to go around
                    for everyone. The CG was besieged by a steady stream of visitors, most of whom
                    knew little about Japan and we anticipated having to help a lot of visitors with
                    the usual traumas of unpleasant incidents like lost hotel reservations, lost
                    belongings, thievery, etc. The Exhibition was scheduled to last 6-8 months,
                    which meant that there would be an extended period of visitors, whose potential
                    problems would be the responsibility of the Consulate General, while the
                    Commissioner-General could concentrate on the problems of the Pavilion and the
                    exhibitors. I called on Howard before I left Washington and then I hosted
                    receptions for him once he had established his quarters in Osaka. So we
                    developed a very close relationship. He was sensitive to my problems as I was to
                    his. We tried to have our respective staffs mingle so that there was good
                    cooperation at that level as well. In the end, I think our efforts paid off.</p>
                <p>My days would start with a drive to our building in Osaka, which always took over
                    an hour since I lived half-way between Osaka and Kobe. It was a long commute,
                    even though most of it took place over a super-highway; even in those days,
                    traffic was bumper to bumper—”natural clogging” as the Japanese would describe
                    it. Then I might have a luncheon engagement in Kyoto which was 30-40 miles away.
                    That was another hour's drive. After lunch, I might go to Senri Hills where the
                    Exposition was being built. Although there was good public transportation
                    available, my schedule was such that I had to use the car and I spent much of my
                    time just going from one engagement to another. I think I was in my official car
                    on an average of 100-150 miles each day I was in the Osaka-Kobe area.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The Exposition kept me very busy. I had to represent the United States at every
                    ground breaking ceremony, at every national day and at every reception for a
                    Japanese or foreign VIP visitor—e.g. when Prince Charles of Great Britain or the
                    twin sister of the Shah of Iran appeared. These social occasions invariably took
                    place at the Exposition grounds, not in town, which meant another long
                    round-trip. Sometimes, the foreign visit coincided with a national day
                    celebration. Then we would send special groups to the Exhibition like Ozawa and
                    the San Francisco Symphony; they performed at the Osaka Festival Hall. At one
                    time, there was a film festival in honor of the Exhibition. All of these events
                    required me, as the Consul General and the senior U.S. representative in the
                    area, to attend some social event, unless of course I was sick or out of town.
                    It would not have been acceptable to send a substitute. That made for a huge
                    representational work-load, most of it meaningless and unproductive, generated
                    primarily by the Exposition. All Consul Generals have some representational
                    work-load, but nothing compared to one who has a major international exhibition
                    in this geographical area. These continual social requirements started sometime
                    before the opening of the Exposition and during the Exposition, which lasted for
                    several months, as I have mentioned earlier. My representational
                    responsibilities were not lightened at all by the presence of a U.S.
                    Commissioner-General. Protocol required that we both attend this endless series
                    of social occasions.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived in Osaka-Kobe, I tried to establish a “management by
                    objectives” system for the Consulate General. The consular program of course was
                    already well established and ran smoothly and didn't need much of my supervisory
                    time, despite the fact that we were the second largest visa issuing post in the
                    world—Tokyo was the largest. Political and economic reporting was not a major
                    concern, but commercial work was important. That usually consumed the work of
                    two American officers and several local employees. The Exposition certainly
                    increased the Commercial Section's work-load just because more American
                    businessmen came into our district and requested information about commercial
                    opportunities. Franchising was becoming an important aspect of business
                    opportunities at the time. It was about this time, for example, that Kentucky
                    Fried Chicken started in Japan with a concession at the Exposition. That was the
                    start; other American firms soon followed with their outlets. The Commercial
                    officers were very much involved in helping the American franchisers establish
                    their networks in Japan. We also worked closely with the American business
                    community to help them expand their investments. The Exposition did not have a
                    major impact on US-Japan trade which was already well developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The Exposition and related activities became a major factor in our work-loads. My
                    deputy, Rod Armstrong, put together a loose-leaf notebook, in both English and
                    Japanese, that was intended to assist American visitors. It included such
                    information as doctors, attorneys, hotels, restaurants, etc. A copy was
                    available at the front desk of all the hotels in town for the use of Americans
                    with questions or problems.. If the guest needed any services and if he or she
                    couldn't communicate, the hand-book was intended to overcome the language
                    barrier. As it turned out, it was not needed nearly as much as we anticipated.
                    We did a lot of contingency planning, but in the final analysis, we found out
                    that the Japanese were well organized and we didn't encounter any serious
                    problems. The most exciting event during the Exposition came when two of
                    Czechoslovakian guides one night decided that they wanted to defect. They
                    consulted with some of the other Exposition staff, including some American
                    guides. The guides did not come to us and eventually changed their minds and
                    went back to Prague.</p>
                <p>The Exposition was a terrific boon to Osaka and to Japan as a whole, just as the
                    Olympics had been for Tokyo and Japan in 1964. I was in Italy at the time, but I
                    benefitted from the Tokyo Olympics because the Japanese rebuilt their city
                    traffic paths; they built a super-highway system, which was the latest in urban
                    planning although they have had to expand it several times since then. The Osaka
                    Exposition did the same thing for the Konsai. A whole new network of highways
                    and roads were constructed in and around Osaka. A whole new infrastructure arose
                    on an amazing dimension, bringing with it thousands of jobs both in construction
                    and other commercial enterprises. So the Exposition had an enormous impact on
                    Osaka's economy as well as that of the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to ask about the CG's relationship with the
                        Embassy and with the Department in Washington. Did you get much supervision
                        from either?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Not very much. In fact, I was surprised by the amount of autonomy I
                    enjoyed. I had never been a principal officer before and it was the first time I
                    was really on my own. I had expected closer supervision particularly by the
                    Embassy. I was pleased that I was given as much flexibility as I did. I took
                    pains to keep the Embassy informed of my activities and events in my district.
                    Dave Osborn was the DCM to Ambassador Alexis Johnson and it was to him that I
                    reported. The Embassy did not have a Supervisory Consul General—a job that was
                    often seen in the Foreign Service in earlier years. Dave decided that a monthly
                    letter from each of the constituent posts was adequate for supervisory purposes.
                    That enabled him to keep track of the major events around the country. If he had
                    any special requirements, he would phone or write. We were in touch as necessary
                    with all of the Embassy sections when we needed help or guidance. We had a close
                    liaison with the consular and commercial sections especially. We had a branch
                    USIA operation in Osaka, which was autonomous. We were quartered in the same
                    building, but the Osaka USIA office was not part of the Consulate General. This
                    was during a period when USIS was striving for maximum independence and didn't
                    want to have any Department of State interference with its operations. I always
                    included the USIS Director in my staff meetings so that he could keep abreast of
                    political and economic events; we had a close social and personal relationship,
                    but I never tried to give him any directions or guidance. There were USIS
                    branches in both Kyoto and Osaka; the one in Kobe had been closed before I
                    arrived. The one in Hiroshima was closed during my tour as Consul General. We
                    cooperated and worked well together, but I was well aware of the Agency's
                    concern about its independence.</p>
                <p>Some of our reports went directly to Washington; others were submitted first to
                    the Embassy. We received all material from the Department that was sent to all
                    posts. We only had a limited telegraphic capacity.</p>
                <p>I thought it was important for my staff to know what as going on outside of
                    Osaka. So I instituted a system which permitted one officer to go to Tokyo each
                    week as a courier. He would bring back copies of all the telegrams that the
                    Embassy had received and sent in the previous week. We rotated that assignment
                    throughout the staff so that everybody had an opportunity to go to Tokyo. Once
                    the cables were in the C.G., they were held, under security protection,
                    available for all Americans to read. We didn't have access to the very highly
                    classified material, but the bulk of the telegraphic traffic was available to
                    us. That enabled the staff to keep current on Japanese affairs, certainly, and
                    other world wide events of note. It kept people from becoming too insular.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>That courier run was also used to bring back some of the necessities of life.
                    When I first arrived in Osaka, the Army had a small commissary which was
                    available to State Department employees. It was small, but since the prices for
                    certain basic goods were sky high on the Japanese market, the commissary played
                    a very useful economic role for our staff. For example, meat and liquor, for
                    example, were both very expensive and sometimes scarce on the Japanese market.
                    For those of us with representational responsibilities, it would have been
                    prohibitive to entertain very often if we had to rely entirely on the Japanese
                    market. The commissary closed soon after my arrival, because the US military
                    presence in Osaka or anywhere in our consular district was almost nil by 1968.
                    So we started to order as a group large quantities of the necessities from the
                    commissary in Tokyo. The courier would take that bulk order with him and deliver
                    it to the commissary. We then contracted with a shipping firm to deliver the
                    goods from Tokyo to us.</p>
                <p>There was some rivalry between us and the Soviets at the Exposition. We used to
                    issue bulletins about the number of visitors each of our Pavilions hosted during
                    a period. There was no Soviet consular representation in Osaka. Their only
                    presence was their Exposition staff. We had the better attraction because the
                    moon rocks retrieved by our astronauts were on exhibition in our Pavilion. That
                    was an exclusive; no one else had them. In general, our space exhibit was great.
                    We showed the suits worn by the astronauts, the space modules they used as well
                    as the space ships they actually had flown. The Soviets had huge portraits of
                    Yuri Gagarin holding a dove and mock-ups of their space vehicles which seemed to
                    lack credibility.</p>
                <p>We had a constant stream of visitors to the Exhibition. They frequently were my
                    responsibility rather than Chernoff's. There were some visitors who came just to
                    see the Commissioner-General, but most were in Osaka under State Department
                    auspices and that meant under my charge. I would take them around the
                    Exposition. Then there were a number of Americans who had connections in
                    Washington who, while being in Japan, thought they just had to see the
                    Exposition. There were a lot of Congressional delegations. Even John Rooney with
                    his usual entourage came. I was expected to shepherd the Congressional
                    delegations. The Commissioner-General's office included two protocol officers
                    who did nothing but take care of visitors.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I enjoyed my tour in Osaka. I think I left the staff more unified than I had
                    found it when I first arrived. We started some recreational activities, like
                    field event days with three legged races, tugs-of-war and other contests. We
                    developed a Consul General softball team that played in local leagues. I worked
                    hard to build morale which I think was successful. Even now when I return to
                    Osaka now, the few local employees who are still there from 25 years ago, I am
                    greeted warmly by them and that is very rewarding. We were fortunate to have a
                    good local staff. Employment at the CG was prestigious even after the War and it
                    was a long term arrangement. Our turnover as very small. That was true for the
                    Embassy in Tokyo as well. When 30 and forty year service awards were handed out,
                    the lines of recipients were long. I don't believe we had anyone on our staff
                    who had worked for us before the War, but many of them stated with us right
                    after the War. We did hire a few while I was there, but the turnover of the
                    Japanese staff was minimal. All of our staff were very good.</p>
                <p>I was there for the whole Exposition run. On the last day of the Exposition, I
                    transferred directly to Tokyo to take up my job as Political Counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That transfer took place in September, 1970, I believe.
                        How did that transfer come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN:Armin Meyer became Ambassador to Japan in mid-1969. He was not a very
                    successful Ambassador in Tokyo. The Embassy's morale was very low primarily
                    because of the demands that Mrs. Meyer put on the staff. He had not any
                    experience in East Asian affairs. His forte had been the Middle East where he
                    was Ambassador in Lebanon and Iran. He tried to transfer what he had learned in
                    that part of the world to Japan and had very limited success. Although he tried
                    hard and certainly did his best ,Meyer didn't empathize with the Japanese; he
                    didn't know them or their language. So Meyer was a “new man on the block”. Both
                    he and she had chips on their shoulders particularly with respect to the
                    Japanese experts. So the Embassy was not a particularly happy place. I had an
                    opportunity to meet him several times when he came to visit Osaka and the
                    Exposition. His visits were always major productions which place heavy demands
                    on our limited staff. He came for opening day of the Exposition; he came when
                    David and Julie Eisenhower were with us. Osaka was also the center of the
                    Japanese textile industry and we were in the center of the US-Japan dispute
                    about textile trade. So for all of these reasons, Meyer came to see us eight or
                    nine times in the first year of his tour.</p>
                <p>Meyer traveled a lot, but never visited other posts as often as he came to see
                    us. We got along tolerably well during these visits. During one of the visits,
                    he told me that Dick Ericson, his Political Counselor, was about to be
                    transferred and he wanted me as the replacement. I told him that I would be
                    pleased to take that assignment, but it almost came to nought when we had a
                    major social misunderstanding with Mrs. Meyer. But that was overcome
                    sufficiently that I did transfer to Tokyo. I accepted the job even though I knew
                    the morale situation at the Embassy. I thought that problem was manageable,
                    particularly for the Political Counselor.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>My Japanese language skills were good since I had used Japanese often while in
                    Osaka. No one is ever bilingual in Japanese because of the many different levels
                    of speech which can exclude a foreigner from any particular conversation. But I
                    could express myself in Japanese and be understood. I could get along in most
                    conversations; my Japanese came back to me in Osaka even though I had not spoken
                    it regularly for twelve years.</p>
                <p>Dick Sneider was the DCM. He had come to Tokyo about the same time as Meyer had.
                    Dick had been in the NSC working on Okinawa reversion. He was assigned to the
                    Embassy to finish off that reversion issue. But the then DCM, Osborn, was due
                    for transfer; so Meyer, who needed a DCM, decided he would take Dick even though
                    I think they did not know each other. It was very unusual situation because in
                    those days most Embassies had DCM's who were known personally to the Ambassador.
                    But the Ambassadorial position had been left vacant for six months. I don't know
                    for sure, but common wisdom was that the job had been offered to several people
                    who turned the offer down. It was said that John Rockefeller had been offered
                    the job as well as some other notables with Japanese experience or contact. The
                    story was that Armin Meyer became available after his tour in Iran and Alexis
                    Johnson, by now the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, suggested that Meyer
                    be sent to Japan in the absence of any other acceptable candidate who was
                    willing to go. Alex's view was that any Career Minister in the Foreign Service
                    should be able to take any assignment in the Foreign Service. (Incidentally, I
                    think that is a very defensible opinion.) And that is, according to the
                    grapevine, how Armin Meyer ended up ended up in Japan. One night I got a call
                    from Mr. Hotta, the head of the Sumitomo Bank, asking me whether I knew that a
                    man by the name of Armin Meyer had been appointed to be US Ambassador to Japan.
                    I told him that that sounded very strange in light of Meyer's unfamiliarity with
                    the area. So I was surprised when the nomination was actually made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had met Ambassador Meyer during his visits to Osaka.
                        You knew the DCM, Dick Sneider. Who else was in the Embassy at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Herman Barger was the Economic Minister. He was followed by Les Edmond.
                    Bill Wells was the Station Chief. Alan Carter had come to reorganize the USIA
                    operation in Japan and therefore I knew him from his visits to Osaka. He changed
                    USIA's presence in Japan dramatically, and in the process, of course, ran into
                    some controversy. I knew almost all of the staff in the Political Section.</p>
                <p>The DCM and the Political Section staff were East Asian veterans. The Economic
                    Section had a few East Asian experts, but little Japanese language fluency. In
                    general, the Embassy was well staffed with Japanese experts, many of whom spoke
                    Japanese. The Political Section was all fluent in Japanese.</p>

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: They were good, even though the Vietnam war was still going on. There
                    were a lot of anti-US student demonstrations—it was almost a daily occurrence.
                    All demonstrations were orderly and many quite large. There was absolutely no
                    violence. There were also still some union demonstrations, but they also were
                    primarily non-violent, especially since the police had become so expert in crowd
                    control. By regulation, all the demonstrations had to follow prescribed routes
                    and procedures. Any diversions were promptly and effectively suppressed without
                    bloodshed. But there were a lot of demonstrations, which consisted primarily of
                    sloganeering and chanting and yelling in front of the Embassy. The “Student
                    League Against the War in Vietnam”—the so called Beheiren—was in the forefront
                    of the demonstrations. As I said, labor was also involved as were the Socialist
                    and Communist Parties.</p>
                <p>The Embassy's principal task was the completion of the Okinawa reversion process.
                    We were negotiating at all levels on all aspects of the process. We had no
                    guidelines because the event was unprecedented in world history. Territory has
                    rarely been returned by a victorious power, especially after it had been
                    occupied for many years. Eventual reversion had been foreshadowed by Dulles when
                    he expressed the view that Japan had “residual sovereignty'' over Okinawa. Once
                    that had been said, the Japanese began to center their attention on reversion.
                    The Nixon Administration had managed to get Congressional approval for
                    reversion, even over some opposition, particularly from the Navy. The Navy
                    believed that its bases in Okinawa were essential for maintaining its strategic
                    role in the Pacific, and in the final analysis, the US retained total control
                    over those facilities. The U.S. military was the only part of the US Government
                    that really opposed reversion. The Japanese continued to press us to give back
                    the islands. Prime Minister Sato's statement made during this period that”the
                    U.S. occupation of Japan will not really be over until Okinawa reversion had
                    been accomplished” pretty well summarized the feelings of the country. Dick
                    Sneider, who had spearheaded the reversion process in Washington just continued
                    his role when he became DCM in Tokyo. He conducted the negotiations essentially
                    as a personal matter; he had a small staff—mostly legal people and a
                    Vice-Admiral, who was the Navy's watch-dog to make sure that its interests were
                    protected—reporting to him which worked exclusively on Okinawa reversion. There
                    were others working on Okinawa proper as the High Commissioner sought to work
                    out an amicable procedures and negotiate with Okinawan civil officials. We in
                    the Political Section had little to do with reversion. We were involved when
                    Okinawa was part of larger political issues, but on a day-by-day basis, this
                    issue was handled by Dick and his staff. Whatever economic work had to be done
                    in connection with reversion was done by the Economic Section. We worried about
                    making sure that the professionals in Okinawa retained their rights and
                    privileges when the Japanese took over; we worried about traffic because on
                    Okinawa people drove on the right hand side of the road—US style—which was not
                    true in Japan. So a lot of changes had to occur for reversion to work. The whole
                    reversion process took three years, followed by a short transition period.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>All these negotiations took place while Vietnam was still going on; the treaty
                    permitted us to use the bases to rehabilitate ships and equipment damaged during
                    the war, but did not allow planes to take off from Okinawa and fly directly to
                    Vietnam. We had to go through the process of making a refueling stop elsewhere;
                    the Japanese did not wish to be or to give the appearance of being directly
                    involved in our operations in Vietnam. They supported us logistically and in
                    many other ways. But the use of our bases in Japan to do anything other than
                    protect or defend Japan created a a Constitutional problem for the
                    Japanese..</p>
                <p>Later on, we had a serious problem when the Mayor of Yokohama, who was a
                    Socialist, declared that the streets and bridges of his city were too fragile to
                    carry the heavy tanks and equipment which were being driven to the docks for
                    loading for shipment to Vietnam. We maintained that the US-Japan Security Treaty
                    gave us complete rights to ship material across Japan and between US bases. The
                    Mayor's position turned into a real confrontation and for a time we were in a
                    complete stand-off. Finally, the Foreign Office drew a very circuitous route
                    over mountains and other natural barriers which was certainly the long way
                    around but didn't cross any of the Mayor's bridges. That broke the impasse and
                    we were able to load our ships. This was just one example of the many political
                    difficulties that the Vietnam war created for us in Japan. There were many
                    Japanese opposed to our activities in Vietnam, that we were well aware of it on
                    a daily basis. The Government, however, did everything it could to solve our
                    problems and to support our position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have talked a little about the Navy's role in the
                        Okinawa reversion process. How in general was the US military-Embassy
                        relationship in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Alexis Johnson, when he became Ambassador, had established a position
                    for a Political-Military Affairs Counselor, primarily to accommodate some
                    conflicting personalities in the Embassy although I think that Johnson liked the
                    idea anyway. He had done the same thing when he was Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. He had set up a Pol-Mil staff in his own office. The position
                    of Political-Military Counselor was first filled by Scott George. That cut the
                    Political Section out of direct involvement in negotiations and liaison with the
                    military. The military-civilian relationships were conducted primarily through a
                    series of committees that included Embassy, US military and the Japanese
                    government, both civilian and military. Scott was replaced by Howard Meyers.
                    Sneider, who was a Political-Military specialist, kept a close eye on
                    political-military matters. The Ambassador was also involved though his contacts
                    with the US Commanders in Chief of the Air Force and USFJ and with the CINC in
                    Okinawa. When I arrived in 1970, the Embassy still had a Political-Military
                    Counselor. When in 1972, the Okinawa reversion process had been successfully
                    concluded, I recommended that the Embassy return to a more normal organization
                    with the political-military work being integrated within the Political Section.
                    There wasn't a separate section in Germany or in Italy and I didn't understand
                    why, after reversion, there needed to be one in Japan. Howard Meyers had left by
                    this time; Chuck Schmitz, who had been the chief lawyer working for Dick Sneider
                    on reversion, followed Howard as the man in charge of the Pol-Military Affairs
                    office. On paper, that section was part of the Political Section. Sneider had
                    left to be followed by Tom Shoesmith. I insisted that the Political Counselor be
                    responsible for political-military affairs and so it was done. It had worked
                    that way ever since and very smoothly at that.</p>
                <p>Our contact with the US military was on a daily basis, by phone, if not
                    personally. The military rarely met alone with Japanese civilians in the
                    National Defense Agency. There were of course a lot of daily contacts on a
                    military-to-military contacts, but normally, if there were any discussions with
                    the defense Agency, the Embassy participated. As I said, much of the work was
                    done in committees, particularly the Joint Committee, which consisted of
                    representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the Embassy and the
                    military of both countries. There we discussed issues arising under the
                    Administrative Agreement, the Okinawa Reversion Agreement and other important
                    matters. My main contact was usually the Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air
                    Force; the CINC dealt with the Ambassador. Our relationships were generally
                    productive and congenial. The only problem that I can recall was that
                    encountered by Tom Shoesmith when he first arrived; he didn't see eye-to-eye
                    with the general in charge of the military facility at Zama, who was also the
                    same person responsible for the transportation of tanks and heavy equipment to
                    the docks in Yokohama. The General wanted to take a strong stand and demand US
                    “rights” to the freedom of transportation of equipment throughout Japan;
                    Shoesmith was counseling restraint. Tom was sure that a peaceful resolution
                    could be found given enough time; the General was not willing to brook any
                    delay. He just wanted to bull his way through the streets of Yokohama.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>So periodically, there were differences between the US military and civilian
                    arms. The military were much more inclined to pound tables and demand, even
                    knowing Japanese reluctance to raise politically sensitive issues. But on the
                    whole, the cooperation was good and there was no competition. Most of the issues
                    that we discussed were related to the status of US forces. There were always
                    problems about some incident or another caused by a GI—minor incidents of cab
                    drivers bring robbed by a drunken GI, or some incident related to prostitutes.
                    They were relatively infrequent and were handled at lower command levels. The
                    more serious problems involved the question of administrative cost sharing, such
                    as would arise whenever new housing was constructed. Also there would be
                    questions about utility cost-sharing and the wage scales for local employees.
                    Periodically, the citizens living around a base would complain about the noise
                    made by airplanes landing and taking off, particularly during night exercises or
                    about airplane interference with their TV reception or destruction of property
                    during some military exercise. Many of these problems arose in Okinawa because
                    our presence was so much greater there than in other parts of Japan and because
                    Okinawa was used often for military exercises. We had some exercises in
                    Hokkaido, but most of them occurred in Okinawa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major political issues that you had to
                        confront during the three years you were in Tokyo as Political
                        Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: There was a considerable amount of disarray in the Japanese government
                    after Sato's resignation and his replacement by Tanaka. Tanaka was a
                    controversial figure whose ascendancy to power was a stormy affair. That turn of
                    events created considerable amount of reporting and analysis by the Embassy. The
                    one-party system had been entrenched in Japan for many, many years, but it must
                    be understood that the”one-party” label that Americans have applied to the
                    Japanese political system is very misleading. The “one-party” label masked a
                    number of competing factions, which made for vigorous competition in the
                    political process. We had to follow closely what was happening in each
                    faction.</p>
                <p>The Socialists were viewed as a much less of a menace than they had been in the
                    '50s and '60s. They were not pro-American by any means, particularly when it
                    came to the Vietnam war. Of course, they had a lot of support from
                    non-Socialists on that issue and we had to devote a lot of public relations
                    effort to explain the US position on the war. As I mentioned before, the
                    students especially had a field day with that issue. They not only demonstrated
                    frequently, but sometimes would barricade their campuses, effectively closing
                    them down. One day, an American plane ran into a tower on the campus of Fukuoka
                    University. The plane was held captive by the students as a symbol of American
                    war making. The campus was closed for many weeks. There were some Americans—e.g.
                    a Buddhist priest named Brian Victoria—in the anti-war movement; he used to go
                    on hunger strikes in front of the Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Economic tensions between the United States and Japan were just beginning. We
                    noticed a marked increase in exports to the US, particularly TV sets and
                    automobiles. Textiles had always been a problem. Ambassador Meyer took great
                    interest in this trade issue, in part because textiles were such an important
                    part of Nixon's “Southern strategy”. This southern coalition was instrumental in
                    Nixon's election; many represented states with major textile production
                    facilities and workers, who feared the large imports of Japanese textiles.
                    Finally, marathon negotiations were started which ended in a multi-fiber
                    agreement, which cut back on Japanese exports. The US side was headed by
                    Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy. He set up his offices in the Okura Hotel, and
                    he worked from there. The Japanese resented the U.S. pressure and the resulting
                    agreement. That is not unusual; in general, most of the negotiations end up in
                    resentment on both sides. We also worried about citrus—particularly
                    grapefruit—imports into Japan, which continued to be a problem for many years,
                    although the issue has disappeared by now. The Japanese were limiting imports of
                    citrus fruits because it competed with its own domestic production; they feared
                    that imports would wipe out their own industry. So the early '70s saw the
                    beginning of the trade frictions and the burgeoning of the trade deficits. We
                    were worrying then about a potential imbalance of $10 billion. We have of course
                    long surpassed that!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your main contacts in the Japanese
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: Our main point of contact was the Foreign Ministry, where we had access
                    to any official. We didn't have to go through the North American Bureau to talk
                    to officials in the Foreign Ministry, unless for example the Ambassador wanted
                    an appointment with the Foreign Minister. We made our own appointments in other
                    parts of the Japanese government, like MITI or the Ministry of Finance. Our
                    contacts with the Japanese bureaucracy were daily. Then, as it is today, the
                    Japanese bureaucracy was in control of Japanese policy. It had more power than
                    the politicians, as it still has today. The bureaucracy's continuing strength is
                    anchored in the Confucian social system. In ancient days, there were Mandarins;
                    these were experts with long years of experience in the daily workings of an
                    issue. The Japanese bureaucracy was viewed as the modern incarnation of the
                    Mandarins. Very recently, this view has changed, and the bureaucracy is under a
                    lot more critical attention but it is still very powerful. There was no question
                    that in the '70s, the bureaucracy was the dominant policy making element of the
                    government. Sometimes, it could be stymied by determined political opposition
                    which could block necessary legislation or prevent it from being implemented,
                    but that occurred only rarely. The Liberal Democratic Party didn't always stand
                    united on every issue and therefore couldn't always dictate passage of every bit
                    of legislation. Also the Japanese political system almost requires that
                    legislation have some support from an opposition party. The so-called “tyranny
                    of the majority” was not acceptable in Japanese politics, except on very rare
                    occasions. The LDP would never ram legislation through the Diet without some
                    support from one of the minor opposition party. That was just not the Japanese
                    way —consensus was and is essential. That society lives by consensus and the
                    imposition of one view, even if held by a majority, is just not acceptable; some
                    representatives of the minority have to accede. That importance of consensus is
                    still vital in Japanese politics as it is in their personal lives. No argument
                    can be won by reference to “I have all the chips”; concessions have to be made
                    to minority views. It is a culture that Americans have a difficult time
                    understanding and dealing with. Unless you have lived with it for sometime, it
                    is very hard to understand it and deal with it. It was our job in the Embassy to
                    try to explain this culture to Washington; it was our job to explain to the
                    newcomers in the Embassy who might not have been familiar with it. It is
                    important to understand the Japanese culture if we are to be successful in
                    achieving our objectives; direct confrontation was and is just not likely to
                    elicit the right response. We had to explain this culture difference to visiting
                    Congressmen or any other American policy makers who were inclined to use the
                    direct American approach. Of course, this role placed us in awkward positions at
                    times; some Americans just viewed us as “apologists”. That is true still today.
                    There is the so-called “Chrysanthemum Club”, as the old “Japanese hands” are
                    known. We are the ones who are opposing the thunder of the American righteous
                    wrath about Japanese trade policies, for example, when all red-blooded Americans
                    are anxious to mount the ramparts and blast the Japanese for their “sins” in the
                    hopes of bludgeoning the Japanese into taking actions which they are not
                    prepared for. This cultural clash has been true throughout the history of
                    U.S.-Japanese relations. If you look at those relations even before the war when
                    Joseph Grew was our Ambassador in Tokyo you can see some indications of this
                    tension. To some degree, all Embassies have to wrestle with this problem of
                    interpreting their host society to the American policy makers, but I think that
                    our representatives in Tokyo bear a special burden in this area.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>The perception that the Embassy had “clientitis” existed in the early '70s. Meyer
                    did not want that perception to be perpetuated and he was tough on the Japanese
                    when it came to economic/trade issues. He was right; some of those transactions
                    should have been brought to the attention of Washington and were. The
                    mercantilism exhibited by the Japanese in those days was just unacceptable. All
                    of the Embassy agreed on that point. There were occasional efforts made to
                    explain to Washington that change in Japanese practices could only be made
                    through other means than direct confrontation. The debate was not about
                    objectives; it was about means.</p>
                <p>We also differed with Japan to a certain extent about China. They thought we were
                    much too confrontational with the Mainland. They felt that we would be more
                    influential if we were spoke a little more softly, thereby softening the
                    atmosphere which might permit the Chinese to be somewhat more accommodating.
                    That of course is exactly what took place in the Nixon/Kissinger regime starting
                    with the “China shock”. When the Kissinger visit became known in Tokyo, the
                    Japanese were astonished. The professionals were outraged that there had not
                    been any advance consultation, much less warning. They felt betrayed. Here was
                    the United States actively engaged in trying to keep the Chinese Communists from
                    taking a seat in the UN Security Council. We were conferring daily with the
                    Japanese on this issue both in New York and in Tokyo, stirring up support for
                    Taiwan. We had repeatedly promised that we would take no action with respect to
                    China without prior consultation. In the final analysis, we broke our word. The
                    Embassy knew absolutely nothing about Kissinger's trip to China; I think the
                    Japanese came to believe that fact, but at the time it happened, they probably
                    thought that someone in the Embassy must have known. It would have been
                    impossible in the Japanese system for anything like that to happen. Privately,
                    the Japanese felt that Kissinger had betrayed them, although they really had not
                    had much contact with him. He had never visited Japan and had never shown much
                    interest in the Far East. There was a general curiosity about the articulate
                    National Security Advisor, but he was not a target of Japanese attention in
                    Washington. The China trip changed all that; Kissinger got their attention!</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The “China shock” was quickly followed by the “dollar shock” and the “soybean
                    shock”. No one in the Embassy was very happy about those and I doubt that anyone
                    in the Bureau for Far Eastern Affairs in State was very happy. Marshall Green
                    was the Assistant Secretary at the time and he was totally surprised. The
                    Japanese found it very hard to accommodate themselves to these major lunges in
                    US policies. They all came as surprises to one degree or another and had no
                    history of consultation behind them. The American decision-making process is so
                    culturally different from that of the Japanese that the effects of policy
                    changes were greatly magnified just by the cultural differences. Everybody in
                    the Embassy was dismayed by the shift in our China policy. Many supported closer
                    relationships with Peking; indeed “ping-pong” diplomacy started in Tokyo. By
                    sheer accident, Bill Cunningham, who worked for me and who happened to be a
                    China expert, was walking out of the Embassy and overheard the Marine Guard at
                    the front desk talking on the phone telling a caller that he couldn't so
                    something or other. He heard enough of the conversation to raise his curiosity;
                    so he asked the Marine Guard what the conversation was all about. It turned out
                    that an American ping-pong team coach was calling because he and his players had
                    been invited to go to China and wanted to know whether it would be all right.
                    Bill immediately cabled Washington about this invitation. We of course did not
                    know that Kissinger had been in contact with the Chinese and that this
                    invitation was part of a diplomatic dance that was on-going and that in fact was
                    a response to Kissinger's “feelers”. It was pure chance that the “ping-pong”
                    trip could have been scotched by a Marine Guard; also Armin Meyer was very
                    reluctant to have the Embassy recommend that the players be permitted to go to
                    China. Nevertheless, a reporting cable was sent which became one more step in
                    the “opening to China” process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Japanese Country Director when you were in
                        Tokyo and how were Embassy-Washington relationships in the early '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: The Country Director was Dick Ericson, who took that job after I had
                    succeeded him in Tokyo. We had generally good and productive relationships with
                    Washington. The key was the DCM's relationship with the Country Director. there
                    were nightly telephone calls between the two as well as other phone
                    conversations between Tokyo and Washington on specific issues. We were well
                    served by Washington. Our relationships with other agencies were also very good.
                    I certainly had no problems and I don't remember anyone else in the Embassy
                    having any serious issues with other agencies. A number of them of course worked
                    quite independently, such as Treasury. The Embassy, as a whole, was quite
                    effective in these days. After Ambassador Meyer left and after Bob Ingersoll
                    replaced him in the Spring, 1972, the Embassy worked on much more of an “even
                    keel”.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Ingersoll had just retired from Borg-Warner. He had no knowledge of Japan. He had
                    to go through an education process to which he took extremely well. He listened
                    carefully and absorbed ell. He was energetic. He saw his role as an American
                    businessman talking to Japanese businessmen. He did that often and extremely
                    well. He permitted us to continue our daily contacts with the Japanese
                    government without micro-managing them. We kept him informed, but he didn't
                    intervene on day-to-day matters. He was a good economist and knew and understood
                    trade both in theory and in practice since he had worked for Borg-Warner. I
                    thought he performed very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In March, 1973 you were assigned to the Office of
                        Personnel in Washington. How did you get so lucky?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: When it became time to leave Japan, there was no other appropriate
                    assignment immediately available. I had always enjoyed personnel work; I had
                    always thought that being a senior personnel career counselor would be
                    interesting. I let it be known that if a vacancy was to occur in that branch of
                    Personnel, I would be interested. And so it happened. Of course, my return to
                    Washington became a matter of urgency because the assignment season was
                    late-winter. So I left Mary Jane and our youngest child in Tokyo so that he
                    could finish school and I returned to Washington in March.</p>
                <p>By 1973, the responsibility for assignments had been placed in the Office of
                    Personnel. The office for Senior Personnel assignments consisted of three
                    officers—Tom Recknagel headed up that office reporting to Bob Brewster, who was
                    the Deputy Personnel Director who ran the assignment process for the Director
                    General. The two other officers split assignment responsibilities on a
                    geographic and functional basis. I handled East Asia, Latin America, the Bureau
                    for Economic Affairs and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. We tried to
                    find assignments for people below the Ambassadorial and DCM levels. An
                    ambassador still had the right to choose his own DCM, but was no longer able to
                    pick and chose any officers below that level. All senior assignments were made
                    by the Office of Personnel in consultation.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I thought the personnel system worked relatively well in those days. Essentially,
                    the assignments were appropriate for an officer's skills, ability and career.
                    The Bureaus' interests were generally protected, but then this was before the
                    Department went into the “bids for assignment” mode. We negotiated most
                    assignments with the Bureau and we frequently consulted with the officer under
                    consideration by telephone to his or her overseas post. We wanted to make sure
                    first of all that they ere aware of the possible opening and secondly that they
                    were reasonably satisfied with our intended assignment. We had the usual surplus
                    of senior personnel, but it was manageable with temporary assignments and
                    special tasks. The morale of the senior cadre was not too bad in the mid '70s.
                    Morale in the Foreign Service is never good, but it was certainly better than
                    that which exists today. The process was working relatively smoothly;
                    assignments were being made promptly and far enough in advance to permit some
                    planning on part of the officer and the post.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I spent part of my tour on sick leave recovering from a back
                    operation. By mid-1974, Dick Sneider was nominated to be our Ambassador in Korea
                    and he took Dick Ericson with him to be his DCM. That left vacant the job of
                    Japan Country Director. I was the only person immediately available who had had
                    experience in that part of the world. So that shortened my tour in Personnel,
                    but I looked forward to working the Japan desk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Bureau for East Asian Affairs like in
                        1974?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I reported for duty just around the time when Bob Ingersoll returned
                    from Tokyo to become the Assistant Secretary. Ingersoll had been appointed when
                    Mac Godley could not win confirmation because of his alleged involvement in the
                    Laos fiasco. Kissinger had just moved from the White House to his offices on the
                    Seventh Floor. Ingersoll only stayed for about six months before being promoted
                    to Deputy Secretary and was then followed by Phil Habib. Bob was the nicest
                    person, but he was really a neophyte in the Washington bureaucracy. He worked
                    hard at being Assistant secretary and had good policy sense. He was determined
                    to serve the Secretary as best be could, but I think he eventually found the
                    role of Deputy Secretary hard to accept because he found himself working on all
                    the issues that Kissinger didn't want to touch. That made him the Department's
                    front man on many sticky matters. Habib was replaced by Art Hummel in mid-76
                    when Phil became Under Secretary for Political Affairs. I spanned three
                    Assistant Secretaries. Habib was the most interesting one to work for. He was
                    the most exciting boss that I ever had.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>As Japan Country Director, I first reported to Dick Sneider, who was the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for a brief time before going to Korea in the summer of
                    1974. Then Owen Zurhellen succeeded Sneider. He lasted for less than a year
                    because he offended Kissinger in 1975 and was shipped out as Ambassador to
                    Suriname. Zurhellen ran into trouble when the Japanese Prime Minister was due
                    for a Washington visit. The event had not been publicly announced. The
                    President, Kissinger and a number of VIPs were scheduled to take a trip to
                    Europe, but it was not publicly known that the President was going to extend the
                    trip to Romania and perhaps to another country. In any case, no one knew for
                    sure when he would return to the United States. I brought the Japanese
                    Ambassador to see Kissinger before his departure on this European trip. The
                    Ambassador wished him well and said that he hoped that all was set for the Prime
                    Minister's visit. Kissinger asked in his usual elliptical fashion: “Mr.
                    Ambassador, would a postponement of a couple of days make a great deal of
                    difference to the Prime Minister?” The Ambassador thought that was manageable as
                    long as the visit dates had not been publicly announced. Once the visit was
                    public and so announced to the Diet, it could not be changed; that would create
                    a disastrous P.R. problem. The President and his entourage went off to Europe
                    and the plans for the Prime Minister's visit proceeded. When it became apparent
                    that the President would not return on his previously announced schedule,
                    Zurhellen, then acting Assistant Secretary in Habib's absence—he was out of the
                    country—told us to keep sending telegrams to the Secretary asking about when the
                    Japanese Prime Minister might be welcomed. We told the Secretary that the
                    announcement would be made soon; each cable had a stronger note of urgency
                    because we knew that the Japanese might announce the visit at any time. We kept
                    asking for guidance because if the dates were not satisfactory, we would have to
                    tell the Japanese immediately, if not sooner. We spelled out the consequences;
                    i.e. once the dates are announced, there could be no changes. Cable after cable
                    went unanswered; we got nothing but silence back from Kissinger. No guidance at
                    all. The Japanese schedule was announced in the Diet. The President and
                    Kissinger returned one night; the next morning the Japanese Prime Minister
                    arrived at ten o'clock.. By this time, Habib had returned and he and I and
                    Zurhellen were summoned see Kissinger for a briefing. Habib was asked to step
                    into the office alone. I was later told that the Secretary gave him holy hell;
                    then he called Zurhellen and me into the office and yelled and screamed at us.
                    He asked how we could have let such a thing happen. The President and his staff
                    had just returned from a long trip; they were exhausted. They couldn't possibly
                    receive the Prime Minister and his delegation. He really raved and ranted;
                    Zurhellen tried to explain that we had sent cable after cable asking for
                    guidance. Henry would not be placated; he just thought that we had failed
                    miserably and completely. The Prime Minister's visit came and went, as did
                    Zurhellen soon thereafter. We never found out what happened to our cables. It
                    would be tempting to think that the staff screwed up since the volume of traffic
                    to the Secretary was always very high when he traveled, but I think it is more
                    likely that Kissinger just wanted to wait; he was well aware of the matter and
                    decided for whatever reason not to pay any attention. I am sure that he could
                    have found a few minutes to give us some guidance; he was tireless and always on
                    the go. But he didn't choose to do so and until today I don't know how and why
                    the whole mess developed.Then Oscar Armstrong became the DAS for a while; he was
                    followed by Bill Gleysteen who stayed there until he became Ambassador to Korea
                    in 1978.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that the concept of Country Director was born during
                    Crockett's regime. By the time I became Japan Country Director, the theory had
                    become well entrenched in practice. I had wide ranging authority to monitor and
                    direct most of the activities that took place in and with Japan. The China
                    Country Director operated in a similar fashion. Both of the occupants of that
                    position had a lot of credibility within the Department and within the U.S.
                    government. In fact, I think the whole Bureau operated as envisioned by Crockett
                    and others. Both within the Department and the U.S. government, East Asian
                    country directors were viewed as linchpins of policy making and implementation.
                    Scott George was then the German Affairs Country Director. We would often say
                    that we had the best jobs in the Department; the problems and issues for both of
                    us were major and of course we handled matters that pertained to two of the most
                    important countries in the world. I would not say the same thing for all other
                    parts of the Department.</p>
                <p>Phil Habib gave me a lot of leeway. Once he came to know me, he relied on my
                    advice and provided a lot of support. Phil would be quick to run with the ball
                    if he thought he could do it better than anyone else; he thought that most of
                    the time. But once he was convinced that you could do a satisfactory job for
                    him, he tended to keep supervision at a minimum. I had a very good relationship
                    with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Phil's trademark was to appear to be enraged by anything that was going on at the
                    moment. He would always find fault with what was done; he never seemed
                    satisfied. He would bluster and shout, particularly with Dan O'Donohue, at every
                    staff meeting. Dan was the Korea Country Director. Dick Sneider used to refer to
                    himself as the “Charge for Korean Affairs” because Phil always tried to
                    micro-manage Korean programs. Actually, Phil and Dan were very close, and Phil
                    helped Dan in his career on many occasions. But you had to understand Phil's
                    modus operandi; otherwise you would be overwhelmed and respond in exactly the
                    wrong way and be left in utter oblivion. I did not know Habib before he came to
                    the Bureau, but I quickly adapted to this boisterous exterior. He would ask a
                    few questions out of the corner of his mouth and then he would grumble some
                    instructions. He always had some gracious comment at the end to the effect that
                    he could have done the job better and quicker himself. If you understood him,
                    you didn't take pay any attention to these rumblings. Indeed, I think I
                    developed very close relationship with Phil Habib. He started out being
                    suspicious of Japan and of Japan experts, but that didn't last very long. Soon,
                    as I said, he came to trust my work and judgement and I found him to be a most
                    inventive and persuasive leader. He was always ready to take up your cudgel if
                    that were necessary. At one point, during the Miki visit, the Prime Minister
                    wanted to modify slightly the security relationship between the United States
                    and Japan. He was seeking some minor change in the Far East security clause of
                    the 1960 US-Japan Treaty. Miki just wanted to move Japan slightly away from the
                    responsibility it had under the security treaty for considering a threat to the
                    security of the Korean peninsula as a threat to the security of Japan.. He
                    didn't quite know how to go about doing it. Kiki Kuriyama, then the Political
                    Counselor at the Japanese Embassy and I spent days finding an acceptable
                    formulation for this relatively minor change. We finally agreed on a statement
                    that said that the security of Korea was essential to the security of the Far
                    East, which seemed to satisfy Miki as being sufficiently different. None of the
                    rest of us saw it as a change of existing policy or formulations, but it
                    appeared to satisfy Miki's domestic political requirements to present himself as
                    somewhat more independent of the United States than had been the case with his
                    predecessors. After we finally had come up with satisfactory language, we had to
                    get Kissinger's approval. It was one of those days when no one could get to the
                    Secretary through established channels. That evening, at a small White House
                    working dinner, hosted by Ford, to which, much to my surprise I was invited, I
                    carried with me the text and sat on it during the meal). This had been worked
                    out in advance. As we left the table—there were about thirty guests—Habib took
                    the paper and grabbed Kissinger and briefed him on the change. The Secretary
                    looked at it and grumbled and said “okay”, but only if the Japanese would
                    publicly state that US-Japan relations had never been better. That was an easy
                    task and so we wrapped it up. But it was an interesting illustration how
                    diplomacy sometimes is conducted.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Habib was loyal to his troops almost to a fault. He could yell at
                    us, but he would not permit anyone else to do so. No one, but no one, could
                    criticize his “boys and girls”. He was probably more adapt at handling Kissinger
                    than any other Assistant Secretary in the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The relationship with Habib in addition to the policy challenges, made the Japan
                    job an exciting one. It kept me on my toes all the time partly because I worked
                    for a capricious and unpredictable Secretary of State who would become involved
                    in problems and then just as quickly become disengaged. Fortunately, he did not
                    involve himself in Japanese affairs very often—he had more urgent matters to
                    attend to. But every once in a while, Japan would come up on his screen and then
                    we would have to find ways of satisfying him. Usually, the matters that he
                    became involved in were very petty. He was always trying to recover his status
                    in Japan which had plummeted after the “China shock”. He tended to dismiss
                    Japanese sensitivity to having been ignored on the China initiative. He used to
                    defend himself by saying that information leaked out of Japan faster than any
                    other place in the world and therefore it would have been too risky to share his
                    plans with the Japanese. Any time his name appeared in the Japanese media,
                    Kissinger seemed to find out about it. If the story was even remotely viewed as
                    critical, he would call Habib and ask for an explanation. He always felt
                    aggrieved by these stories and always wanted them stopped. That is an
                    illustration of the matters in which Kissinger became involved. He stopped in
                    Japan on several occasions and he saw Japanese Prime Ministers and Foreign
                    Ministers in Washington on a number of occasions. The first visit, which came
                    shortly after the new Administration was inaugurated, was scheduled after Prime
                    Minister Miki through his son who was a student in Washington inquired whether
                    he could make contact with the new team. The son went to see Jim Wickel who was
                    the Department's official Japanese translator and worked for me in The Office of
                    Japanese Affairs. Miki said that his father wanted to have this contact, but
                    found it difficult to initiate it. He would however send Miyazawa then the
                    Foreign Minister, to meet with Kissinger secretly. When we informed Kissinger of
                    Miki's plans, he was delighted because he loved to operate in this fashion —
                    that is hidden from public view. But Miyazawa dawdled around and didn't schedule
                    any meeting. He instead wrote a letter asking whether he and Kissinger couldn't
                    get together at some international meeting that might take place in the near
                    future. That of course didn't please Kissinger at all; he thought he was being
                    led around by some upstart who didn't understand how to conduct international
                    diplomacy. So when the Foreign Minister finally did arrive, he was scheduled to
                    meet Kissinger at 10:00 a.m. He arrived punctually at the scheduled time only to
                    find that Kissinger was at the White House (where he was writing his annual
                    “State of the World” report). So Bob Ingersoll received the Foreign Minister and
                    hosted a lunch for him. The Japanese reporters were very upset by what they
                    perceived to be a major insult and breach of protocol. Finally, Habib and
                    Eagleburger prevailed on Kissinger to return to the Department. So toward the
                    end of the meal, in sweeps Kissinger, full of apologies and contrition.
                    Miyazawa, who spoke excellent English, was able to make few well chosen points,
                    but at the end, all was smoothed over. Kissinger said that he had “to return to
                    the White House to translate his report from German.”, but that he would host
                    another lunch for the Foreign Minister the next day. Luckily this could be told
                    to the Japanese reporters before their deadline and nobody reported that their
                    Foreign Minister had been snubbed. It ended well, but for a while, the
                    atmosphere was very tense and we were on edge of a precipice. If Kissinger had
                    not arrived when he did, the reports back to Japan would have been very harsh
                    indeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>We spent sometime worrying about trade, although those issues had not risen to
                    the decibel level of the last ten years. The trade imbalance was probably on the
                    order of $7-8 billion at the time, which seemed huge in those days, but was not
                    close to the today's level. There were people in our government—Commerce and
                    Treasury—who were concerned with the imbalance. There was some interest shown by
                    Congress, but little on the part of private industry. The list of commodities
                    under scrutiny were the standard ones: textiles, citrus, automobiles, television
                    sets. The pressure to do something about the deficit was just beginning to
                    build, but it was not yet the major preoccupation.</p>
                <p>We focused primarily on security issues. We worried about Japanese contributions
                    to the support of our forces in Japan and the self-imposed Japanese budget
                    limitation of 1% of GNP for defense expenditures. DoD was pressing us to take a
                    stronger position on this defense expenditures issue; they wanted the Japanese
                    to spend more. We did in fact pressure the Japanese on this questions through
                    the Ford and Carter administrations, but it was essentially an unproductive
                    initiative. The Japanese did not take kindly to us telling them they had to
                    spend X percentage of GNP on defense. The Reagan administration, in addressing
                    the problem, talked in different terms. I think this primarily due to the
                    influence of Rich Armitage. The US in the '80's did not talk about levels or
                    amounts of expenditures, but rather discussed the issues in terms of roles and
                    missions that Japan had agreed to undertake after joint consultations. We then
                    said that sufficient amounts had to be spent to conduct those roles and missions
                    without ever specifying exact levels of expenditures. That put the issue in a
                    much more acceptable framework for the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that comment suggest that the other parts of the US
                        bureaucracy had little understanding of Japanese culture and modus
                        vivendi?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: I think that was true. It is the standard complaint of the expert. Japan
                    is different from a Western country and even from other Asian countries. That
                    fact requires that a lot of education be provided for those in the US government
                    who are not familiar with Japanese customs and mores. We spent some time
                    explaining Japanese perspectives and motivations for their behavior. That
                    doesn't mean that we should not try once in a while to change their behavior or
                    their policies, nor should any one in the US government take on the role of
                    apologist for the Japanese. But if you want behavior modification, you have to
                    understand how that can be done in the Japanese framework. US goals can be
                    achieved with a minimum of bruised feelings if approached in manner acceptable
                    to Japanese society. It has been done and continues to be done in certain
                    instances. The most effective way to change Japanese behavior is to identify
                    common points of interest rather than the points of disagreement. Japanese do no
                    respond well to a confrontational style of negotiations. They do respond to
                    consensus and compromise which is carefully worked out. It is important for
                    negotiators to insure that “face” is not lost on the part of either side. Too
                    often these important, and sometimes vital, aspects of negotiating with the
                    Japanese are ignored by Americans, who view using these tactics as “coddling of
                    the Japanese” who, they feel, are smart enough to do things the American way.
                    There are easier, better and probably more successful ways of negotiating with
                    the Japanese than the tactics we use today and did in the '70s as well. There is
                    always someone in the US bureaucracy who wants to bull his or her way through
                    the “Japan shop”. That perhaps is an appropriate tactic if all else has failed;
                    sometimes the “shock” approach is the only one that will work, but we must
                    recognize that every time we use the direct and forceful approach, we pay a
                    price. I was very fortunate that Habib particularly understood that question; if
                    he didn't, he trusted that I did. Both Habib and Hummel relied on the advice of
                    their country directors and that made for a smooth working operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>My relationships with the Pentagon were good, in general. I worked primarily with
                    ISA. For part of my tour, I worked with a War College classmate who was in ISA
                    handling Japanese matters. In the Department, we worked with the Bureau of
                    Politico-Military Affairs and that worked well. Of course, it helped that by the
                    time I had finished my tour as Country Director, I had lasted in that position
                    longer than any of my predecessors and I should add, longer than any of my
                    successors, even though it was only three and a half years. But that gave me a
                    familiarity with issues that many others did not have. I set a record which I
                    don't think has been broken to date. I don't think that length of service in a
                    particular position gives a State Department official an advantage in the
                    Washington bureaucratic in-fighting. I do think that State is at a disadvantage
                    in that arena because its officers serve overseas more than they do in
                    Washington. Washington is a unique environment that requires some familiarity
                    with its processes. Bureaucratic in-fighting is a skill that Foreign Service
                    officers either do not have or do not cultivate and therefore that puts them at
                    some disadvantage in the Washington environment. The State Department officials
                    who navigate well in Washington are often the civil servants who do not serve
                    overseas, but are in Washington all the time. It is the constant rotation
                    between Washington and overseas that puts a Foreign Service Officer at some
                    disadvantage when he works in Washington. We don't know where the power lies
                    either within the Department or in other agencies. And we don't have the
                    opportunity to build up the personal relationships which the civil servants
                    develop over decades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other agencies were you in close contact during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: In those days, the NSC was in tight control of inter-agency contacts.
                    They supervised inter-agency work closely to insure proper coordination and
                    control. This was the period when Kissinger was both Secretary of State and
                    National Security Advisor. That “dual hatted” role did not affect us in our
                    daily work. The Seventh Floor and the NSC had their own channel of
                    communications so that both staffs were fully apprized on current matters. So we
                    didn't have to worry about keeping both staffs apprized; their coordination was
                    very good. The Seventh Floor was, as far as we were concerned, Kissinger and his
                    close collaborators. Despite the fact that Ingersoll was the Deputy Secretary,
                    he had little, if any involvement in Japanese affairs. the same thing happened
                    when Habib became Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Even he didn't get
                    involved in Japanese matters. We had semi-annual planning talks with the
                    Japanese, which were led on our side by the Policy Planning staff. The Japanese
                    delegation was headed by their Foreign Ministry's Office of Research and
                    Intelligence. Win Lord—the Director of the Policy Planning Staff—, Sam Lewis—his
                    deputy—and I would go to Japan for the meetings, most of which were held in
                    remote locations to minimize outside distractions. We would talk about world
                    problems and try to coordinate where we could our policies. Then six months
                    later, the Japanese would come to the US and we would continue our discussions.
                    The focus of these talks were global issues, to US-Japan relations. I thought
                    that these exchanges were useful; Win Lord seemed to enjoy them as had his
                    predecessors. They helped maintain close relations with the Japanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>We also had separate discussions on China and the Middle East, although Japan's
                    involvement in that part of the world was very limited and didn't grow until
                    later. The Japanese participated fully in these discussions; the issues were of
                    interest to them. They did not however try to stake out independent policy
                    positions; they were primarily interested in being brought up to date on our
                    views. They tried to support us as productively as possible on our positions. In
                    those days, the key goal of Japanese foreign policy was to maintain close
                    relationships with the United States and to support us to the best of their
                    abilities in our global goals. We agreed that the Japanese basic policy was
                    correct; we did not try to push them to be more active. We were very mindful of
                    the limitations imposed on the Japanese by their Constitution and did not try to
                    urge them beyond the limits of foreign policy activity that they had decided on.
                    Their Constitution prohibited military alliances outside of the United Nations
                    and limited Japanese participation in military strategic planning. At the time,
                    we did not see Japan as a possible surrogate for our policy in any parts of the
                    world. We did believe that Japan could play a constructive role in the area
                    surrounding that country. We thought Japan could be a stabilizing force,
                    particularly in the economic field and especially in Southeast Asia. We didn't
                    expect much, if any, political leadership from Japan because neither we or the
                    Japanese could foretell what the reaction of other Asian countries might be if
                    the Japanese were to try to bring any massive political influence to bear. The
                    scars of World War II were still too fresh in Asia to expect any of those
                    countries to follow the Japanese on political issues. The Japanese would have
                    been willing to play a constructive role, but were not about rush in where they
                    might not be wanted and we were certainly not going to push them faster than
                    they wanted to go, in the mid-70s, at least.</p>
                <p>We thought that the Japanese could still play a constructive role on China in
                    this period. It was still early in our relationships with mainland China, we had
                    just be re-initiated only a few years earlier. The Japanese, by now, had more or
                    less gotten over the “China shock” and they were anxious to support as much as
                    they could our opening to China. They followed our lead; they would not stake
                    out an independent path, but they did give us full support as an independent
                    nation dealing with China. We thought that the Japanese could be very helpful in
                    assisting China's economic development. There were several large projects, like
                    the Chumen oil fields, which the Japanese supported.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Once the Shanghai communique had been issued, we did not believe that the
                    Mainland-Taiwan issue was any longer a major impediment to Far East stability.
                    We essentially viewed those tensions as resolved by the communique. Essentially,
                    we did not see the United States having a policy in the Far East independent of
                    the over-all Cold War strategy that governed all of our foreign policy
                    strategies. In the Far East, was well as in all other parts of the world, all
                    major issues were viewed through the Cold War prism. For example, we viewed
                    Japan as a logistic and intelligence base for our confrontation with the Soviet
                    Union—the “unsinkable” aircraft carrier—300 miles away from the Pacific end of
                    the USSR. Japan provided a base for air coverage of the eastern portion of the
                    Soviet Union, if that became necessary. Our bases in Japan were well located to
                    provide a very potent strategic arm which would, while forward bases for our
                    defense, could at the same time be a vital component of Japan's defense. Our
                    problem was to manage this defense concept in a political manner acceptable to
                    them so that it would not infringe on their strict constitutional limitations on
                    military actions. The government undoubtedly understood that it was part of our
                    “containment policy”, but it had to be careful in its explanation to its
                    citizens of its defense expenditures and policies. The political opposition
                    stood firm in its strict interpretation of the Constitution which prohibited
                    Japan to be involved in any military operations except self-defense.</p>
                <p>The NSC official for Japanese affairs was Dick Smyser, a Foreign Service Officer.
                    He had responsibility for all Far East issues. He was an expert on Vietnam
                    having worked with Kissinger in this issue for sometime. He and I talked almost
                    every day. Whenever the NSC wanted to reach a policy decision or adjudicate a
                    inter-agency dispute, it would issue a NSSM. The bureaucracy would crank one up
                    and then a Presidential decision would be made.</p>
                <p>We kept in close touch with the intelligence community and Defense Department.
                    The intelligence community served us well and was quite responsive to our
                    needs.</p>
                <p>There wasn't enough Congressional interest in this period on Japanese affairs to
                    require me or any of my staff to spend much time with Members of Congress or
                    staffers. If there were any hearings, they were handled by the Assistant
                    Secretary or sometime by the Deputy Assistant Secretary. I remember that I
                    briefed one Congressman one time; he was the chairman of the Far East
                    subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Soon after that, he was
                    moved to another subcommittee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to just briefly return to the question of the
                        Japanese bureaucracy. Did you have any difficulty dealing with that
                        bureaucracy in the 1974-77 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: No. The Japanese bureaucracy was, by and large, essential to the
                    operations of the Japanese government. It was more important to work with the
                    bureaucracy than it was to work with the politicians. Regardless of what might
                    have been said about it, I think the Japanese bureaucracy is still the largest
                    single collection of well-trained and idealistic—in their own terms—people in
                    Japan. They feel that they have a mandate to get a job done and they get it
                    done, most of time well and in a timely fashion—according to their clocks. I
                    dealt again primarily with the Foreign Ministry, although I also had contacts
                    with MITI and the Finance Ministry. Later on, when assigned to Tokyo, I also
                    became acquainted with other Ministries, such as Postal and
                    Telecommunications—whichhas been causing so much trouble on the current Motorola
                    issue—, and the Health and Welfare Ministry—on import of medical equipment, and
                    the Justice Ministry—on American lawyers practicing in Japan. Those Ministries
                    are much more narrowly focused and domestically-oriented. They have little
                    knowledge, and perhaps even interest, in international affairs and therefore are
                    much more difficult to deal with, unlike their sophisticated counterparts in the
                    Foreign Ministry and MITI. In the '74-77 period, these American investment and
                    export issues were just beginning to emerge; they of course became serious bones
                    of contention in later years.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>This period between 1974 and 1977 was very active. The Japanese Emperor paid his
                    first visit to the United States. It was of course purely ceremonial and
                    strictly governed by protocol. The Emperor had done a little travel outside his
                    country, but not much. So the Japanese required strict conformance to their
                    practices, not for security reasons, but just because that was protocol. They
                    were greatly concerned that the royal institution not be minimized in any way.
                    Practically, the whole Imperial Household Agency was in the US at one time or
                    another checking on this or that detail. For example, the Emperor was scheduled
                    to visit Shea Stadium to see a football game—baseball season had unfortunately
                    passed by the time he visited. The Japanese called Angier Biddle Duke's office
                    in New York—he was then the city's Chief of Protocol—wanting to find out how
                    many times a visitor had been booed at the Stadium. They were assured that it
                    would not happen to the Emperor and it didn't. The visit went very well; in
                    fact, as the Emperor was leaving, just before the game concluded, some fan
                    raised his beer cup and said: “Thanks for coming, Emp!.” The Japanese also
                    insisted vigorously that the Emperor would not have his picture taken except
                    with another chief of state or that he would not sign any guest books. Of
                    course, in the final analysis, the Emperor had his picture taken with everybody
                    from the President to Mickey Mouse. He signed every guest book that was put in
                    front of him, signing “Hirohito” in laborious Japanese script. He was very human
                    and warm and the trip and the pictures that came form it did wonders for his
                    image in Japan. The Japanese had never seen that side of their Emperor's
                    personality, and they liked it. It was a typical case of staff over-protection.
                    He had a marvelous visit. We were deeply involved in the trip's plans down to
                    the last detail. It took months. I was supposed to accompany the Emperor during
                    his U.S. stay, but unfortunately my mother died at the time and I had to send a
                    substitute. She died slowly over a six-weeks period and I wrote a note to Phil
                    Habib saying that I couldn't devote full time to the Emperor's trip. I suggested
                    that he bring someone else to the desk to take over my responsibilities. Habib
                    called me immediately after he had read my note, saying that I should not worry
                    about the visit and that arrangements would proceed as planned. They did and the
                    visit was a great success. The Emperor very kindly gave me a gift: a box which I
                    still have and an autographed picture of him and his Empress.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Mike Mansfield had been selected to become our new Ambassador to Japan.
                    I don't know exactly how the selection was made. I had known Mansfield, although
                    not well. During my first Foreign Service Officer assignment, I worked with
                    Congressman Mansfield when he was part of the US Delegation to the UN General
                    Assembly. Later, while I was assigned to Rome, he came for the coronation of
                    Paul VI and as I explained earlier, I was the control officer for that
                    delegation. I escorted him and Maureen Mansfield around at the time for three or
                    four days, along with Earl Warren, Rabbi Lewis Finkelstein, Charles Englehardt
                    and others.</p>

                <p>Of course in 1976, there was an election in the US won by Jimmy Carter. Within
                    ten days of his inauguration, Carter sent Mondale to Tokyo for discussions with
                    the Japanese. In the meantime, Dick Holbrooke had been named as Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. So Japan was high on the foreign
                    policy agenda of the new administration and that kept us hopping during the
                    first half of 1977. In the Spring of that year, the new Ambassador had been
                    selected and the DCM selection process begun. I was due for an overseas
                    assignment in any case and Holbrooke was in the process of restructuring the
                    whole Bureau to meet his own needs and desires. I was of course hoping that I
                    would be selected by Mansfield to be his DCM and I was very glad that he did so.
                    Before he made his selection, I escorted him around in all of his meetings
                    around Washington. I arranged all the meetings and went with him. So I got to
                    know Mansfield relatively well during his indoctrination period.</p>
                <p>Mansfield had traveled widely and therefore was familiar with the role of a U.S.
                    Ambassador. Hodgson had left Tokyo in February, 1977 so that the post had been
                    run by a Charge' Tom Shoesmith for several months. When Mansfield's appointment
                    became public, Hodgson flew to Washington to brief the Mansfields. on his
                    experiences. As far as Mansfield was concerned, he did what he had always done:
                    consider he question carefully, reach a decision on what was right and then do
                    it. He never had a problem engaging the Japanese; he was just a very skilled
                    leader who knew how to approach issues and get them resolved if he could.
                    Mansfield did not see himself as a manager of a US establishment; he viewed
                    himself as a symbol of the American presence in Japan. He was the President's
                    personal representative and felt responsible for the image of America in Japan.
                    He was at first very reluctant to be a highly visible Ambassador; he wanted to
                    limit his public appearances to no more than two or three per annum. His initial
                    inclination was to view his assignment as a semi-retirement. That of course,
                    changed rapidly once he became ensconced in Tokyo. He communicated frequently
                    with the media, both American and Japanese. He did like to meet with
                    individuals, often early in the morning. He was always polite and attended even
                    routine ceremonial functions because he was the Ambassador, even when he
                    personally would have preferred to do something else. He became famous for his
                    ability to walk in the front door of a National Day reception, shake a few
                    hands, often have his picture taken and be gone in a few minutes. He moved into
                    an active role very slowly and somewhat reluctantly. He acted very much like
                    David Bruce did in London. Bruce met with the Queen and the Prime Minister and
                    perhaps a few key Cabinet officers, but never with lower officials. Of course,
                    the way Mansfield decided to be an ambassador was very much a function of his
                    own personality. I don't think the role he defined was done consciously, but he
                    molded the Ambassadorial role to fit his own style and behavior.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Mansfield very rapidly established close ties to the Prime Minister and the
                    Foreign Minister. The Japanese held him in awe; he was by far the most important
                    American politician who had ever been appointed as Ambassador. They were
                    overjoyed by the appointment because it signified to them that the new US
                    administration held Japan in highest regards. While in Tokyo, Mansfield tried
                    very hard to maintain his contacts with the US Congress. He always said that he
                    had no ambition to return to Congress after his stint as Ambassador except
                    perhaps to escort a foreign Prime Minister. He used to say that he had enjoyed
                    his years in Congress, but that he would not return to serve. He did so when he
                    came back to Washington go to Congress just to discuss the “good old days”, but,
                    as I said, he would escort the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister whenever they
                    visited Washington. He was always right there whenever these key Japanese would
                    meet the Foreign Relations Committee or Senators or Congressmen. That was always
                    very helpful to the Japanese because Mansfield would be the “gate opener” and
                    would lend his prestige to their discussions with members of Congress.</p>
                <p>He would always host any Congressional members who might be in Tokyo. He would
                    personally brief them and would exchange views with them. He was always well
                    informed on trade statistics, for example. He could tell each Congressman
                    exactly what the trade between his or her State, in some cases even district,
                    with Japan was at the time. He never forgot a statistic. He always knew what was
                    important to these members of Congress; he had never forgotten the lessons he
                    had learned as Majority Leader. He was very skilled in handling Members of
                    Congress. He never used these occasions to ask for any Congressional action or
                    favor. He would present the case as he saw it and would then leave to his
                    audience to take whatever action it considered appropriate. I think that on a
                    couple of occasions, Dick Holbrooke asked Mansfield to take on a couple of
                    political assignments—lobbying. The issues had nothing to do with US-Japan
                    relations. Mansfield refused; he didn't even do any political work for the
                    Administration in his home state of Montana. After having left Congress, he
                    never used his ties or connections to do any political work of any kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>He never demanded that he be kept abreast of anything, except perhaps
                    occasionally on economic statistics. He may have asked the IRS representative to
                    help him with his income taxes, but he never demanded anything. He expected the
                    staff to let him know what it considered important. I made certain that he saw
                    every important substantive cable from the Embassy. He was always the first in
                    the office. The Marine Guard would give him the key to his office suite. He
                    would start the day by reading the newspapers. Because of his careful readings,
                    he was extraordinarily well informed on both American and Japanese current
                    events. I would get to the office around 7:30 a.m. and start my day by having a
                    cup of coffee with the Ambassador. Some days that session would last a few
                    minutes; some days it lasted two hours. Sometimes, he would reminisce about his
                    political life; sometimes he would want to discuss a Japanese political issue or
                    about mutual security affairs or about events of the day or the week or about
                    internal Embassy matters. I was never quite sure what the subject of the day's
                    conversation might be, although I always had an agenda that I wanted to cover
                    with him. Sometimes he would suggest some form of communication to be sent to
                    the Department—and he would usually say: “Make it strong, Bill”. Sometimes he
                    would ask for a personal message to the President or the Secretary to be drafted
                    for his signature. That insured that his views were always well known in
                    Washington on the major issues. As far as I remember, he never called the
                    President; he didn't feel he had to and in any case, he hated telephones. He
                    would see the President whenever he was in Washington, almost every time. Same
                    with Secretary of State; he rarely called Vance from Tokyo. Holbrooke would call
                    him from Washington and Mansfield would talk to him, although very reluctantly.
                    Sometimes, he would refuse to take the call; I would then get on the phone and
                    tell Holbrooke that the Ambassador didn't want to talk to him. Holbrooke could
                    barely believe his ears. I remember one day, while I was back in Washington for
                    consultation, Holbrooke called Mansfield because some private group—it may have
                    been the Council for Foreign Relations or something like that—were visiting
                    Tokyo and had not been invited for any kind of social occasion by anyone in the
                    Embassy. The members of this private group had expressed some dismay to
                    Holbrooke. Dick thought that Mansfield should make some kind of effort. He was
                    about to call the Ambassador when I intervened and suggested that he would be
                    wasting his time. Fortunately, Holbrooke thought better of it and didn't call.
                    He would not have received a very cordial reply from Tokyo! In addition to his
                    personal reluctance to host large receptions, you must remember that both
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Mansfield were children of the depression. They barely
                    scraped through their youths. Spending money came hard to them, particularly for
                    what appeared to be frivolous matters. We had a very hard time convincing
                    Maureen to spend money for representational purposes, even if were not her own.
                    She was a little more relaxed about spending the government's money, but there
                    was always a struggle about the size of a guest list for any function at the
                    residence. I tried to stay as far away from issues of that kind as I possibly
                    could. Some of Mansfield's predecessors—particularly Jim Hodgson, who was a
                    business man—had made the Residence available for what were social functions
                    sponsored either by Department of Commerce or Agriculture trade teams or even
                    American private business groups. These groups would either pay the costs
                    directly or reimburse the Embassy. Soon after the Mansfields' arrival, someone
                    called Mrs. Mansfield and told her that there would be a social occasion at the
                    Residence that evening and wanted to make sure that there would be sufficient
                    sustenance for the guests. Maureen was outraged by the call; after that, I
                    issued instructions that the Residence would not be available for that kind of
                    activity. I added that only the Ambassador could determine what events would
                    take place there, that he would be the sole host and that all costs would be
                    paid by the State Department's representational funds. If a commercially
                    oriented reception took place, it was because the Embassy deemed it to be
                    important, not because a company or trade group wanted to use the Embassy
                    property...</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I did a lot of drafting; sometimes I would assign the task to others. The
                    messages would be shown to the concerned principals in the Embassy so that we
                    would all be saying the same thing to the public. Mansfield almost never wrote
                    anything himself; he would approve our drafts or ask for certain changes to be
                    made. He of course saw all “first person” messages; sometimes I would show him
                    other messages that were being proposed by Embassy officers when I thought they
                    were important enough to have the Ambassador's approval. I was determined that
                    he would never be caught unaware on any major substantive issue. I was equally
                    determined that I would not play any games with him, as some other DCMs may have
                    done with their Ambassadors. I was not going to pursue any personal agenda and
                    present Mansfield with a fait accompli. The Embassy was his Mission and not
                    mine. I was there to help him and to marshall the resources of the Embassy to
                    support him. I think we made a good team. I think he was satisfied with my
                    performance and I was certainly delighted to work for him.</p>
                <p>My main task as DCM was to run the Embassy—in my fashion—and be its principal
                    point of contact with the Department in Washington. I was also responsible for
                    the operations of our other establishments in Japan whose Principal Officers
                    reported to me. We didn't have a Supervisory Consul General as was the case in
                    other countries. We had a Consul General in Tokyo, but he was only responsible
                    for the consular operations at the Embassy. Each Principal Officer submitted a
                    monthly report to me on their activities. I used to contact them by phone when
                    some one special would visit their district or when we needed something done. I
                    did a modest amount of traveling throughout Japan. I took a couple of trips to
                    Southeast Asia to compare notes with my counterparts there. Whenever there were
                    major changes in the Cabinet—a new Prime Minister or a new Foreign Minister—you
                    could always expect the newcomer to visit Washington sooner, rather than later.
                    The Ambassador always accompanied the Prime Ministers and I usually accompanied
                    a new Foreign Minister. I would represent the Embassy during the course of his
                    meetings with various Washington officials.</p>
                <p>We had our usual battles with Washington on the staffing of the Embassy. We had
                    more than 300 Americans representing all agencies. Of that number, only 100 or
                    so were from the State Department. There were 33 or 34 different agencies
                    represented in Tokyo, including such as the Bonneville Power Administration
                    which was buying generators in Japan. The Ambassador always felt that there were
                    too many official Americans in Tokyo; our presence was just too large. During
                    one of the many efforts to reduce overseas employment (called MODE this time),
                    which begun just as I arrived in Tokyo, the Embassy was certain it could do
                    something about reducing the American presence. That view was held despite the
                    failure of many similar previous efforts. This time, the Ambassador was
                    determined to do something.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>He was particularly upset by the Office of Naval Research which had a small staff
                    in Tokyo. No one was quite sure what they were doing; it something to do with
                    cooperative efforts with Japanese scientists. One member of the staff had taken
                    an official trip to China without any Embassy clearance or even notification. In
                    the late '70s our relationships with China were still sufficiently delicate that
                    we did not allow many US government officials to travel there for fear that it
                    might be misunderstood by the Chinese or that they might take some P.R.
                    advantage from such a trip. So Mansfield targeted the ONR office and was
                    convinced that it should be disbanded. That was the office that he would
                    eliminate. That got us into a battle royal with Washington. It took us two years
                    of constant cable traffic, arguing back and forth about these three or four
                    people. We enlisted the assistance of the Department, which, in matters of this
                    kind, was and is just useless. We had high ranking Navy officials coming to
                    Tokyo to review the situation. We took the issue up whenever we were in
                    Washington. In part, the bitterness of this issue was the consequence of a major
                    bureaucratic battle we had had with Foreign Office made several years earlier
                    during the Okinawa reversion period and the security treaty days when the ONR
                    office was opened. The Japanese viewed the office as an intelligence collection
                    operation and were very reluctant to allow it to open. ONR was an open liaison
                    operation and in the final analysis, the Japanese government gave us permission
                    to open it. But the scars were still showing in the late '70s. After two years,
                    ONR closed shop in the Embassy. It just moved to a military command doing the
                    same thing under a different sponsor. It was ridiculous! The Embassy wasted a
                    lot of time and effort and accomplished nothing.</p>
                <p>I might at this time mention my fight with the Inspection Corps. Within a month
                    of my arrival, a team of Inspectors came to take a look at our operations. The
                    chief inspector was Terry Arnold, an old Philippine hand. Sheldon Krys was his
                    deputy for this inspection. The confrontation between the Inspectors and the
                    Embassy started almost immediately. The team had gone to some constituent posts
                    first. In Sapporo, the Consulate had hired a local, but before he could report
                    for duty, the Inspection team recommended that his position be abolished. It was
                    much too late; all the paperwork had been done and the person was ready to
                    report for duty. The team had behaved in a very high-handed fashion and had left
                    a lot of bruised feelings in Sapporo. On their first day in Tokyo, Lea Anderson,
                    our Administrative Counselor, took the team on a tour of the Embassy. After
                    that, the team came to me and said that the Embassy was too big. I suggested
                    that they might wish to hold that comment until they were finished with the
                    inspection instead of starting with a conclusion. Their comment was not
                    addressed to me because I had just arrived and had had nothing to do with the
                    size of the Embassy. Nevertheless, the team kept coming back to this issue every
                    time we met; we were not entirely unsympathetic with the general view because
                    the Ambassador himself had reached the same conclusion. But we were irritated by
                    the team's knee-jerk reaction. Mansfield met with the team a couple of times in
                    very formal settings, like their first courtesy call and their final call during
                    which he listened to their oral report without comment. He didn't entertain them
                    or have a discussion with them.</p>

                <p>In any case, every time the team and I met, we had a disagreement about one thing
                    or another. For example, the team took exception to the long standing practice
                    of the Commissary selling to other foreign diplomats. It was a practice that had
                    been approved by the Japanese Foreign Office many, many years earlier. It was a
                    useful practice not only to develop good will in the diplomatic corps, but also
                    to generate funds for the Commissary and other non-governmental expenses. Part
                    of our profits from the commissary went into a world-wide pool used to assist
                    commissaries at smaller posts that needed financial support. Arnold and his
                    group took exception to the practice. That gave rise to a major dispute and
                    debate. I still remember discussing the subject with Arnold at the Marine Ball
                    toward the end of the inspection trying to shout over the blare of the band. I
                    found the whole inspection a total waste of time and money. The major
                    recommendation was about the size of the Embassy and the desirability of it
                    being reduced by 10%. The team wanted us to volunteer a reduction of our
                    personnel ceiling by that percentage. Of course, the team did not suggest where
                    the reduction should take place; that was to be left to us. Then their report
                    recommended that we cease commissary services to other foreign diplomats in
                    Tokyo. I really took umbrage at the whole inspection effort in our written
                    response to the report. Our response was so harsh that the Inspector General was
                    upset and felt offended. I thought it was a lousy inspection which wasted
                    everybody's time and lots of money. The Inspector General's office refereed the
                    issue of sales to the Legal Advisor who ruled that it was illegal for US
                    commissaries to sell to non-US diplomats. So, much to our embarrassment, we
                    ceased that practice. But we refused to accept the general recommendation on
                    personnel reductions on the grounds that no specific suggestions were put
                    forward by the inspectors; we couldn't do anything with a recommendation that
                    just said that the Embassy was too big. Months of back and forth with Washington
                    left a lot of ill feeling on both sides. Mansfield supported my positions, but
                    didn't get involved in the bickering. I am generally pro-inspection, if the team
                    takes the attitude that it is at a post to try to help to improve efficiency.
                    But when the team sees itself as an adversary, then an inspection is worthless
                    and maybe even worst. The end of this story was that the whole inspection report
                    was buried and considered null and void.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the quality of your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Tokyo had and has always had a first class staff. Being such an
                    important post, all agencies try to send their best people. The senior staff
                    were all very good. The language capability was adequate, certainly as far as
                    the Foreign Service Officers were concerned. The Economic Section could have
                    used more Japanese language officers, but to find people conversant both in
                    economics and in Japanese is very difficult. The Department has always had
                    difficulties recruiting first class economists and then couldn't really spare
                    the ones it did hire for language training, particularly hard languages. I got
                    along very well with the Station Chiefs, first Bill Wells, then Horace Feldman
                    and Bill Grimsley. That has always not been true for some of my successors. A
                    lot of Foreign Service Officers are just psychologically opposed to CIA and
                    therefore have difficulties relating to intelligence personnel. I had the full
                    cooperation of the Station which was helpful many times.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>The Embassy, traditionally, had been close to the American military contingents.
                    The Military Attach�s, as is often true in countries where the Defense
                    Department has troops or ships, did not play a significant role. We had an
                    American Military Defense Assistance Organization which was basically an sales
                    force for American weapon systems. It did not conduct any training functions.
                    The MDAO was part of the Embassy and the Chief reported to the Ambassador, but
                    his reporting channels were through CINCPAC in Hawaii. He had very limited
                    contacts with the other American military commands in Japan. Years earlier, when
                    we had a MAAG in Japan, there was some confusion about command relationships
                    because that group saw itself as a staff section of the US military command,
                    while the Embassy thought it to be an integral part o its operations.</p>
                <p>The Embassy had had a Politico-Military section with close ties to the Japanese
                    Defense Forces. By the time I arrived in Tokyo, that section had been abolished
                    and the work was being done in the Political Section by a politico-military
                    officer. The Political Counselor and his staff worked with the American military
                    stationed in Fuchu and provided the Embassy a day-to-day liaison. Of course, the
                    military could have contacted me at any time and the CINC could have called the
                    Ambassador at any time. But that rarely happened because the Ambassador only
                    became involved in large public issues and seldom, if ever, became involved in
                    operational matters. One that Mansfield was very active in was when an American
                    submarine rammed into a Japanese merchant ship and then submerged and didn't
                    stick around to see whether any assistance was required. Most of the issues that
                    required Embassy-Command contacts dealt with host nation support and sometimes
                    status of forces. The issue of Japanese financial support for American forces
                    was in part dealt by the Politico-Military section of the American desk office
                    of the Foreign Ministry and in part by the Self-Defense Agency. For the American
                    side, much of the work was done by the Embassy's Political Counselor supported
                    by US military representatives. The US military related primarily to the
                    Japanese on a service-to-service basis and with the Self-Defense Agency. If they
                    had a reason to contact the Foreign Ministry, they would go with the Political
                    Counselor or a member of the Political Section. Sometimes, the Counselor or a
                    member of his staff went to the Self-Defense Agency accompanying a US military
                    officer. The routine was well established and there were no bureaucratic
                    frictions between the US military and the Embassy. The Air Force Chief of Staff
                    at Fuchu was the primary American military representative who dealt with the
                    Japanese. He used to be in the Embassy almost on a daily basis and was certainly
                    in touch telephonically with us every day—either with me or the Political
                    Counselor. Whether I would be involved depended on the nature of the issue and
                    its importance and whatever level of the Embassy had to carry on the discussion
                    with the Japanese. For example, if a meeting of a Security Subcommittee was
                    required, then I would get involved. If an agreement had to be signed, that
                    would involve me. If senior Defense Department officials were visiting Tokyo,
                    that would also require my involvement. Those visits were not unusual; the
                    Secretary of Defense would come out at least once a year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about trade issues in the '77-'81 period.
                        Where the tensions already running high?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Trade issues were beginning to become sticky. Bob Strauss, then the
                    Special Trade Representative, had been given the mandate to do something about
                    the automobile trade imbalance as well as color TVs and some agricultural
                    issues. He was in Tokyo frequently, often with a very high P.R. profile. He and
                    Mr. Ushiba, former Japanese Ambassador to Washington and one of Japan's foremost
                    “American handlers” were the authors of one of the early trade agreements. That
                    was done in a two-three days “three ring circus” atmosphere. I participated in
                    the day and night long marathon meetings which took place mostly in the
                    Ambassador's Residence. Periodically, Strauss would pause and say that he would
                    have to call the President; he used to say that he had promised the President by
                    a certain time and that would always leave only a few minutes to wrap up one
                    issue or another. That would focus the Japanese mind once again and the
                    bargaining would resume. Those were wild meetings! There were simultaneous
                    meetings of a number of groups focusing on one matter or another. Dick Rivers,
                    the USTR's General Counsel and Allan Wolfe, one of the Deputy Trade
                    Representatives would be in different rooms meeting with their Japanese
                    counterparts. During these separate negotiations, Strauss would hide out
                    somewhere, meeting in secret with somebody theoretically unbeknown to anyone
                    else. At one stage, Strauss came to the Embassy where he was confronted with a
                    draft agreement that Rivers and Bill Piez of the Embassy had negotiated out with
                    the Japanese. Strauss didn't want to look at it; he kept saying that he was too
                    tired to look at anything. Dick Holbrooke kept after him—during critical
                    meetings, Holbrooke and Erland Heginbotham, his economic expert and other EA
                    staff members, would be present in Tokyo. Finally Strauss looked at it and
                    exploded. He wanted to know whether Rivers had really worked on it. When he was
                    assured that he had, he said that he would fire him immediately, if not sooner.
                    He had a number of less-printable expressions that he used periodically and he
                    would let them loose in a red hot string at moments like this. Perennially, we
                    had large meetings of this kind, with what seemed as if half of Washington were
                    in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>Then there was a Congressional trio who took a keen interest in US-Japan trade
                    matters. Jim Jones, the Congressman from Oklahoma, a Lyndon Johnson White House
                    staffer and now our Ambassador to Mexico, Sam Gibbons, a Congressman from
                    Florida and Bill Frenzel, from Minnesota would visit Tokyo from time to time to
                    pressure the Japanese on one trade issue or another. Mansfield always saw them
                    and worked wit them. Jack Button, then the Embassy's Economic Minister, worked
                    with this Congressional delegation, which played a very helpful role in focusing
                    Japanese attention on the seriousness of trade issues</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Then there was a period during which Frank Weil, the Commerce Department's
                    Assistant Secretary responsible for trade issues, used to visit Tokyo
                    frequently. He was interested in increasing Japanese imports of American
                    consumer products. The Japanese offered the use of their trade ship; that is the
                    ship which they used to promote their own goods by sailing it around the world
                    as sort of a mobile trade fair. The Japanese offered the use of the ship to us
                    so that we could take our wares to various Japanese sea ports. In the final
                    analysis, that ship ended up being a combination of military surplus wares and a
                    novelty shop. No serious American exporters were going to use a gimmick like
                    that. The ship did carry some American clothing, some furniture, some novelty
                    items, but it was not really a serious trade promotion effort. But the
                    preparations for the ship's sailing took up a lot of the Embassy's time and
                    effort.</p>
                <p>We made other efforts. The US-Japanese trade advisory council was very active
                    during the late '70s. There were lots of committees formed, some by the American
                    Chamber of Commerce in Japan and some formed by other groups. There was a
                    constant series of meetings and other public and semi-public events. The trade
                    issues did not lack attention, but the tensions kept rising. The American
                    Chamber had Mansfield's full attention; he was very active in that forum. The
                    Chamber met monthly with the Ambassador. We would brief the officers of the
                    Chamber, with Mansfield presiding over the meeting. He would listen to the
                    Chamber's views. He of course knew all the leadership of the Chamber as well as
                    many of its members because he devoted a lot of attention to that group. He
                    thought that an American Ambassador had an obligation to listen to and represent
                    whenever appropriate the views of American business in a foreign country. He
                    also thought that his relationship to the Chamber was useful in the management
                    of the trade issues. The Chamber did conduct a number of studies that were
                    useful to understanding the issues more clearly. You have to understand that at
                    this time there were probably 25,000 Americans in Tokyo, most of whom were
                    involved in trade issues of one kind or another. The Chamber was very active
                    under good leadership, which was assisted by a good professional staff. So the
                    Chamber had adequate financial and human resources to really represent the
                    American business community. The leadership would return to Washington for
                    annual meetings; during this period, it would visit important people in the
                    Legislative and Executive branches. They developed this routine in concert with
                    us. So the Chamber was an influential group on trade matters.</p>

                        with an account of the President Carter's visit in 1979. What do you
                        recollect from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: President Carter did come to Tokyo in 1979 and again in 1980 for the
                    funeral of former Prime Minister Ohira. The 1979 visit served two purposes: a)
                    Carter attended a G-7 summit— the Energy Summit— and b) a State visit. There was
                    the usual Presidential hoopla: large teams from Washington some of them arriving
                    three months before the event. More would come as the visit time neared and the
                    planning became more concrete. There were at least three hundred staffers and
                    press visitors during the President's visit. Secret Service had a 24 hour watch,
                    with twenty men on each shift. The Presidential communication requirements are
                    massive. There were two plane loads of press. There were all the experts needed
                    for the summit.</p>
                <p>Having been through a number of such Presidential visits, I think I had the
                    Embassy pretty well prepared and organized. David Lambertson, now our Ambassador
                    to Thailand and then the deputy Political Counselor, was in charge of the
                    day-to-day Embassy support activities. He was assisted by a young officer who is
                    now the DCM in Seoul, Chuck Kartman. The Embassy worked well with the Secret
                    Service, the White House Communications staff as well as the White House trip
                    planners. The White House political staff was primarily interested in
                    show-casing the President. Since Carter had a reputation for having started
                    “town meetings”, I suggested that we have one in Japan in the little town of
                    Shimoda. That was the port town that was visited by Commander Perry and his
                    black ships and where the first Consul General Townsend Harris had established
                    his residence and office. The Japanese were not at all happy with that
                    suggestions because they felt that the country “bumpkins” of Shimoda would ask
                    all the wrong questions and embarrass the whole country. The Japanese preferred
                    that Carter chat with a group of intellectuals—University professors, writers,
                    etc.—in Tokyo. In the end, atmospherics prevailed and the town meeting was held
                    in Shimoda. It was a warm and human session and the President and the citizens
                    of Shimoda communicated easily and smoothly. They asked human questions, not
                    very sophisticated, but much more meaningful to ordinary people both in Japan
                    and in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>When an Embassy is first told that a Presidential visit is being contemplated,
                    its first reaction is panic. The first question is whether the Embassy has
                    enough resources to plan and support a Presidential visit. The second question
                    concerns the routine work-load: can the Embassy both support a Presidential
                    visit and do its regular work? In fact, an Embassy stops doing its normal work
                    and concentrates entirely on the visit. After that, a list of issues is
                    developed; most of them concern logistics which are the responsibility of the
                    administrative section. Slowly, an outline of a schedule is developed; the
                    routes that the President is to travel are mapped our; stops and photo
                    opportunities are planned. Plans are developed for a communications system which
                    will get material to the President wherever he may be. That raises the major
                    issue of where the President stays. Carter stayed at the Ambassador's Residence;
                    that required the Mansfields to move all their personal belonging out of their
                    bedroom suite into another bedroom in the house, which, for ten days, was almost
                    the only room they were permitted to use. When Kennedy came to Rome, Ambassador
                    Reinhardt was ill and in fact was in the military hospital in Wiesbaden,
                    Germany. Mrs. Reinhardt was in the Residence by herself, but the White House
                    staff told her she would have to vacate the premises and suggested she fly back
                    to Virginia for a week while the Kennedys occupied the Residence. When Johnson
                    went to Bonn, it was the Hillenbrands—he was then the DCM—who had to vacate
                    their home. The Shermans were lucky; the White House advance team looked at our
                    house to see whether it wouldn't be easier to move us out, but fortunately our
                    residence was a little far away from the center of activities and more difficult
                    to secure. Of course, the Secret Service had to secure the house which meant
                    thorough sweeps and surveillance. Then come questions about the feeding and
                    taking care of the media; that is usually a USIS function. Then of course an
                    Embassy becomes somewhat of a translator between the White House and the Foreign
                    Office trying to explain the position of one to the other. The White House
                    believes that the President's schedule is their business; the host government
                    feels that it is in charge. Accommodations always have to be reached, but they
                    can sometimes take days and days. Tempers flare, feelings get hurt. There are
                    always major turf battles over who can attend what meetings or social functions.
                    I had a huge fight with Dick Holbrooke the night of the Imperial banquet. The
                    Palace rules are that the Ambassador and the Ministers of an Embassy are invited
                    to Imperial functions. Invitations were restricted to those few from the Embassy
                    plus certain people from the delegation of the visiting dignitary. Of course,
                    the number of people who would like to attend an Imperial function are always
                    many more than the Palace will invite. In our Embassy, there were two Ministers:
                    myself and Jack Button, our Minister for Economic Affairs. We received our
                    invitations. Holbrooke was incensed; he wanted to know why Jack Button had been
                    invited. He had a member of the EA Bureau with him—Alan Romberg—who he thought
                    should have received priority over Button. He stormed in his usual fashion and I
                    tried to explain the Japanese protocol to him. I told him that the Japanese had
                    their protocol and we were not in a position to tell them how they wanted to run
                    their business. He finally accepted that fact, but he surely was upset.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Once the visit is contemplated, then it is the sole issue of the day, day after
                    day, week after week and sometimes month after month. Japanese were and are
                    almost paranoid about security, partly as the result of the embarrassment they
                    felt when the Eisenhower visit had to be canceled because of demonstrations over
                    the Security Treaty. They have always tried to recoup from that failure. So when
                    an American President visits Japan, security is almost overwhelming and
                    certainly suffocating. For blocks around where a President stays, the police
                    form a cordon keeping all possible attackers far, far away. They had police
                    snipers on the roofs around the Chancery; I could see them every day from my
                    office as far as my eye could see. In the four or five weeks preceding the
                    President's arrival, the police and the military conducted massive operations.
                    Carter wanted to have a feel for Japan and the Japanese people. He wanted to jog
                    around the Imperial Palace, which is the preferred route for all Tokyo joggers.
                    Then we suggested using the Akasaka Palace—the formal reception building where
                    State dinners and other formal functions were held. No way! The Japanese
                    authorities just wouldn't even consider it. Finally, Carter settled for jogging
                    around the Ambassador's Residence where he was staying. Even that, barely passed
                    Japanese muster because someone could have taken a shot at the President from
                    one of the near-by roof tops. We did challenge the tight security that the
                    Japanese imposed; we constantly argued with the Japanese authorities about that.
                    But the Japanese insisted that security was their responsibility and that they
                    would be held accountable of anything had happened. That was of course true. The
                    Secret Service never complained about the tight security; they were happy with
                    it. But the White House political team and the Embassy did because the security
                    was limiting us in how we could present the President.</p>
                <p>On a couple of occasions, the President did manage to escape the security net. He
                    had visited Tokyo before as a member of the Trilateral Commission and therefore
                    had a favorite yakitori restaurant. One evening, the Carter family slipped out
                    and went to the restaurant, escorted by their own Secret Service, but not by the
                    overwhelming Japanese security forces. They stayed there for an hour or so; you
                    can still see a picture of the Carters eating there.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>The only serious glitch that occurred during the State Dinner that the Japanese
                    hosted. They didn't say anything while Carter was in town, but expressed their
                    great displeasure to us after everybody had left town. To this day, I am not
                    sure how the unfortunate incident took place nor at whose direction. The dinner
                    was at the Imperial Palace. Somehow or other, Cornelius Iida, the US official
                    translator, appeared on the scene and took a chair right behind Carter. That is
                    never done!. Emperor Hirohito had one translator, Ambassador Masaki, who always
                    handled all translation chores for the Emperor. He was the only one permitted to
                    translate for the Emperor and that was the way protocol had always been
                    conducted. All of a sudden the Americans produced their own translator; I don't
                    know how he got into the Palace or the dining hall. In any case, the Japanese
                    considered this a serious breach of protocol. I was as surprised as anyone else,
                    although there must have been people in the American delegation or staff who
                    arranged Iida's presence. In any case, after the President left the country, I
                    was summoned by the Chief of Protocol and told in no uncertain terms that Iida's
                    presence had been a major breach of protocol and that it would never happen
                    again. It had never happened before and the Japanese would never permit another
                    such serious breach of protocol. I forwarded the Japanese protest to our Chief
                    of Protocol, Kit Dobelle. I assume that she had some knowledge of the affair,
                    but I never heard another word about it.</p>
                <p>In general, I would say that the visit went smoothly. As I said, we had a large
                    staff in the Embassy; most of them had been involved in the visit one way or
                    another. Many had worked long hours for weeks before the visit. One would assume
                    that sometime during the ten days that Carter was in Japan, he could have found
                    time to talk to the staff. But we were informed that he would not have time, but
                    that Mrs Carter would address the staff. So on the day set for this appearance,
                    I went to pick up Mrs. Carter. She said that she didn't understand why the
                    President had not found the time to meet the staff; she said that she wished he
                    could because she understood that everybody had worked so hard to make their
                    visit a success. She was very polite; she met the staff and apologized for the
                    President's inability to attend. That was alright. I was told by someone in the
                    entourage that Carter just didn't make appearances of that kind. But at the end
                    of the visit, as he was about to leave the Residence for his flight to Seoul, he
                    mentioned to Mansfield that the Tokyo visit was about the best organized one
                    that he had ever been involved in. He wanted to express his personal pleasure to
                    the staff. Mansfield immediately called me to assemble the troops so that Carter
                    could meet as many as he could. I went to work immediately, of course, but we
                    couldn't even find the lights in the main auditorium. I didn't know where they
                    were nor did anyone else right at hand; they were hidden in some control room.
                    Our Administrative Counselor got into an elevator and stopped at each floor,
                    yelling out of the door for all who could hear to come to the auditorium to meet
                    the President. It was quite a flurry. Carter had to wait for a few minutes until
                    we could get the lights turned on. When we finally assembled as many as we
                    could, Carter spoke for about ten minutes very graciously thanking everybody for
                    their fine performance. People were grateful that he had done that.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>In all Presidential visits that I had ever been involved in, the White House
                    staff brings with them sackfuls of tie clips, cufflinks, pens and other
                    mementoes with the Presidential seal on them. Sometimes, it would be an
                    autographed picture of the President. These were given to those who had worked
                    especially hard on a visit. For that Tokyo visit, there was nothing. Absolutely
                    nothing. It meant that people like Lambertson, who really spent untold hours on
                    the visit, had no souvenir at all. When it came time to exchange gifts with the
                    Emperor, we presented a bunch of Norman Rockwell plates left over from the
                    bicentennial celebration. Who ever ran the Presidential gifts operations—I think
                    it was one of Carter's cousins—did it on the cheap, making the White House
                    appear like a country store. It did not make the U.S. look very good! When Lea
                    Anderson and I raised a question about the gift to the Emperor with some of the
                    White House staff, we were told to mind our own business in no uncertain terms
                    and never to mention the subject again. The White House did not handle the gifts
                    and souvenirs very well.</p>
                <p>The visit in 1980 was essentially unnecessary. Washington felt that there had
                    been a close personal relationship between Carter and Ohira. In fact, it was
                    more a public relations friendship than a real one. In any case, Washington felt
                    that it would be appropriate if Carter attended the funeral. Unfortunately, the
                    Japanese have a different attitude toward funerals. They don't usually have
                    State funerals for a deceased Prime Minister. Those funerals are much more
                    modest and no head of state is invited. Prime Ministers come and go with some
                    frequency; the Japanese plan relatively modest funerals for their political
                    leaders. For Emperors, it is a different story.</p>
                <p>So for Ohira's funeral, the Japanese were not soliciting high level foreign
                    attendance. I told Washington what the Japanese were planning and why. It didn't
                    pay any attention to our advice; Washington had made up its mind to do it its
                    way. The moment the Japanese were told that Carter was considering coming, their
                    plans changed; they invited a lot of other senior foreign dignitaries. In the
                    end, however, it was Carter and a few minor European royalty that showed up.
                    Other countries sent their resident Ambassadors or Cabinet officers. Carter's
                    attendance forced the Japanese to have a much larger funeral than they had
                    expected; it did show a close relationship between the Carter administration and
                    the Japanese, but overall, it made the U.S. look a little over eager. We didn't
                    have much time to plan since the funeral took place about ten days after Ohira's
                    death. As a matter of fact, I was in Hawaii when he died. I was attending a SSC
                    meeting. I had leave that abruptly and return to Tokyo to supervise the
                    arrangements for Carter's funeral visit. Given the brief period between the
                    death and the funeral, the Embassy wasn't out-of-business for nearly as long as
                    the previous year. Furthermore, funerals have an entirely different meaning than
                    State visits; they are therefore much less complicated to arrange and to support
                    a Presidential visit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In June, 1981, you were assigned to the U.S. delegation to
                        the UN. First of all, how did that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: I had left Tokyo in early 1981 to accompany the Japanese Foreign
                    Minister on a visit to the United States. He had a meeting set up with Haig in
                    Washington. Just before leaving Tokyo, I received a call from the Senior Officer
                    Counseling staff of the Department's Personnel Office. I was informed that I had
                    been on a list of candidates for the ambassadorial post in either Malaysia or
                    New Zealand. Some other Foreign Service Officer had been selected for Malaysia;
                    I had therefore become the Department's candidate for New Zealand. I was warned
                    that I might get a call from the President Reagan who established the practice
                    of calling candidates personally to ask the to accept an ambassadorial
                    appointment. By the time I got to Washington, Bill Clark met me at the airport
                    to tell me the New Zealand post had been given to a deserving political
                    appointee. I was fully prepared to return to Tokyo until the end of my normal
                    tour as DCM. It was a fine assignment and I had no problem staying in it. As
                    luck would have it, on my way back to Tokyo, I stopped in New York to see one of
                    my children. There I got an urgent call from the Japan desk telling me that
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick was looking for a deputy—it was designated as an ambassadorial
                    position. I was asked to make an appointment to talk to her. The suggestion came
                    out of the blue; I had no previous experience in multi-lateral diplomacy nor had
                    I ever suggested such an assignment. I met with her the next morning and had a
                    pleasant half-hour or so with her. I also met some of her own personal staff who
                    had been brought to the Mission with her. The day I met with Kirkpatrick and
                    staff was the day that Hinckley took a shot at Reagan. It happened while I was
                    on the plane flying to Columbus, Ohio where I was to see another of my children.
                    After that stop, I flew back to Tokyo.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later, Jeane called in the middle of the night and said that she
                    would like me to come to join her in New York. She described the job essentially
                    as a “DCM”; that did not mean Deputy Permanent Representative, but rather
                    someone who would run the Mission for her. She was having troubles with her
                    administrative officer, for example; also the political appointees and the
                    career bureaucrats were having trouble getting along. She wanted someone to
                    smooth those waters and be an inter-face between the political and career
                    staffs. I accepted and reported for duty in June, 1981.</p>
                <p>My views of the UN and an account of my responsibilities can be found in the
                    following excerpt from (”Representing America: Experiences of U.S. Diplomats at
                    the UN” by Lynda M. Fasulo, Praeger Publishers, 1984)</p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Although my job title is deputy representative on the Security Council,
                    by and large I haven't been involving myself with the Security Council.
                    Ambassador Liechtenstein is doing that. When Jeane (Kirkpatrick) asked me to
                    come, she said, “I need somebody to run the mission, somebody who'd do what a
                    DCM (deputy chief of mission) does overseas, somebody who knows the system and
                    how to make it produce, and that kind of thing.” So I've concerned myself in the
                    first instance with the management of the mission-trying to make the interface
                    between the mission and the State Department work, which, depending upon
                    circumstances, can be easy and can be very difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I also supervise and monitor the work of the political section of the mission;
                    the administrative section of the mission and the resource-management section,
                    which serves as a general accounting office for the U.S., making sure that its
                    budget doesn't grow too rapidly, that our contribution (to the United Nations)
                    is going to the right places, that new projects are examined for their fiscal
                    soundness, etc. It deals with U.S. citizens who are working for the United
                    Nations-recommending people, supporting people, or opposing people, and making
                    sure that we are adequately represented within the UN system. I also handle the
                    Trusteeship Council when it's in session, and the Fourth Committee, which is the
                    Decolonization Committee of the General assembly. I handle the Far Eastern
                    matters that come up and am ready to do anything else that anybody asks me to
                    do. We are rather loosely organized. We are the only mission in the world that
                    has five Ambassadors, and sometimes I think that the biggest contribution to
                    effective mission management would be to get rid of three of those, at
                    least-just have two, the boss and the deputy. But it still is necessary, I
                    think, and useful to have somebody from the career side of the service to rely
                    on to do a managerial job, and that's the way Jeane has used me.</p>
                <p>The big thing that has happened is the proliferation of mini-states-157 members
                    now, with places like Vanuatu, which used to be the New Hebrides. They hire a
                    lawyer here in New York, to represent them. He is not a Vanuatu citizen.
                    Obviously they can't participate in the full range of activities, but they have
                    a vote and it's the same weight in the General assembly as the vote of the
                    United States. A lot of the decision making is done by so-called consensus
                    process, where no vote is taken but nobody voices any opposition and you get a
                    compromise text; and that's consensus.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>It's basically a good way to address some issues, because in essence, that gives
                    everybody a veto. If someone doesn't join the consensus, there is no consensus,
                    and they have to take a vote. You might get voted down. I think as long as we
                    have the system, people should vote their conscience. They shouldn't be
                    constrained by the fact that they're the only one voting against it. They should
                    explain their vote. Many times we have stood alone on issues which we have made
                    a matter of principle. It's just the fact that it's so unbalanced-all of the
                    condemnations of the Latin American countries for violations of human rights,
                    with no reference made whatsoever to the countries in Eastern Europe, and no
                    reference whatsoever made to Afghanistan. What can I tell you? The UN tends to
                    use itself, in the General Assembly particularly, as a forum in which to wallop
                    South Africa and Israel at every opportunity but not to deal with an even hand.
                    That is not to say that the UN doesn't do some things very well. The UN
                    Development Program is extremely well run and it provides development funds for
                    lots of the Third World, and it's organized in a competent way. The UNICEF
                    (children's emergency fund), is a good, useful, and well-managed organization.
                    The UN peacekeeping activities in Cyprus and Lebanon and other peacekeeping
                    activities have been extremely helpful as buffers to keep people from killing
                    each other. I think actually [the United Nations] has probably been more helpful
                    in the crisis in the Falklands than it has been on anything in a long time. One
                    of the reasons, of course, has been that most of the action until very recently
                    has been taking place quietly and not in public sessions. The secretary general
                    has been operating and consulting with the Security Council in informal sessions
                    and with individual Security Council members. The whole argument has been kept
                    out of the limelight, and away from the posturing that takes place when you are
                    on camera and talking for the record. That's good, and it's a tribute to the way
                    this current secretary general [Perez de Cuellar] is operating. He's a creature
                    of the system, he's been with it for a long time, he knows its weaknesses as
                    well as its strong points. He's a bona fide Third World figure himself. He's a
                    very skillful diplomat, and he is an activist. His predecessor [Waldheim] was
                    much less eager to be engaged and came under criticism from people for not doing
                    more and not endeavoring to assert himself more. The Secretariat does what the
                    member states ask it to do. On the other hand, there are always ways for the
                    Secretariat to operate to insure that the members states ask it to do the right
                    things.</p>
                <p>Multilateral Diplomacy</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Multilateral diplomacy is a totally new world for me. It's not that you don't
                    engage in multilateral diplomacy in the embassies. You are constantly talking
                    with the country where you are about how we can concert with others to achieve
                    objectives. You are aware of what is going on in the world. But over here it is
                    a lot of just horse trading back and forth between delegations-trying to whip up
                    support; trying to find ways of accurately analyzing just how helpful or
                    unhelpful a given country has been to the things that you have wanted to
                    achieve. During this last session, we keep a list of all the votes which were
                    taken-and we had them prioritized into issues that were very important to U.S.
                    interests or less important, on a scale of one to three. We weighted the various
                    issues and then made computer print-outs of the actual voting. Needless to say,
                    you can't use this kind of record as an absolute measure that country X is very
                    much for you or very much against you, because many times there are individual
                    circumstances affecting an individual country. Its vote might seem negative by
                    your lights but it wouldn't be as serious a breach as it might for some other
                    country. Sri Lanka might have to vote some way because f its proximity to India
                    or because of its longstanding position on the Indian Ocean “zone of peace. “
                    Sri Lanka's negative vote on some resolution might not be as significant as a
                    negative vote of France or some other country.</p>
                <p>What we tried to do is to make the necessary corrections and come up with a score
                    at the end of the session, and then provide that information to our embassy in
                    the host country. We'd say, “This is what happened at the United Nations with
                    your country.” Our people in the host country might know that Pakistan, say,
                    voted this way or that way on one issue or another in the UN, but they don't put
                    it together in one conceptual package. We put it together in one package and
                    provide embassies with ammunition so that they can approach the host country and
                    say, “If you want our help to support your candidate for the International Court
                    of Justice,” or “If you want $100 million in U.S. aid,” then “we'd be much more
                    sympathetic if we had some unswerving support during the last session of the
                    United Nations.” It's not a big thing but it's one way of looking at
                    across-the-board performance. And that's the kind of thing that multilateral
                    diplomacy can do. The embassies in the field, on a bilateral basis, are now
                    prepared to say, “Swaziland, you haven't been doing anything for us lately, so
                    why do you expect us to do something for you?”</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>During the 1982 session, the nonaligned movement issued a communique' that was
                    markedly hostile to the United States. It singled out the United States by name
                    at least nine or ten times. The resolution, which was mostly produced by Cuba,
                    was rammed through the conference in the middle of the night when a lot of
                    people were not there. They deplored the situation in Afghanistan and in
                    Cambodia but they didn't name any country that might be connected with those two
                    operations. Anyway, Jeane wrote letters to each of the nonaligned signatories
                    who professed to be friends of the United States or who considered themselves as
                    allies. She just said, “I'd lie to know why you lent your name to a document
                    which so impugns the good name of the United States and which is totally
                    unbalanced. I'd be interested to hear from you.” Then, there was a brouhaha over
                    this being an undiplomatic way of dealing with the situation. She could have
                    ignored it, of course. There have been delegates here whose attitude toward the
                    Third World was: encourage them, be nice to them, don't get upset when they run
                    off the reservation, because they don't really understand what they are doing,
                    or they have other factors that condition this action. The best way to get them
                    on the democratic side is to be friendly and provide aid, and to ignore their
                    peccadilloes, as we'd do with a child. Jeane has not taken that approach at all.
                    She has asked people, required people, to say why they do what they do. It
                    produced some interesting results. Some people were outraged by it, but not
                    many. Other people were quick to disassociate themselves from the communique',
                    saying formally, “That resolution was not signed by us, nor did we agree with
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Our aim has been to make people understand that they are accountable for the kind
                    of things that they do. And some ghastly things are done. I mean, some lousy
                    resolutions get through, and by a large majority. we want them to know we take
                    them seriously.</p>
                <p>Most of the complaints about the U.N. irrelevancy have very little justification
                    to them. It's not the fault of the UN, but of the member states. The UN is not,
                    never has been, and probably never is going to be a world government which has
                    any authority or responsibility or opportunity for action that is not given to
                    it by the member states. Starting with the early concept of the veto in the
                    Security Council, the great powers have the authority to stop action before it
                    ever gets started. The only time really there has been any massive action by the
                    UN was under the Uniting for Peace Resolution on Korea.</p>
                <p>In recent years, that [Korean] situation has never repeated itself. as far as
                    Lebanon was concerned we had worked within the United Nations but also have
                    worked independently, with the multi-national force, with the Marines, with our
                    own special negotiators out there trying to do things. Meanwhile the UN has
                    continued to extend or reconfirm the mandate of the UNIFIL forces out there. But
                    we have never sought a new mandate. The resolutions brought to the Security
                    Council dealing with Lebanon over the roughly two years (1981-83) that I have
                    been here dealt mainly with extending the UNIFIL mandate, keeping things going,
                    and trying not to interfere with the negotiating process.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Another issue in which the UN obviously has some involvement in Namibia. The
                    negotiations, the actual front-line work has been through the contact group, the
                    five major powers-The United States, France, Canada, Germany, and England-and
                    those negotiations continue. We have independent contacts with the Angolans and
                    directly with the South Africans in attempting to bring to fruition a process
                    which will eventually be ratified or sanctified by the United Nations but where
                    the United Nations ipso facto has not itself played a direct role. There were
                    very much involved with special representatives of the secretary general and
                    others working in this area with whom we are very closely in touch. But
                    institutionally the United Nations has not been so much involved. I think this
                    is good in many respects, because it is a realistic acceptance of where power
                    is. There's no point in having a world situation that requires application of
                    power be handled by some organization that is impotent. You have to be able to
                    put your money where your mouth is. You can go back to Carlos Romulo [former
                    president of the Philippines], who has always said there are two UNs. there is
                    the UN of the specialized agencies and institutions-the UN of UNDP, the UN high
                    commissioner for refugees, UNICEF, WHO, ITO, and all of those-and there is the
                    UN of the Security Council and the General Assembly. The Security Council is the
                    only place where resolutions are fewer and further between than they have been
                    in a long, long time. There is a continuing politicization in the Security
                    Council. The General Assembly is irretrievably politicized. I'm fond of saying
                    it's a valid world and an important world, but it's not a real world. People go
                    to the United Nations to make a public statement within a world forum. it
                    provides that forum, and it provides instant headlines for anybody who speaks
                    there, but I don't think that people tend to speak there with much more than the
                    public relations aspect in mind. In other words, you don't go to the UN to ask
                    it to find solutions, because it's unwieldy for doing-it's not an easy forum in
                    which to get a solution.</p>
                <p>The Security Council has turned, unfortunately, into a mini-General assembly. we
                    have had virtually 40 speakers speaking in the Security Council. It's very
                    discouraging, and depressing. Time and again in recent months, issues that are
                    brought up in the Security Council are not even brought with a resolution, or a
                    request for a statement by the Security Council president. They are simply
                    brought up and everybody comes and speaks and then it all stops. There's no
                    resolution, the Security Council remains seized with the matter, or they call on
                    the secretary general to report, but there's no resolution.</p>
                <p>Any member of the Security Council can request the Council to hear somebody from
                    outside. If it's an Arab who is not on the Security Council and wants to talk on
                    the Palestinian question, he works through the Arab representative on the
                    security Council. With respect to the Libyan complaint against Sudan, for
                    example, the Soviet Union and Poland and other surrogates on the Security
                    Council would produce the people to speak. Of course the Korean Air Lines issue
                    was one in which we were very much engaged and in which the Security Council
                    provided to us a forum that attracted world attention. We pursued a resolution,
                    we got a resolution that was in the end vetoed by the Soviet Union, as one would
                    have certainly anticipated. However, the Soviets had only tow votes, theirs and
                    Poland's-even Nicaragua abstained; China abstained, to my surprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>China tries to maintain as independent a position as it possibly can, and to take
                    the philosophical position that all the troubles of the world come from
                    great-power confrontation, and that China allies itself with the aspirations and
                    expectations of the Third World, and takes no sides in the great-power
                    confrontations, that it opposes hegemony by whatever name it is called, etc.
                    Their role has been rather low profile.</p>
                <p>Some people say that by our confrontational attitude we've succeeded less than we
                    should have. But I don't believe that's the case. I think that our policy of
                    standing up and exercising the right of reply, of stating our position, stating
                    those things in which we feel our basic principles are engaged, has caused a lot
                    of the nonaligned Group of 77 to think more deeply about their position, their
                    own relations with the United States. This in the end is constructive for us. We
                    don't have to accept so-called built-in majorities. We don't have to just sit
                    there and take it. We are very active here in New York and also in capitals on
                    issues of concern. We've certainly lobbied heavily on Puerto Rico, we did a lot
                    talking around on the Korean Air Lines issue, not that we had to do a great
                    deal, but we did it. This mission has very good personal relationships with
                    almost every other delegation, and that's not to say just with our friends. We
                    aren't talking to the Libyans every day, or the Iranians, or people like that,
                    but we have elsewhere—we're open and candid with the Soviets, and certainly with
                    all of our principal allies, all the members of the Security Council, with the
                    major people on committees, and with the Secretariat.</p>
                <p>It's hard to say what kind of backdrop the Korean Air Line incident will continue
                    to provide. Those things don't live in public-consciousness very long, but
                    certainly the worldwide revulsion against the overall brutality of the incident
                    will stick around for awhile, and it may make less attractive or less reasonable
                    sounding some of the proposals, initiatives or rhetoric of the Soviet union. Not
                    just with us, but with people in the Third World who found that incident so
                    repellent.</p>
                <p>Taking the UN seriously</p>
                <p>As long as there are these vast majorities and bloc voting, and people do not
                    seriously deal with issues, the UN can't be taken too seriously. Virtually 80
                    percent of the resolutions that came to the General Assembly have to do with
                    condemning Israel or South Africa. They all pass by vast majorities. Since they
                    don't have any effect, nobody feels terribly strongly about them, and rather
                    than disturb their relations with people who aren't directly engaged feel
                    compelled to vote, and to cultivate votes against. So time and again the United
                    States and Israel have stood alone against 155 votes over there on one issue or
                    another. South Africa also has a built-in absolute majority-it may be 157 to 2,
                    but it could be 123 to something.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>The UN's resolutions don't have any particular force if no one chooses to abide
                    by them. Hundreds of resolutions are passed every year by the G.A. that just lie
                    fallow; nothing happens, except that they are publicized and the formal debate
                    is published. There is a moral force implied but the moral force doesn't require
                    a follow-up course of action. Sanctions are limited at best and the UN is always
                    very reluctant to vote to impose sanctions, which require, of course, Security
                    Council action. Reluctantly I would have to say that there isn't much being
                    accomplished over there except that, by its presence in some situations, the
                    United nations is able to deter or put off war.</p>
                <p>To be taken more seriously, the UN should be encouraged to do things it does
                    well, and stop doing the things it doesn't do well. And the only way to do that
                    is by voting against, or withholding funds as we are required to do by Congress.
                    The UN should not be in the business of provided training for the PLO, or SWAPO.
                    Those are not organizations recognized by the charter, and are in essence
                    terrorist groups.</p>
                <p>I would be hard-pressed to say that I thought the future of the organization was
                    terribly bright. I hope it gets better, and it does some things very well
                    indeed. Nobody else could do it. My experience here has made me a good deal more
                    realistic about the possibilities of achieving anything in a multilateral forum.
                    We can do a lot of things bilaterally, and we continue to do a lot of things
                    bilaterally, and based on those bilaterally achieved alliances or concurrences
                    of view we were occasionally able to do things in a multilateral forum. But the
                    forum itself is not at all relevant to the Realpolitik of the world. Decisions
                    that are being made are not being made in the UN. And I don't think anybody,
                    even the most idealistic, ever suspected that they would be.</p>
                <p>At certain heavily trafficked street intersections in Japan, they have traffic

                    keep waiting to get one installed here at First Avenue and UN Plaza-one that
                    plays the theme from “Twilight Zone.”</p>
                <p>(end of quote)</p>
                <p>In general, the UN was not very highly regarded by the administration. Jeane gave
                    a lot of speeches, taking a position similar to that described by William
                    Buckley in his book about his experiences as a delegate to a General Assembly
                    session — “A Dangerous Place”. She did operate around the UN with a great deal
                    of panache, while at the same time criticizing the institution in public and
                    private statements. I must say that she had some good reason for her attitude.
                    The UN was a hopeless institution in many respects. The General Assembly was
                    paralyzed; it could find common ground on its anti-Israel or anti-South Africa
                    censures. Basically, those were the only issues that the General Assembly
                    addressed. The Security Council was paralyzed by the Soviet and Chinese vetoes.
                    So the Secretariat, the General Assembly and the Security Council—that is the
                    New York components of the UN—were ineffective and valid targets for
                    criticisms.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>The other components of the UN—the specialized agencies—were a different story.
                    The UNDP worked well, WHO was a good organization, the UNHCR had a heavy burden,
                    the UNICEF worked well. There were a few that had troubles, like the FAO and
                    UNESCO. The ACABQ—the Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions—was a
                    nightmare; it was full of problems. The U.S. contributions were the largest and
                    one of the few that were actually made. So we began to stretch our payments out
                    in an effort to pressure the UN to reform. By and large, we were successful in
                    making an impact on the UN. A lot of people in the Secretariat and in other
                    missions had their feelings bruised. There were some Americans who felt that
                    Kirkpatrick's attitude was anti-international cooperation. In fact, what she was
                    trying to do was to assert American independence particularly when faced with a
                    decision by some international body which the U.S. opposed. Her view represented
                    totally the Reagan Administration's position, as postulated by Judge Clark and
                    Bill Casey. Shultz was more pro-UN, even though the Department's Bureau for
                    International Organizations—our support staff in Washington—was headed by
                    Elliott Abrams, when I first arrived in New York. He and Jeanne locked horns
                    almost from the outset of the administration and the Washington-New York
                    relationships improved only after Abrams moved to become Assistant Secretary for
                    Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which was later in 1981. Abrams was
                    replaced by Greg Newell, who had been a White House staffer.</p>
                <p>I said that I was the “inter-face” between the Mission and the Department. I
                    related to all parts of the Department and went directly to the regional bureau
                    involved in the substance of an issue. I did not work through IO; I did discuss
                    issues concerning international organizations with IO, but on country or
                    regional issues I dealt with the regional bureau. It was Jeanne's pattern that
                    as she would walk to her office in the morning, she would look in to see whether
                    I was in mine. If I was there, she would usually stop for a conversation. One
                    morning, she dropped in to tell me that she had unintentionally committed a real
                    faux pas the night before. She had been invited to a reception to be hosted by
                    one of the Far Eastern Missions. She was running late and in her usual fashion
                    she followed her security detail. They led her to the Third Floor of the General
                    Assembly building and to a room filled with people. Someone at the door bowed as
                    she came in and she thought that she was in the right place. She went to the
                    food table and picked up a shrimp. Just as she was about to eat it, the Chinese
                    Permanent Representative came up to her and said: “I am very surprised to see
                    you here. Please let me introduce you to your host, the representative of North
                    Korea!'. As the Chinese said that, a picture was taken. The look on her face
                    tells the whole story. She was obviously at the wrong party. Realizing that, she
                    made her apologies for being in the wrong place and walked out. When I heard the
                    story, I told her that it was very funny, but urged her to call John Holdridge,
                    then Assistant Secretary for the Far East, immediately to explain the
                    circumstances. Unless an immediate clarification were issued, the media would
                    report this and then she would find herself in the same position as Andy Young
                    had a few years earlier. She did call Holdridge and explained the mistake. It
                    was the kind of innocent incident that so often can turn into a diplomatic
                    nightmare.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>The Mission's social requirements were quite heavy. Every day ended with three or
                    four National Day celebrations or some other social functions. Mercifully, most
                    were held in the Secretariat building which was right next door. One of us
                    usually attended each of these occasions, but we spread the “pleasure” around
                    among the Mission staff so that Kirkpatrick or I were not always attending
                    social occasions. The Mission had other official more senior and closer to Jeane
                    than I: Ken Adelman—the Deputy Permanent Representative, Jose Sorzano—the U.S.
                    delegate to ECOSOC, Chuck Lichtenstein—the Ambassador for special political
                    affairs. The last two were close personal friends of Kirkpatrick's and although
                    on paper I was the third ranking member of the Mission, in actual fact, I ranked
                    behind all them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about the workings of the Security Council.
                        Were Kirkpatrick's statement cleared by Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: Rarely, if ever. She would sometime negotiate with Washington on the
                    substance of her remarks. Sometimes Washington would ask her to modify her
                    comments, but the text of her remarks were never cleared with Washington. That
                    gave her considerable leeway to react to unforeseen developments during Security
                    Council debates. Sometimes, she would leave the deliberations to have long
                    discussions and arguments with Washington, most often with Al Haig, then
                    Secretary of State. Sometimes, she just proceeded without consultations because
                    she had the strength of her convictions and knew that she could muster support
                    for her position. I should note that most of the Security Council meetings are
                    not public. It meets under the rubric of “consultations”, which are in effect
                    closed meetings. So by the time the actual Security Council meetings are held in
                    public, they are pretty well scripted and all delegations know what the others
                    will say on a specific issue. The only exception to that rule occurs if there
                    has been no agreement during the consultations. Then you have a public
                    confrontation often involving a veto by one or another of the Five permanent
                    members. Kirkpatrick did not attend most of the Security Council meetings. It
                    was left to Lichtenstein to represent the U.S., although on paper I should have
                    been the U.S. Representative.;</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>We spent a lot of time consulting with other national delegations on all
                    subjects. We split these up among the five U.S. ambassadors in the U.S. Mission.
                    For example, I dealt with the Asian delegations, Ken Adelman liaisoned with the
                    African, Jose dealt with the Latin American group. There were blocks in the
                    UN—e.g. Asian, Western European, etc—to which we belonged. These groups held
                    regular weekly meetings; they focused more on administrative matters than on
                    substantive issues. In most cases, what we were told by the UN delegations were
                    consistent with what our Embassies were reporting from their host capitals. The
                    UN national delegations were in general well informed and knew and represented
                    faithfully the views of their governments. That was true for us as well; we did
                    not lack needed information and had a pretty good handle on Washington views. So
                    the information network in New York worked pretty well. There were some very
                    good and active Ambassadors in New York like Tommy Koh of Singapore and Bira,
                    now the Thai Ambassador in Washington. They were very active and influential not
                    only with other Asian delegations but with all delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about the pressures on the U.S. diplomats
                        in New York which are unique to that Mission as compared to other U.S.
                        embassies around the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: First of all, New York is a bigger sea. There you deal mostly with
                    multi- lateral issues which are of interest to several delegations. Secondly,
                    there is considerably more “politicking” in New York than in a capital. That is,
                    there is a lot more vote swapping or “calling of chips” in New York than would
                    be in any capital. It is not rare that you call on a delegation and point out
                    that the U.S. was helpful in some prior situation and that now you expect
                    support from that delegation. Or a delegation would say than unless it received
                    support on some current issue, it would find it difficult to support the other
                    delegation in the future. Of course, some of that is done by our Embassies
                    overseas, particularly in reference to an issue being discussed in an
                    international organization, but not nearly to the extent that it is done in New
                    York. This kind of politicking went on all the time in New York. Sometimes it
                    was just a request to abstain on a particular vote. That occurred when we
                    understood that a country could not vote for a resolution; then we would ask
                    either for “abstain” vote or that a country not be represented during the vote.
                    On some issues, it was just important not to appear isolated; we knew we would
                    lose, but wouldn't wish to be in such a minority that it would be embarrassing.
                    For example, that happened on the vote on Grenada. We knew we would lose the
                    vote, but didn't want to be entirely isolated. So we worked very hard to “call
                    in some chips”.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>As I mentioned before, we always had difficulties marshaling a respectable vote
                    on Israel or South Africa issues. These questions had a large American
                    constituency, which required the U.S. to take certain positions. We frequently
                    found ourselves in a situation where we and Israel were the only countries
                    voting for or against a General assembly resolution. No other country was
                    willing to take the heat. They didn't have the domestic constituency that we
                    had; they didn't have the commitment that we had. We understood the situation;
                    we accepted the odds as a fait accompli and moved on to the next subject. Since
                    the votes in the General Assembly are non-binding, they have little effect in
                    the “real world”. In the Security Council, we, of course, had a veto. I don't
                    know how a new UN structure will be organized. there could be more members of
                    the Security Council; there could be more Permanent Members of the Security
                    Council or whether the new members would have a veto power. There will also be
                    questions concerning what was known as the “Non-Aligned Movement” or other
                    blocs. In the late '70s, many of these blocs were anti-west. Now of course we
                    have an entirely new world situation and I don't know how this plays out in the
                    UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about press relations and how the Mission
                        handled that problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: We had a USIS operation in New York, similar to what an Embassy might
                    have overseas. It was responsible for media relations. We issued the texts of
                    all statements and speeches made in public fora. Every major news organization
                    had a UN correspondent, who would contact the U.S. Mission for interview or just
                    briefing. They were very visible on TV or in the press; I think it is less true
                    today. You don't often see today a newsclip by a UN correspondent. But in the
                    late '70s, it was not a rare sight. Jeane made herself frequently available to
                    the media; she held press conferences as well as interviews. Sometime, we would
                    take the initiative and brief the media on a pending development. I can't
                    remember that we ever tried consciously to mount a media campaign in support of
                    one position or another. But when for example the KAL plane was shot down by the
                    Soviets, we were very aggressive in condemning the act with any media people who
                    would listen. We had charts, pictures and tapes—provided by a number of
                    different sources—which we used liberally to bolster our positions. Jeane played
                    an important role in the administration in the development of foreign policy;
                    she was a Cabinet member, but I don't think the administration ever used her to
                    carry its story to the media. She went back and forth to Washington all the
                    time; she would frequently make two round trips between New York and Washington
                    in one day. She was always behind schedule, but always plugging ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your comments about the UN in the interview quoted earlier
                        seemed negative. In the late '70s, did you have much hope for the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>SHERMAN: I viewed the UN as a paralyzed institution. It was frozen by its own
                    internal rules. The veto in those days insured that any Security Council
                    resolution was essentially sterile, except for whatever public relations effect
                    it might generate. It was clear that no major foreign policy breakthroughs could
                    be achieved in the Security Council. The General Assembly was almost a joke
                    then. But the situation has changed. The UN today is a far different place than
                    it was fifteen years ago.</p>
                <p>The specialized agencies were a different story. What ever positive contribution
                    the UN made to the world was done by and through the specialized agencies. The
                    U.S. Mission in New York did not spend a lot of time on the work of these
                    agencies; they were largely independent. Jim Grant ran UNICEF; Brad Morse ran
                    UNDP. Both those organizations ran efficiently and didn't require any meddling
                    on our part. We might talk to them sometimes on a particular issue, but we were
                    not concerned with the efficacy of their operations nor did we comment on any
                    day to day matters. They both were doing a very good job. We were concerned when
                    the UN was deliberating on the appointment of new officials for some of these
                    specialized agencies, like FAO and UNESCO. In most cases, the headquarters of
                    these agencies were outside of New York which made it difficult for us to
                    provide any oversight even if we wanted to. That was also true for the
                    Secretariat; it did not interfere with the specialized agencies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I was in New York when one day Paul Wolfowitz appeared. He was then
                    Assistant Secretary for the Far East. He called me and asked whether he could
                    come by to chat with me. I said “of course”. He came and offered me the job as
                    his deputy for Japanese and Korean Affairs. The idea did not come entirely as a
                    surprise to me because Paul had checked with Jeane first. I had met Paul at SSC
                    meetings when he was in Defense Department as Deputy Under Secretary for Plans
                    and Policy, but I can't say that I really knew him or vice-versa. When he talked
                    to me in New York, he acknowledged that he had met me before, but that his
                    request was based on the advice he had been receiving by many people.</p>
                <p>My main focus was Japan and Korea, but occasionally Paul would ask me to take on
                    area-wide issues. I replaced Tom Shoesmith, who was also the principal deputy.
                    But since I was the new kid on the block, I did not inherit that part of the
                    job. John Monjo had been there the longest and felt that he should therefore
                    become the principal deputy. That was not an issue for me; I couldn't have cared
                    less who was the principal deputy. So the senior staff consisted of Paul, John
                    Monjo, Bill Brown followed by Jim Lilley and Tony Albrecht, who handled economic
                    affairs, who was later replaced by Bill Piez. EA has always been a more compact
                    bureau than some of the others. The geographical divisions are not as sharp as
                    they were for example in EUR or ARA; we didn't have the fiefdoms that existed in
                    other bureaus. We were one family.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>The job of deputy was very interesting. There was never any lack of issues. The
                    morning would start with a briefing on the important overnight developments.
                    That was followed usually by a series of meetings, both within the Department
                    and in other agencies. Sometimes I would have meetings with representatives of
                    the foreign embassies who wanted to raise certain issues with us. If Paul met
                    with the Secretary or other senior Washington or foreign officials on issues
                    relating to Japan or Korea, I would usually sit in on those. There might be
                    meetings on studies that had been commissioned by the NSC or some other high
                    level organization. Most often, I would be charged with running these studies. I
                    sometimes I found myself drafting letters for Paul's signature on matters too
                    delicate to be answered by the staff. These required careful drafting and could
                    only be done by one of the deputies. Of course, some of my time each day was
                    spent just supervising and talking to the country directors. I have always been
                    a firm believer in delegating as much of the work as possible, but that also
                    meant that I had to be knowledgeable of what was happening. The days started
                    early and ended late.</p>
                <p>All of the deputies could and did have direct contact with the seventh Floor
                    staffs. Paul didn't want to be an unnecessary layer and he let us manage our
                    business to the maximum extent possible. We were, of course, always available to
                    support Paul during big events, like summits or high level visits. We also
                    supported the Secretary when he went to New York for the annual General Assembly
                    meeting which was always an occasion for some one-on-one meetings with his
                    foreign counterparts. I did a lot of travel; for example, I accompanied
                    Weinberger and Reagan on their trips to Japan and Korea. Paul didn't go on those
                    trips, but sent his deputies instead. Paul went with the President and the
                    Secretary; other Cabinet officers would be escorted by one of his deputies. The
                    deputies would serve as resources for the Cabinet officers so that they could
                    have some knowledgeable person at hand. I also spent a lot of time with the
                    Embassies in Tokyo and Seoul; part of that was on the phone and part was through
                    personal visits.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>As far as Japan was concerned, the principal issue was, of course, trade. It was
                    the same problems handled by the same people as was the case three and a half
                    years earlier. We had the same recommended solutions and met the same impasses.
                    Time had not moved since 1981. Washington lacked any appreciation for the
                    Japanese culture and style, just as it had in the late '70s. This despite the
                    fact that the leadership of the government had changed three years earlier.
                    Washington just has a blind spot to the differences between American and foreign
                    cultures. It is not a U.S.-Japan problem alone; it applies to all foreign
                    cultures. Washington people have Washington pressures; they respond to those by
                    stipulating certain aims. The inter-bureaucratic negotiations determine the aims
                    and the means of achieving them. Once those decisions are made, then our
                    embassies are instructed on what is to be done. They become strictly the
                    implementors. Good embassies take the opportunity to participate in the setting
                    of the goals or the means of achieving them and therefore are part of the
                    Washington deliberations and negotiations. But once the decision are made, the
                    embassies must follow their instructions. In 1984, I was in a better position to
                    argue and explain because I was Washington-based, but I can't say that I made
                    much progress. There were people who were bureaucratic adversaries with whom I
                    still have a close personal relationship, like Clyde Prestowitz, who was the
                    Counselor for Japan in the Commerce Department. He and I did not and do not see
                    eye-to-eye on how to best change the Japanese trade policies, but we are good
                    friends.</p>
                <p>I think the system works pretty well, once a new administration has gotten over
                    its phasing-in period. During the transition period, then policy development is
                    a problem. The new team is not familiar with the game, is not familiar with the
                    bureaucratic system. All new people come to the bureaucracy convinced that they
                    must change the system and bring a new clear vision to an administration. That
                    mind set may well raise some problems, as we indeed are witnessing today.</p>
                <p>I may have been more aware of the domestic discontent with Japanese trade matters
                    only because I heard the criticisms more frequently. But the Department of State
                    is not one of the agencies that receives a lot of domestic political pressures.
                    It is certainly not in the same situation as Commerce or the USTR. Those
                    agencies are in daily combat with the semi-conductor industry or the rice
                    growers' association or the automobile industry. We did of course hear
                    frequently from Congressional staffers about trade issues; that was enough to
                    keep us sensitive to domestic perceptions. I would be on the phone with the
                    staffers or would visit them in their offices frequently. The domestic politics
                    of an issue is always more important than the views of an expert or the
                    international ramifications. For a politician, the American voters are the ones
                    he/she serve, not a foreign constituency that has nothing to do with getting
                    him/her elected or kept in office. And that is the way it should be, as
                    difficult as that might make our international relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I had a lot of contacts with other agencies. In EA, at least, we had a weekly ad
                    hoc meeting, attended by NSC, Defense and CIA, chaired by our Assistant
                    Secretary, to discuss issues in the region. Rich Armitage or John Kelly would
                    represent DoD, Gastin Sigur or Dave Laux would represent the NSC. These meetings
                    would convene late Tuesday afternoons. All of the EA deputies would attend; no
                    one below that level was permitted to attend. It was a good forum to discuss
                    ideas about certain issues, strategies and tactics. It was a great technique to
                    synchronize the work of the major foreign policy departments and agencies.
                    People used these meetings as opportunities for discussions in depth; nothing
                    was held back. It was an off-the-record meeting and attendees were quite open
                    and frank. Some decisions were made although the forum was not empowered to do
                    so officially. But it did decrease the number of formal inter-agency meetings. I
                    think Dick Holbrooke had been the first Assistant Secretary in EA to use this
                    device; Paul used very actively and constructively. So the Bureau had very good
                    relations with other agencies. We did not waste a lot of time on bureaucratic
                    “turf wars”.</p>
                <p>On the Korean front, our major issue in the 1984-86 period was whether Kim Dae
                    Jung would be allowed to return to his homeland. He had been exiled a few years
                    earlier and the Korean government was still very reluctant to have him return.
                    There was strong pressure from human rights groups to have us weigh in on Kim's
                    side. There were also some Congressmen who weighed in on his side. There was
                    considerable interest in having a senior government official accompany Kim back
                    to insure that he wouldn't be harassed when he landed in Seoul.</p>
                <p>The Kwangju “incident” which had taken place three years earlier, was still being
                    discussed and used by human rights groups as evidence of the “brutal
                    dictatorship” of Chun Doo Hwan. I visited Kwangju during my tour as Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary and even though the event had taken place many years
                    earlier, I still heard many comments. That visit took place after Bill
                    Gleysteen, our Ambassador in Seoul at the time of the incident, and John
                    Wickham, then our CINC in Seoul and others had submitted a report on their role
                    in the Kwangju incident. Nevertheless, memories still festered and I don't know
                    that the report changed the minds of anyone in Kwangju. I just heard recently
                    from someone who had been in Kwangju; he reported that the same mistrust of
                    Americans existed as had 10-12 years earlier. There will never be an end to the
                    Kwangju episode. While I was the DAS for Korea, I was very much involved in the
                    debate on whether the United States or any of its representatives should subject
                    itself to testimony in front of the National Assembly or any Korean body. I
                    always opposed such a process, both on the precedent it might set and because I
                    was concerned that any statement would be twisted to serve the purposes of those
                    who thought it profitable to maintain an anti-American view. I visited Korea 5
                    or 6 times in that two year period and the subject of Kwangju was always raised
                    by someone. I went to the Security Consultative Group meetings as the State
                    representative on the American delegation.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>We also had some trade issues with the Koreans, like photograph albums and
                    footwear. Those are continuing issues which are usually always under discussion,
                    sometimes more intensely than other, but always there. During my tour as DAS we
                    also engaged the Koreans in low key discussion about the location of a new
                    Chancery. We were not making very much headway until the Korean Ambassador's new
                    residence in Washington was ready for occupancy. At that stage, I suggested that
                    the move might be delayed until we had some satisfactory answer from Seoul about
                    the future of our Chancery. Once I had suggested that, there was a solution
                    reached in a matter of days.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on the social circuit with both the Koreans and the
                    Japanese. I find it somewhat amusing that as soon as I left the Department, the
                    Koreans dropped me like a hot potato.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question about EA's ranking in the Reagan
                        administration's foreign policy agenda. Did the Bureau feel at all
                        neglected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHERMAN: I don't think so. Paul Wolfowitz certainly felt that he had the ear of
                    the Secretary and the President. We had no difficulty getting decisions or
                    guidance from the administration's leadership on any issue which we felt was
                    worthy of their attention. Mike Armacost was the Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs for much of this period; he was very sympathetic to our views and had,
                    of course, had a lot of foreign policy experience. Japan was high on the list of
                    foreign policy problem issues. Sigur was a bone fide Japan expert and therefore
                    didn't need a lot of background briefing while he was in the NSC. It was much
                    different than from what it is in 1994.</p>
                <p>There has never been an over-arching foreign policy for the Far East. The parts
                    of the Far East are too dissimilar to be covered by one policy. The Far East did
                    have a major role in our over-all Cold War national security strategy, as
                    illustrated by our forward deployments, the bases in Korea and Japan. By the
                    mid-80s, the question of troop withdrawal from Korea was no longer a subject for
                    debate; they were there to stay. The Japanese were making good strides toward
                    meeting their military roles and missions, under the Security Treaty and related
                    arrangements. They were increasing their annual contributions to meet our
                    financial cost of maintaining a military presence in Japan. Their defense
                    expenditures actually crossed the magic line of 1% of GNP. We had warm
                    relationships between DoD and its counter-part Japanese agency. I would say that
                    the strategic security aspects of the Japanese-American relations in the mid-80s
                    were in very good shape.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Trade was a troublesome issue, but it was not the over-riding tension that it is
                    today. There was no discussion of action and counter-action on part of either
                    the Japanese or the American governments. Trade had not become the general
                    policy question it is today; the discussions centered on one item or another.
                    Today, there seems to be a general U.S. government view that the Japanese are
                    not being fair and that therefore trade issues have to be discussed in some
                    comprehensive manner. That was not true in the !984-86 period. During most of my
                    tour as DAS, our relationships with China were stable and improving. There were
                    no major confrontation as occur presently. North Korea was under my purview, but
                    its policy was frozen in time and we didn't devote much of our efforts to doing
                    anything about U.S.-North Korean relations. We reacted; we did not try to
                    undertake any new initiatives. It is true that while I was the DAS, the Soviets
                    came to us to inform us that the North Koreans would accede to the
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty. That was the first time the North Korean had made a
                    movement to become part of the world community. The North also opened its
                    borders a crack by allowing some Americans—some even official—to visit their
                    country. It was also during this period that the Chun government opened some
                    secret channels for discussion with the North Koreans. We were well aware of
                    these conversations and we supported the dialogue letting the South Koreans
                    proceed at their own pace and in their own way. On one occasion, Ed Derwinski,
                    then the Under Secretary for Security Assistance, met a North Korean official in
                    Vienna. We had to walk back from that meeting because he didn't understand the
                    sensitivity involved in such an encounter. We had a firm policy of having no
                    contacts with the North Koreans.</p>
                <p>I found my tour as a DAS very interesting. It got me closer to the Washington
                    policy development process than I had been before. It was a difficult personal
                    period because I was quite ill for part of the tour and absent from the office
                    entirely. I enjoyed the two and a half years immensely and I think it was the
                    capstone of my career in the Foreign Service.</p>
