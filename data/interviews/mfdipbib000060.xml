                <p>Interviewed by: Jack O'Brien </p>

                <p>Getting Into Government Information Program, Then In Department of
                    State—Assignment To Japan Desk Of IPS: 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Charles Robert Beecham on July
                        5, 1990. My name is Jack O'Brien and we are here to talk about Bob's
                        experience in the USIA and its predecessors. Bob, how did you happen to get
                        into this profession?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: By accident, partly. But coming out of World War II I did feel there
                    might be things that could be done to help prevent that sort of event from ever
                    happening again. At the end of 1951, as I was finishing up a year and a half in
                    Corcoran Art School, I began calling various government agencies, including
                    State and CIA, looking for work. I remember calling the Department to talk about
                    a job with the information program and being told, more than once, that they
                    were not hiring. But as a kid in South Dakota when I was in the sixth or seventh
                    grade, one of my teachers was a guy named Everin O'Brien who at that point in
                    1951 was working here for South Dakota Senator Karl Mundt.</p>
                <p>I don't think I went to O'Brien purposely to ask him for help; it came up in a
                    conversation that we had over the phone about what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should explain that he was not related to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: When I told O'Brien I was not getting much encouragement, he said,
                    “Well, I know some people down there. Why don't I call them.” And, as you may
                    remember, the person he called turned out to be Dick Fitzpatrick. I went to talk
                    to Dick at some point and completed an application. Then, like a lot of others I
                    waited several months to get word that there was a job opportunity. When it
                    came, it involved a guy by the name Jack O'Brien, who I remember tried to
                    discourage me from accepting what they were prepared to offer me—a clerk-typist
                    position. Do you remember our discussion?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Well, as I recall, it was that I would take the job on the understanding
                    that I wouldn't be limited to clerk/typist activities, which you agreed to. I
                    think it was in February of 1952 that I started on the Japan Desk that you had
                    been brought in by Charlie Arnot to set up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and who else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Dottie Brose and Joe Reilly. I don't think I had any idea what I was
                    getting into at that point. It was a very interesting experience for me.
                    Certainly I hadn't ever been involved in anything like it. My only other
                    exposure to government was working at FBI headquarters for brief periods before
                    and after military service. My attitude toward work, I suppose, was that you
                    took what was available and went on from there.</p>
                <p>I remember spending as much time as possible talking to people about the
                    organization, trying to find out what others were doing and where they fitted
                    into the picture. I don't know if that was unique or not, but it was my
                    experience in the Agency as time went on, particularly in domestic parts of it,
                    that too many people rarely had a good idea, or much interest, in the way their
                    own job and their own office fitted into the larger scheme of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think, Bob, we might explain here that at that time,
                        1952, the Japanese were still getting acquainted with the rest of the world
                        and demands for information about America were almost unlimited. We had the
                        job of providing much of that, most of it in response to requests from
                        Tokyo. You and I were filing great quantities of copy to the Japanese press
                        at their request.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Being totally new to what was going on I don't remember having the same
                    sense of that as you do. Certainly, a lot of what I was involved in initially
                    was very routine and very clerical. I understood better later on, after getting
                    some opportunities to do some feature writing and reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I just came from five years in Japan and almost
                        everything that we were sending out was picked up in the Japanese
                        press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: When I went to Tokyo in 1955 I then saw the other end of the
                    operation—how every day we had scores of Japanese media people coming into that
                    building looking for the kinds of press and publications material, that the IPS
                    Japan Desk had been sending out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had that first IPS job for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: The place was reorganized shortly after I arrived and you became chief
                    of the Far East Branch. Then you went to Indonesia in 1953. Who took your
                    place?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Sayles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1955: Assignment To Japan As Assistant Publications Officer.</p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes. I did various writing, editing and reporting assignments in the Far
                    East Branch after the Japan Desk was eventually phased out. But for a time, I
                    guess, after Dottie Brose and Joe Reilly had left, I was a one-man Japan Desk.
                    That may have been the point when I became interested in going overseas,
                    particularly to Japan. I used to pester some of the personnel types regularly.
                    Eventually, the chance to go to Japan as Assistant Publications Officer
                    materialized. I think Bill Hutchinson, who had been Publications Officer in
                    Tokyo and was then working in IPS, was probably instrumental in getting
                    Personnel to consider my case.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Tokyo on May Day of 1955. It was raining and the Japanese unions
                    were out in force demonstrating. My hotel bed shook slightly the first night
                    from a small earthquake somewhere and added to the excitement. My new boss was
                    the Publications Officer, Carl Bartz. Clem Hurd was the Press Attach�, Charlie
                    Schroth was the Press Officer, Charlie Davis was there going to language school.
                    I knew all three at least slightly from their earlier work around IPS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Public Affairs Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Ken Bunce was there briefly. When he left Lew Schmidt served as both PAO
                    and Executive Officer. Later on, Joe Evans came out as PAO and Art Hummel came
                    as his deputy. USIS Tokyo was a large organization with numerous Americans and
                    dozens of Japanese employees. At the outset it seemed very imposing and somewhat
                    disjointed. I kept busy trying to catch on to how the program worked and how
                    people went about their jobs.</p>
                <p>I remember feeling that Lew Schmidt, while he was in charge, ran things with a
                    very firm hand, particularly with respect to money. I don't know why it happened
                    so early after my arrival, but I remember Bartz filling me in on some sort of
                    pamphlet project he wanted to undertake. He needed additional money for it, but
                    because he didn't want to talk to Schmidt about it, he sent me up to Lew's
                    office instead. It seemed to me at the time that Lew sort of kept the money
                    locked in his office and you went up and made a case for whatever it might be
                    you were planning to do. Later on, of course, I learned that that was Lew's way
                    of keeping the Branch Chiefs from quickly overspending their allotted
                    budgets.</p>

                <p>A. Birth Of A Japanese Language Magazine America (Beisho Daiori).</p>
                <p>Carl was a very inventive and articulate boss. He was convinced that one of the
                    things most needed in those days was a magazine that would put Japanese scholars
                    and intellectuals in touch with the thinking of their American counterparts. It
                    took months of constant, often frantic, effort on Carl's part to perfect the
                    concept, win Washington support and financing, line up Japanese specialists to
                    serve on the editorial board, recruit a Japanese editor, find a prestigious
                    publisher and settle on the dozens of American scholarly journals from which
                    materials were to be drawn and reprinted in Japanese in a new monthly called
                    America. Bartz and a hand-picked board of Japanese scholars reviewed the
                    contents of the American magazines and picked out those considered particularly
                    appropriate for Japanese readership. It was a huge success and I suspect became
                    the model for similar Agency periodicals later produced in Washington, Delhi and
                    other posts.</p>
                <p>I found myself trying to manage much of other publications programming over those
                    months, but recollect few specifics other than an ambitious, heavily illustrated
                    pamphlet on the Hungarian revolution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>B. Circa 1956—Beecham Becomes Publications Officer For USIS, Japan.</p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't recall exactly, but Carl left for Okinawa in a year or so and I
                    succeeded him. One thing that I should mention is that when I went to Tokyo I
                    really didn't have any deep interest or commitment toward the Foreign Service. I
                    went with the idea that I would do this for a time and then probably go back to
                    Washington and settle down into some job in IPS. I was offered a double
                    promotion the first time around in Tokyo. But since the Agency linked the double
                    aspect of it to my transferring to Foreign Service, I turned it down. I took a
                    lot of ribbing about that, but was lucky enough to be promoted again the
                    following year. This time they left me no options; to get the promotion I had to
                    convert. Of course, Jane and I were married by that time and I had a much better
                    understanding of what I was getting into than I had earlier.</p>
                <p>1958: Home Leave And Reassignment To Japan As Special Assistant To New PAO.</p>
                <p>My first tour lasted three years, as did all my other tours abroad, and when I
                    arrived back on home leave in 1958 you had already set the stage for what came
                    next. George Hellyer, then East Area Director, was getting ready to move to
                    Tokyo as PAO, was searching for a special assistant and had gotten my name from
                    you. During my consultation in Washington, George called me in to talk and ended
                    up offering me the job, which I accepted, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>A. New PAO George Hellyer Attempts To Reorganize USIS/Japan—Dissent.</p>
                <p>George arrived in Tokyo with the very clear notion that he needed to reshape the
                    Japan program. But to be quite truthful about it, he didn't seem to have a
                    really firm idea of what he wanted to do. I may never have understood what exact
                    problems he had with the existing program, but his determination to generate
                    change and improvement was obvious.</p>
                <p>I recall George saying to me, and probably to others too, that he wanted a new
                    country plan. In fact, he stressed he wanted a perfect country plan. I suggested
                    to him that a perfect country plan and a perfect country program would be ones
                    in which USIS worked itself out of a job. My thinking on this was probably
                    influenced by my association with Bartz and the America magazine project. That
                    was a prime example of American private sector influences being brought to bear
                    on the thinking of leading Japanese. I felt it made a great deal of sense for
                    the Agency to be promoting activities in which the natural forces within
                    American society were brought into play to accomplish what the Agency was trying
                    to achieve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did George respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Very enthusiastically, at least until he heard from people in Washington
                    that they didn't view it as a very practical idea for building an entire program
                    around. As you remember, it became a very controversial proposition and we went
                    through endless back and forth with Washington, plus at the Tokyo level an awful
                    lot of internal upheaval and dissension. George became pretty unpopular with
                    much of the staff. I guess I did too. Certainly the changes we were pushing
                    weren't very popular in many respects. I think it was Harry Keith, the Mopix
                    officer, who came up with the rather derisive term “thinkers and doers” to
                    describe the proposed staffing pattern. I remember John Reinhardt was very
                    skeptical about the whole thing. John was in Kyoto, I believe, as BPAO and was
                    only one of many who were very critical of the scheme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the John Reinhardt who later became
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: And eventually he was made head of the Agency under President Carter. He
                    then started his own “thinkers and doers” approach to Agency programming.</p>

                <p>BEECHAM: Well, it took root in the sense that the whole place was remodeled, new
                    offices were established. There were half a dozen or so officers who were given
                    assignments as what we called Program Officers. Their basic function was to
                    develop ways to reach influential Japanese, both individuals and groups, more
                    effectively than we had in the past. The emphasis was to be not only on Agency
                    or USIS products, but also on specialized materials coming from independent US
                    sources—authoritative research and analysis, scholarly articles, government
                    documents, Congressional hearings and reports, etc.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's summarize this Bob. How long did it go on and
                        what was the outcome?</hi>

                <p>B. Dissent And Problems With Ambassador Leads To Hellyer Departure anReplacement
                    by Bill Copeland.</p>
                <p>BEECHAM: The outcome, I think, was dictated by George's departure, more or less
                    under a cloud, not only because of the reorganization, but because of other
                    frictions involving the Ambassador. Months of preparations for the aborted
                    Eisenhower visit put an added strain on relationships all over the Mission
                    during that interval. I don't really know or remember all the story of George's
                    departure. But he was replaced by Bill Copeland who came in quite clearly to
                    reverse the direction in which things had been moving and to keep the Ambassador
                    happier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador at that time was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Douglas MacArthur II, who was replaced after Kennedy's election by Ed
                    Reischauer. I left in 1961 and came back to Washington uncertain about my next
                    assignment. What the Agency proposed for me was the USOM Information Officer job
                    in Bangkok. I was not interested in anything that removed me from USIS main-
                    stream activity.</p>
                <p>1961: Home Leave And Eventual Assignment To Year Of Academic Study At Stanford
                    University.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, several months earlier, when the Agency first announced the
                    beginning of a new academic training program, I had sent in a proposal to which
                    I'd given a great deal of thought. I wasn't offered any hope while on Washington
                    consultation that I might get one of the only two grants being awarded. In fact,
                    I ran into the Area Director, Paul Neilson, in the hallway one day and when he
                    asked when I would be leaving for Bangkok, I said I thought an academic year
                    assignment was still a possibility. “Don't count on it,” he said, in a way that
                    made me think that he and others who felt I was being uncooperative had already
                    fixed the outcome so far as I was concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We spent home leave in California that summer and it was not until the morning we
                    were scheduled to go to a nearby air base to get shots for Thailand that someone
                    from Personnel called to say I'd been given one of the academic grants, Barbara
                    White received the other one. The caller asked what I thought about trying for
                    admission to Stanford University under Agency auspices. I pointed out that the
                    school year was due to begin almost immediately and what I had in mind when I
                    conceived the proposal originally was an East coast university. Whoever I was
                    talking to said the Agency felt a need to “balance things off” and would like to
                    place an officer in one of the West coast institutions. So I drove over to the
                    Stanford campus and talked to T.A. Bailey, the historian, to see if he would
                    help me organize a program. He was very helpful. I spent a year at Stanford
                    studying basically post-Civil War American history, which I hadn't much focused
                    on since high school. I was a history major in college, but primarily in
                    European and ancient history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a worthwhile year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes. But less in terms of what I was able to accomplish academically
                    with a necessarily revised study program than as a way of distancing myself from
                    Agency problems for a year. I had come out of Tokyo feeling pretty badly beat up
                    and it gave me a chance to regain some perspective and new energy. It persuaded
                    me it was a good idea for people who had the chance to get away from day-to-day
                    operations to assess their own situation and that of the Agency.</p>

                </p>
                <p>July, 1963: Made Publications Officer, Bangkok, But Soon Replaced Press Attach�.
                    Vietnam War Buildup Brought Many Problems.</p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I was sent to Bangkok as Publications Officer. Within a week or so after
                    my arrival, the Press Officer was called home for some reason and there
                    apparently was nobody else around at the time who could replace him. I had no
                    strong feeling about it, one way or the other, but I remember my surprise in my
                    first meeting with Ambassador Kenneth Tod Young to hear Howard Garnish, the PAO,
                    assure him and Al Puhan, the DCM, that Beecham was highly qualified, based on
                    his experience in Tokyo working for Ambassador MacArthur. Actually, the only
                    time I had any direct contact with MacArthur on a press matter, the Ambassador
                    threw me out of his office for neglecting to take notes while he was dictating a
                    news release for USIS to send out about something he had said or done earlier
                    that day.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes. I have forgotten when you showed up there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: And, of course, I stayed in the Press Attach� job until I left Bangkok
                    in December, 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both of us can recall that those were busy years. You
                        certainly had your hands full with the press—not only American, but Thai and
                        others. This was, of course, the period during which we were deeply engaged
                        in Vietnam. How would you describe your problems during that period?</hi>

                    Caused Difficulty With Both US and Thai Press.</p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Well, I think my worst problem early on in our Air Force buildup there
                    was being left out of the picture for a longer period then was good for me or
                    good for the Mission. I simply did not know initially that we were preparing to
                    bomb and then bombing North Vietnam out of Thai bases. In my ignorance, there
                    were instances when I misled press guys about what was planned or actually
                    underway. The one I regret most was Frank McCullough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes. He never forgave me, I'm sure, for not in his view being straight
                    with him about it. But at that point I was as dumb about what was going on as he
                    may have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is important to point out here that Graham
                        Martin was then ambassador. He was superb in backing up USIA when it came to
                        a battle I might have with Washington. But Graham Martin did not believe in
                        a Country Team. He kept secrets to himself; even the DCM was not aware of
                        them at times. So it was Martin's style that kept you and me and most of the
                        other key people in the Mission from knowing what he was up to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I remember one conversation with him about the problem after it had
                    became fairly clear to many people that something serious was going on. Martin
                    suggested, “Well, why can't you tell them that the planes stop in Vietnam, that
                    they go over there to arm themselves?”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>There was quite a long period of time there when the correspondents were
                    convinced that Thai bases were being used for bombing runs in North Vietnam, but
                    could not get confirmation. Our friends in the military, as you remember, were
                    always anxious to get their story out about it, but they were kept under wraps
                    by Martin because of Thai demands that while the US could use Thai bases for
                    strikes against North Vietnam, we were not allowed to discuss the actual facts.
                    I don't think many correspondents ever understood that aspect of the
                    arrangements Martin had agreed to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The question that Bob describes is one that both of us
                        shared because of Martin's style of operating. It was absolutely ridiculous
                        for us to have to put on a straight face for experienced correspondents, who
                        had chapter and verse about our bombing of North Vietnam, and for us to
                        either deceive or put it in a way that made us look foolish. A Thai told me
                        one time that they were just big mosquitoes up there, going north.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Gradually Martin was out. There were more sources of information coming from
                    outside Thailand than there was from inside of Thailand. It led, later, to a
                    deal in which the United States and Thailand agreed to have an official
                    acknowledgment of what we were doing. That certainly was unusual in the many
                    interviews I have done, but I must say at this point that Bob Beecham had a
                    difficult time, but he handled himself beautifully.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I went to the Voice of America in the policy office, working for our
                    good friend, Paul Modic, who promptly went off on another assignment after
                    urging me to come work for him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that an unexpected assignment for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: No, I knew where I was to go. It wasn't one I would have chosen,
                    perhaps, but I didn't have any objections to it.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BEECHAM: I enjoyed that year at the Voice because it gave me an opportunity to
                    see parts of the Agency I knew little about and to get acquainted with a unique
                    organization and its staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you want to stay longer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: No, not really. When the opportunity arose for me to go back to IPS, to
                    run the Far East Branch, I was more than happy to leave, despite conversations
                    with some at the Voice about staying on and what might be in the offing if I
                    did. I had been there for a year and learned a good deal about it, but the idea
                    of going back to run the office that I had started out in was an inviting
                    proposition.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went back to IPS when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: 1970, as Far East Branch chief. I found on the staff some of the same
                    people who had been there my first time around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't remember. It must have been maybe two years before I moved up to
                    the deputy director's office. Lyle Copmann had been made director of IPS,
                    replacing Ken Towery when he moved over to run IOP. Lyle spent several weeks
                    deciding who he wanted as deputy. He never brought it up with me, but I know
                    that for a while he was a bit worried by indications he found in some of my
                    fitness reports that my operating style was not quite as gentle and easy going
                    as his own. I made sure it never became a problem between us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you have the deputy job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Two or three years. When Lyle left in 1975 or 1976 I was made
                    director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's combine this. From the Voice you went to the Far
                        East Branch in IPS. Then you became the deputy and then you became the
                        director. Can you review that period and comment on the changes you might
                        have seen since you were first there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't know if I can do it exactly that way. One of the views that I
                    returned with was that an IPS weakness had always been inadequate knowledge
                    about what goes on at USIS posts—insufficient sense of what materials field
                    posts need.</p>
                <p>A. Difficulty In Getting IPS To Understand Needs Of Field Posts.</p>
                <p>As branch chief, I tried to impress the staff with the value of the Country
                    Plans. Admittedly, when we were abroad, a lot of us thought they were often a
                    useless exercise. Whatever that case, they did in those days reflect what post
                    objectives were, what program activities were being planned and what kinds of
                    media and other materials were needed to carry them out.</p>
                <p>We developed our own scheme in the Branch to analyze the country plans from Far
                    East posts and then attempted to provide the information materials that were
                    being sought. I tried to get this idea across outside the Branch too, since
                    publications was a separate division with field servicing functions over which
                    the Branch had no control. I had had a run in with Al Roland, the Publications
                    Division Chief, before I'd been back two weeks, over whether his office would
                    provide us with regular reports listing the various materials that that division
                    was shipping to Far East posts.</p>
                <p>When you and I were there in the 50's, the regional branches called the shots on
                    virtually every field service. But all that had changed over the years.</p>
                <p>Roland, as I discovered after our dispute had gone on for a while, was one of
                    Towery's favorites and had been hand picked by Ken for the publications job. He
                    must have complained because it was not long before I got called in to explain
                    to Towery and others around the front office what the fuss was all about. The
                    only thing I remember about that session is that after an hour or so, Towery
                    ended it by shaking his head and saying, “I don't see what different it
                    makes.”</p>
                <p>Later on, when I decided I needed some outside help, I went to John Reinhardt who
                    was Far East Area Director then. After describing what I was doing in the Branch
                    in an effort to make it more supportive of field posts, I said that with his
                    permission I'd send him a more detailed memorandum and route it through Towery
                    in an effort to keep the IPS front office focused on field servicing issues and
                    related organizational problems. Towery may or may not have read or understood
                    the memo, but I know it floated around among his front office staff for months
                    and probably was among the briefing papers Lyle Copmann read when he was brought
                    in as Towery's deputy. He may have remembered it when he began looking for a
                    deputy of his own. Lyle, of course, as a Foreign Service Officer, had first hand
                    experience with the problems of field servicing from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Together, we put heavy emphasis on making it an IPS-wide practice to pay close
                    attention to field needs and country plans. Lyle was a master at bureaucratic
                    politics, and he made sure that the organization as a whole showed sensitivity
                    to what area offices thought the Press and Publications Service ought to be
                    doing to meet the needs of their particular posts.</p>
                <p>We always felt during those years that IPS was somewhat out in front of other
                    Agency elements in that important respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took charge of IPS and had authority that you had
                        not had before, did you make radical changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: No, I think all the changes flowed more or less naturally out of what
                    had been started or put in place by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were trying to consolidate them, perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: We were attempting some different things with staff also. We were trying
                    to get some IPS people abroad for at least one tour so that they would have
                    field experience to bring back and apply it in some fashion. That was one of
                    many projects more or less sidetracked by various changes made during the Carter
                    administration. Had things remained the same, I think it would have proved a
                    very useful Agency practice to draw more and more people out of Washington,
                    media elements in particular, for assignments overseas to give them a better
                    perspective on overall Agency operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it during this period that there were major changes in
                        the technical side in IPS, the means of sending the Wireless File, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes, that was when optical scanners were first put in the Wire Room.
                    About the same time or a little later automatic data processing equipment was
                    put into the Publications Division to handle the typesetting of magazines and
                    pamphlets.</p>

                        Was financing a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't remember now in any detail how provisions were made for the
                    financing. Probably most of the money came out of the Director's reserve or
                    other special funds, not the regular IPS budget. Ed Nickel was in Administration
                    in those days and was taking a special interest in our proposals for technical
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have at that time any major reductions in
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't think there were major reductions in force, but each year we
                    could count on having to cut a few positions. I think Copmann was always very
                    generous and cooperative on that score, considering that the normal bureaucratic
                    instinct is to enlarge staff or fabricate ways to avoid giving up resources. We
                    worked hard to consolidate and streamline IPS services so that we could give up
                    resources without seriously weakening the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize relations with other elements
                        of the Agency at that time? Was anyone standing over your shoulder, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Not really. Jim Keogh, when he was USIA director, took great interest in
                    what the magazine was doing. We had regular meetings involving Keogh and the
                    magazine editors to go over the contents of upcoming issues and discuss major
                    articles or treatments that were in prospect. Less day-to-day attention was paid
                    outside IPS to the other side of the shop, on the press side, the Wireless File,
                    for example. There was an effort during those years to upgrade feature and
                    byline materials going out under the IPS imprint. Staff written features were
                    cut back sharply in favor of authoritative articles commissioned outside or
                    acquired in the form of reprints. That trend started early when Copmann, for
                    budgetary reasons, decided to eliminate the Special Materials Branch which had
                    been the source of so much useless anti-communist output over the years. It was
                    a sacred cow and its elimination after hardly any debate left a lot of
                    old-timers very nervous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bob, you had the satisfaction of coming from a
                        rather lowly job in IPS to being in charge of it. I don't want to cut you
                        off in any part of it, but are there any general conclusions that you would
                        like to make before we go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I do have one favorite anecdote about that aspect of my career. Howard
                    Oiseth, who had been around IPS for years, even before I arrived the first time,
                    was one of those who was never really comfortable with many of our measures
                    altering IPS and his own, rather senior status. But he and I remained on fairly
                    good terms and when he finally decided to retire, I made a point of hosting an
                    office party for him so he could leave with something of a splash. Howard never
                    exhibited the greatest sense of humor in the world, but in his farewell remarks
                    he spoke about our association going back to my first appearance in IPS. “The
                    lesson of all this,” he told people there, “is be kind to your office boy, he
                    might grow up to become your boss.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, lets follow your career after IPS.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BEECHAM: That was a brief, unfortunate episode. John Reinhardt came back to the
                    Agency as director, apparently convinced that many of us had been around
                    Washington too long. It was true, I guess, I had been back some eight or nine
                    years. John seemed to envision a new agency in which service discipline,
                    particularly personnel regulations, would be fully restored. One aim was to get
                    certain senior officers out of Washington and into the field. I think John also
                    had it in mind that some of those who had been at headquarters for so long had
                    built up power bases of one sort or another and were going to be a problem as he
                    went forward with major changes.</p>
                <p>B. Publication By IPS Of History Of IPS Origins And Development.</p>
                <p>Nearly everyone could see that some sort of immense organizational shakeup was
                    coming. In IPS, one of our reactions was to publish a 70-page booklet that
                    contained the definitive history of IPS. We gave it the title, “The way it was:
                    USIA's Press and Publications Service (1935-1977).” It boosted staff morale at a
                    critical juncture, which was its principal purpose, but it also could be seen as
                    illustrating John's point about personal power bases. We didn't clear its
                    preparation or issuance with anybody and it was produced in our own printing
                    plant in Manila.</p>
                <p>Beecham Asked By USIA Director Reinhardt To Take Indonesian Language Training And
                    Go To Indonesia As PAO.</p>
                <p>John had asked me to go to Indonesia as PAO, and or course I recognized it was a
                    very good foreign assignment. But from another standpoint, after managing IPS,
                    where what I had to work with included a $12-15 million budget, a staff in
                    Washington of some 300, plus another couple hundred people at printing plants
                    abroad, it frankly did not seem all that attractive. Also, by that point, as a
                    class 1 officer with no advancement in prospect, I was beginning to feel I had
                    about served my time in the Agency and was not particularly interested in going
                    overseas again.</p>
                <p>A. Beecham Reluctant To Accept Indonesia Assignment Or Language Training, But
                    Nevertheless Enters Language Course.</p>
                <p>When the matter of Indonesian language training came up, I resisted, partly
                    because I did not want to put forth that kind of effort for a tour that was
                    going to last two years, or even less. I regarded it as a waste of Agency
                    resources, and I pointed out to Reinhardt and Personnel that come February 1980,
                    not only would three years from my last pay hike have passed, but I'd have
                    accumulated 35 years of government service credit as well.</p>
                <p>In January 1978, lacking any other acceptable options, I entered language
                    training, very uncertain about what I should do exactly. I found language study
                    very difficult, dull and time consuming. I didn't want to hold back the rest of
                    the class, so I worked hard enough to keep up, but I also began to take a
                    serious look at what might be possible outside USIA.</p>

                <p>B. Final Conviction That Indonesian Assignment Was Not Desirable—Appeal To USIA
                    Deputy Director Meets Silence. Final Days In Ambiguity.</p>
                <p>Before long, however, I began to worry that my fairness or loyalty to the Agency
                    might come into question later on. So in early April I wrote a letter to
                    Reinhardt's deputy, Charlie Bray. I told him I was exploring possibilities
                    outside the Agency, but still planning to go to Indonesia on the understanding
                    my tour would conclude at the close of 1979, a couple months earlier than
                    previously discussed. I enclosed a copy of an overview paper that I had written
                    to help search out any second career opportunities that might satisfy my
                    continuing interest in US public diplomacy. I did not want them to get feedback
                    from somewhere outside the Agency and not know what was going on. I also told
                    Charlie I was working up some comprehensive resume material and in that specific
                    connection asked him to do a fitness report on my last eight or nine months in
                    IPS.</p>
                <p>No interim or final fitness report, nor any other response, was ever forthcoming,
                    either from Bray or anybody else. I considered that a senseless, irresponsible
                    rebuff on Bray's part. I thought it flew directly in the face of John
                    Reinhardt's devotion to the rule book. I resented it then and still do.</p>
                <p>In any event, after a couple more months of Indonesian, that experience, plus the
                    steady flow of complaints and other distress signals coming out of the Agency,
                    persuaded me I should move my retirement date forward to the end of 1978. I
                    informed Reinhardt and others and said I was prepared to go to Indonesia for the
                    short period remaining. John expected me to go, but Mort Smith, who was the area
                    director, thought that made no sense at all. I had to agree with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For what period of time would this be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Well, it would have been for a six or eight month period. I had no
                    actual assignment from mid-1978 on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were just wandering the halls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: No, I didn't wander the halls, or twist in the wind either. I found a
                    spare office in IPS that I went to daily. People knew where to find me. Some in
                    Personnel, Ben Fordney for one, urged me to stay away from the Agency, but I was
                    not about to get myself in the position of failing to show up for work every
                    day. Some other people, Dan Oleksiw for one, offered to help out. Dan was
                    running inspections and tried to get me on some trips. I agreed to go, but never
                    knew for sure why they fell through. Front office intervention, probably.</p>

                <p>BEECHAM: By that time I was well along in planning the publication I started
                    later. Having been left to my own devices for six or seven months, I had pretty
                    much settled on what I wanted to try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is a separate story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Yes, that is right, even though the effort I put into publishing the
                    Chronicle, at least in my view, was simply an extension of my USIA career. It
                    was meant to be a constituency-building exercise. I'll always regret that the
                    Agency leadership, the Advisory Commission, and others weren't smart enough or
                    interested enough to see that. I got an appointment with John and went to his
                    office to fill him in so he would know where I was coming from long before the
                    first issue ever appeared.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BEECHAM: In the early years, it seems to me, the Agency's personnel policies and
                    practices created relationships somewhat similar to those in a very large
                    family. I think all of that changed when the career service came along. Things
                    became super-organized, complicated, systematized, and most of all,
                    depersonalized. Staff composition changed as well. When I first went overseas,
                    nearly all the people working at the post were experienced media people, or
                    specialists who had come out of advertising or public relations. We didn't have
                    many “generalists” in those days; they began showing up with the first Junior
                    Officer Trainee classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your comments on local employees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: Perhaps it was USIA people serving at foreign posts who gave the Agency
                    its special feelings toward the local employee. It seems to me that the Agency
                    took a great deal more interest in the local staff than the Department or the
                    Embassy ever did. In my view, USIA did an outstanding job in terms of trying to
                    see that local employees were properly compensated and had the opportunities
                    that they needed and deserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As of this date, do you think the Agency is properly
                        structured? Would you favor returning part of it to State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEECHAM: I don't know whether I would favor that or not, but it seems to me,
                    given what has happened internationally, it is awfully hard to make a case for
                    many of the activities the Agency has carried on for the last 10 or 20 years. As
                    the countries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union open up to American
                    influences of all sorts and there are no restrictions on the flow of information
                    from the United States, you don't really need a government agency to enlarge or
                    supplement that.</p>
                <p>Walter Lippmann, I discovered during the year I spent at Stanford, anticipated
                    some of the Agency's difficulties and short- comings over the years. He was
                    among those who testified at Congressional hearings after World War II when
                    legislation to form an overseas information program was under consideration.</p>
                <p>Lippmann argued it was a mistake to put bureaucrats in charge of a peace time
                    overseas information program on behalf of the US. It was his opinion that the
                    only kind of a program that made sense for a democracy of the American sort was
                    one based on the free flow of information generated by American society itself,
                    the media, academics, etc. That seems even truer today than it was at that
                    point, I think.</p>

                        observations or comments before I turn off the recorder.</hi>

                <p>BEECHAM: No, I think that is fine.</p>
