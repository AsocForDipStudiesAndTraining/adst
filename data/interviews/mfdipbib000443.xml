                <p>Interviewed By: Hope MacBride Meyers</p>
                <p>Initial Interview Date: March 5, 1987</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things certainly that I would like to talk
                        about is the changes that you have seen taking place in the Foreign Service.
                        After all, it has been forty years, and some, since you began, very young.
                        What changes do you see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: My father, my parents, joined the Foreign Service in 1922 and stayed in
                    until 1954, and during that period it was a very different Foreign Service from
                    the one we know now. For one thing, their pay, of course, was infinitesimal, and
                    they had to be supported by families back home. It was impossible to make do on
                    the very minimal salary that they got. Another thing is that nobody gave them
                    anything in the way of housing; not even the chief of mission had a house ready
                    for him and a great deal of time and effort and struggle was spent trying to
                    find housing for everybody. Oh, and another problem was that nobody had a chance
                    to go home, except alternating years for sixty days' home leave, and that was
                    after a long voyage either by sea or by land. There were no American schools to
                    speak of around the world, and that was a problem.</p>
                <p>On the good side, there were not more than two or three officers in almost any
                    embassy, and so everybody, even third and second secretaries, had the
                    opportunity to become Charg�s, and did, frequently. They had opportunities to
                    meet all the great and famous people, which is the fun part of the Foreign
                    Service. They had much more in the way of opportunities despite lowly rank, and
                    of course there were many years during the Depression when nobody got promoted
                    at all. So that was quite a consideration. By the time we came along, we joined
                    the Foreign Service in 1945, the pay had much improved; you could live on it,
                    and there was a great deal of attention to housing. Even in the lower ranks you
                    felt that the government was trying hard to provide housing for everybody. There
                    were still not very many American schools. When I grew up abroad, there were no
                    American schools. I went to German, French and Swedish schools. When our own
                    children came along...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that German, French and Swedish language schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you spoke all three languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I spoke all three languages, yes. Which was of course of great benefit to
                    me in later life, although I wish I had learned even more languages than that.
                    But by the time my own children came along, we still were at only one post with
                    an American school, Korea; and that school was due to the presence of the
                    American Army. Otherwise they had to go to British schools or international
                    schools. Anyway, our housing was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have to leave home to go to school in those
                        earlier days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, when they were eleven-and-a-half they went home to go to boarding
                    school. That broke my heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did, too, as a matter of fact, did you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I went back to boarding school at the age of fourteen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was interested in that because I almost went to that
                        school myself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, really? St. Timothy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to talk a little bit about that later, but please
                        don't let me interrupt you now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: One of the down sides of the time that we were in the Foreign
                    Service—despite improvements in salaries, home leaves and schooling
                    arrangements—was the way the Service was quickly filled in the post-war period
                    with the many officers in the middle and upper ranks who had little, if any,
                    experience in the Foreign Service. This was a problem. And then the embassies
                    got to be so big that we then had to have large support staff including
                    administrative officers and general services officers, so that our missions
                    became big and cumbersome. Host countries resented it. But we could go home more
                    often, and we did, although we rarely had the opportunities to become Charg�s in
                    the lower ranks and we met fewer famous people than we would have, had we been
                    the only people in the embassy. By and large, we served in a more physically
                    comfortable time.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Of course the very worst thing that ever happened to us during our period in the
                    Foreign Service was the McCarthy period. The terrible witch hunt particularly
                    persecuted our China language friends, of whom we had many. That was a very
                    black chapter in our history. When we left the Service in '79 there was a
                    tremendous revolution brewing about the wives' position in the Service. But I
                    don't feel able to comment on that because that really happened after we left.
                    And as far as we personally were concerned, in our latter years we had very
                    helpful embassy wives. We were very grateful to them for pitching in and doing
                    the work that needed to be done in embassies. But I realize that now it is much
                    harder for women to go abroad because they have their own careers to pursue,
                    which is almost impossible to do in a foreign country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed it is. It's becoming somewhat less difficult, but
                        for most places it is still next to impossible. I'd like to go back and ask
                        one thing. As the embassy personnel, numbers of bodies got bigger and bigger
                        did you, as someone who was concerned obviously about both the outside
                        impression an American embassy might have and the morale inside the embassy,
                        did you make particular efforts to see to it that wives who had not been
                        perhaps experienced in a variety of ways have help when they arrived at a
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, very much so. I think this was uppermost in my mind. I always saw to
                    it that people arriving were met and their houses had linens, silverware and
                    food and all the bare necessities to start with, and that somebody was assigned
                    to welcome the new family. I always remember our arrival in Korea with a
                    ten-year-old son and a fifteen-year-old son how our kind neighbor had brought a
                    large bottle of ketchup to welcome us. That was one thing that meant a great
                    deal to the boys. I also recall our monthly wives' meetings when we would
                    discuss our problems and how we could help each other tackle those problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, you were fortunate enough in the first
                        place to have women who shared your thoughts of what was necessary and had
                        to be done and so on, and at the same time it was a cooperative effort. You
                        perhaps making suggestions and giving directions, and so on, but wives also
                        themselves doing and contributing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I always encouraged them to follow whatever kind of interests they
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of things, speaking of lines of interest, did
                        you see also changing as time went on? For example, you began as a very
                        young, and in the case of Ambassador Green, Junior Foreign Service Officer,
                        in New Zealand. What sort of life did you have as a wife and as a
                        representative of the American government abroad in Wellington, for example?
                        By the way, I meant to ask you, Katherine Mansfield—did you begin this great
                        library with Katherine Mansfield?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, absolutely. Not only have I read extensively about her, but our
                    embassy chancery at that point was her former house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was a perfectly lovely red brick house, and the number two officer
                    lived upstairs and the chancery was downstairs. We are very sorry that we no
                    longer own that house because it was a lovely house, full of memories and
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How extraordinary! Was that known except to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes, yes, everybody knew that was Katherine Mansfield's house, and
                    treated it accordingly. In those days, as in most people's first posts, we had
                    small children. That takes up a great deal of one's time and effort. We had to
                    spend a lot of time house hunting; we finally found a house, and then we
                    entertained a great deal, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was the establishment then, because I know that
                        Mr. and Mrs. Service were there, and I think the Lees were there when you
                        were there when...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no, they succeeded us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they succeeded us. We were both third secretaries at the time. There
                    was a minister—it hadn't yet become an embassy—a first, second and third
                    secretary, vice-consul, army, navy and air attach�s, agricultural attach�, labor
                    attach�, and I think that's about it. But we were all great friends and we all
                    had a lot of fun. We were all rather young and gay. The war was just over. We
                    all suddenly felt as if life could be beautiful again, and New Zealand is a
                    lovely country with wonderful people and marvelous flowers, stunning
                    scenery.</p>
                <p>We all just had an awfully good time together. And we've all stayed friends to
                    this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many other national representatives—embassies
                        or legations—there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes, the normal amount, so we had a lot of friends in the other groups
                    too, and the New Zealanders themselves are very warm-hearted, open people. All
                    of us, I think, look back on our two or three years there as perhaps the most
                    fun time, the most carefree time we ever had, because it was not a country with
                    any great problems, and so we just enjoyed life to the full there. It was a
                    great place for our children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that you had a rather turbulent time, though. You
                        had graduated from St. Timothy's, and married, and had four years in the
                        Navy. Where did you go, where did Ambassador Green go to do his language
                        study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: To Boulder, Colorado. We started off, the day after we were married. We
                    went to Berkeley first of all, the University of California in Berkeley, because
                    that's where the Japanese language program for the Navy was supposed to be. But
                    after five months there was this great agitation to get the Japanese off the
                    West Coast, and so, because of our Japanese-American instructors, all of us had
                    to move to Boulder, Colorado, where the school stayed forevermore. It was an
                    extremely grueling course for the men. As for me, I was pregnant, learning how
                    to cook, and running the household.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, as I say already, by the time you got to New
                        Zealand it must indeed have seemed a safe-haven in a sense because you had
                        moved around a great deal. Because you came to Washington, did you not
                        after...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes. My husband, after graduating from Boulder was sent to the Office
                    of Naval Intelligence here in Washington, where he translated and analyzed
                    captured Japanese documents for the rest of the war. His orders never read for
                    more than six months, so we never really had peace of mind. We always thought
                    after the next six months he would go, but he was very fortunate because his
                    work was so highly specialized that he only left the country a few times to
                    interrogate Japanese prisoners. But basically he was involved in intelligence
                    work and working with captured Japanese documents, which he says was one of the
                    most interesting periods of his life because it was very challenging both from
                    the linguistic and war strategy point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Japanese a language that you became familiar with as

                <p>GREEN: No, I wish I had learned Japanese when I was a child in Japan when it
                    would have been easy, instead of learning German. As my life turned out,
                    Japanese would have been more useful. No, Japanese is a language in which I can
                    only say a few phrases and understand a few phrases, but it has given me the
                    facility of understanding Japanese when they speak English because they speak
                    with a very marked accent, usually stressing the wrong syllable. Many Americans
                    find it extremely difficult to understand even the most cultivated of Japanese
                    accents, but I find that very easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been interested in thinking about the way in which
                        your, that is to say, Ambassador Green's career developed. He be~an with a
                        very strong direction toward Japan, but actually never spent much time
                        there, except incidentally, shall we say. I was interested because I
                        realized that you had noted that he had received a decoration from the
                        Emperor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. That's one of the hard things in our Foreign Service. If we
                    had been in the British Foreign Service, and having specialized in Japan all our
                    lives, there would have been no question at all that he would have ended up,
                    culminated our career as ambassador to Japan. This would have been true in
                    almost any other country but in our country, where almost all the top jobs are
                    taken, or at least a huge percentage of our best jobs are taken by political
                    appointees. This was not to be, although my husband did specialize in Japan and
                    Japanese, and all such things, northeast Asia in general for his entire career,
                    and we always hoped and expected to go to Japan, and on three occasions we
                    almost did. But fate has a way of not working out always, but we have no
                    complaints. We had a very interesting career, and we were luckier than many of
                    our friends and colleagues. Only about five percent, I believe, get to the top
                    in the Foreign Service these days. It's very difficult and a lot of the cards
                    are stacked against people, against the Foreign Service specialists. And we're
                    sorry we never went to Japan. The Japanese had hoped that we would. They had
                    editorials in the paper; they wanted so much to have somebody who was a career
                    specialist in their problems. But that isn't the way it works in our
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been very few who could perhaps occupy the same
                        sort of place that Ambassador Reischauer did. Alexis Johnson, of course, was
                        another...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We would be more in the mold of Alex Johnson. Ed Reischauer, of course, is
                    an academic, and he had quite a unique position because of that reason. But that
                    doesn't mean perhaps that he was as experienced in political and strategic
                    matters, as Alex Johnson was.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we did. It wasn't so brief in Washington. We had three, almost four
                    years in northeast Asian affairs. Marshall had the interesting opportunity and
                    one that we welcomed very much of equal experience in the Department and in the
                    field. So we didn't have as many foreign posts as most of our colleagues, but on
                    the other hand, we had more of the Washington experience, which was good for our
                    children, and also for Marshall to learn the inner workings of the State
                    Department and the Washington scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I just divert for one moment to the association with
                        Japan which began before the war when the then very young Marshall Green
                        went out to Tokyo, with Ambassador Grew. What sort of a position was
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: First of all, let me say that this is one of life's curious crossroads.
                    Marshall was walking out of French class in Yale his senior year when he
                    overheard a classmate say that Ambassador Grew was looking for a Grotonian who
                    had just graduated from college to take to Japan as his private secretary for a
                    two-year period. So, Marshall overhearing this, immediately applied for the job.
                    And he came down to Washington where he was interviewed by Ambassador Grew in
                    his home on Woodland Drive. In the middle of the interview, Mrs. Grew arrived
                    and asked, “Who is this?” Ambassador Grew said, “Why, this is Marshall Green who
                    would like to be my secretary.” And Mrs. Grew said, “Well, ask him if he plays
                    bridge.” And Marshall said yes, he loved to play bridge, whereupon Mrs. Grew
                    said, “Well, take him, Joe, take him, and let's get it over with.” And that is
                    how our career started, because he played bridge, and Mrs. Grew wanted a bridge
                    player. So Marshall went out to Japan with the Grews for two years as his
                    private secretary, which was considered a training job for the Foreign Service.
                    Jeff Parsons held it before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Marshall Green already the thought in his mind that
                        the Foreign Service would be for him if it should turn out this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He always was drawn to it. His parents wanted him to be a lawyer, as his
                    father was, But Marshall had no interest in the law, and really longed to be in
                    the Foreign Service. He loved the foreign life and travel. His parents had taken
                    him abroad every single summer of his life after the age of six, so that he was
                    well experienced, but of course this was Europe. Everybody went to Europe in
                    those days, but I think that planted the seed.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Then he came to Japan and there met my parents. My father was then the political
                    counselor. They played bridge together, golfed together and partied together,
                    and he saw my portrait on the wall, and he read my letters home from school. So
                    he felt that he knew me already when he came back to America in the summer of
                    '41 to take the Foreign Service exams on a dreadfully hot summer's day in
                    Washington, and he remembered my mother's open-ended invitation to come up to
                    cool Maine, which is what he did, and this is how we met. And three months later
                    my father received the declaration of war from the Japanese government and was
                    then interned along with the rest of our diplomats. By the time my father came
                    home in August of '42, we were married and expected our first child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it must have been in a sense, considering the
                        turbulence of some parts of your and Ambassador Green's career, an oasis
                        again to have gone to Sweden...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it was. We loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also spoke Swedish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I spoke Swedish and settled right in, though Sweden is a hard country
                    to crack socially. But if you speak the language then it's very much easier and
                    the people there are absolutely charming. Everything about it was wonderful
                    except for the fact that we stayed much too long. It was a country where three
                    years would have been ample, but we stayed almost five years although we had
                    many other opportunities. But neither of our two ambassadors [W. Walton
                    Butterworth and John M. Cabot] there would ever let Marshall go, which was a
                    pity because we did have some very interesting opportunities offered to us, but
                    we could not accept them. I mean other posts, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This makes me think of the numbers of people who have
                        served with you and with whom you have served. What is it that I counted?
                        Ten secretaries of state...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh goodness, I never thought of it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's extraordinary to look at the record and see
                        both the numbers of presidents, the numbers of secretaries of state, not to
                        speak of, of course, ambassadors, both during the early stages of your
                        career and then yourselves as ambassador and wife. That must have, in
                        itself, required a good deal of skill on your part in relationships and
                        changing attitudes from post to post. Did you find that there was a certain
                        consistency, whether political ambassador or career ambassador, as you were
                        experiencing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GREEN: You know, I don't think we ever had any political ambassadors. I think all
                    our ambassadors were career ambassadors, which was a big help and consolation.
                    As far as secretaries of state go, that would be of no concern, really, to the
                    wife, only the husband. Especially when you are abroad your paths don't meet.
                    But when my husband was Assistant Secretary of State, then of course we were in
                    intimate contact with our Secretary and his wife, and we were extremely
                    fortunate in the ones we worked most closely with, the Rusks and the Rogers. And
                    both of them became really very good friends. We worked together in a most
                    harmonious way. So we were very fortunate in that respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were here in Washington, were you still very much
                        preoccupied with day-to-day living; did that keep you from having your own
                        interests...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was gung-ho on the Foreign Service. All during those years I was very
                    active. I never missed a meeting; we used to meet once a month, usually at
                    luncheons, I think. And I was very active in those things and very active in
                    Foreign Service panels of helping to answer questions from newcomers coming into
                    the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a good deal of family responsibilities of all
                        kinds, whether you were overseas...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Three sons. I was fortunate by the time we got to be ambassador that they
                    were already college age, and it was also easier for me to fly back and forth.
                    And when we were ambassador in Indonesia, for example, we kept our house [in
                    Washington] open with a housekeeper, and then I would fly back for their
                    vacations, just to keep the contacts going strongly. That was something that
                    couldn't be done when I was a child. When I went home to boarding school, that
                    was the end. I didn't see my father for several years. I saw my mother in the
                    summers, and that was about it. I was luckier that way. Marshall was very
                    generous about letting me go back and forth, so I could hold the family
                    together. In Korea we had the two younger boys with us. There we had several
                    political upheavals, and there were times when they were stuck in the 8th Army
                    compound where the school was, but I knew that the Army, our military friends,
                    would take care of them and give them shelter. It was an interesting experience
                    for them, and I'm glad that they were able to be with us for that. I wish they
                    could have been with us more in Indonesia because that was a wonderful, exciting
                    country.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes, we had two full-blown revolutions in Korea, and a long revolution in

                <p>GREEN: Oh, it was terrible. Oh yes, it was very difficult. It was easier for me
                    because the children were already in school in America, so all I did was come
                    home and join them. But for people whose children were out in Indonesia where we
                    had an American grade school at that point (now it's all the way to high school,
                    but then it was only a grade school), it was very hard for them to pull their
                    children out and then find another school that would take them just for one
                    semester. So I was much luckier than most.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the whole scene has changed. Diplomacy is still a vital arm of our

                    regard to the great numbers of visiting Americans.</p>

                        I think, a great deal of difficulty, to be perfectly honest about it, for
                        persons who were serving overseas who had to, or thought it was necessary,
                        to spend a good deal of time.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I wouldn't call it a difficulty because frankly we enjoyed it very
                    much. When we were Consul General in Hong Kong, we entertained over a thousand
                    Americans a month in our residence, many in response to instructions from the
                    State Department. We got hundreds of instructions from the State Department to
                    take care of Congressmen and their relatives and their friends and other
                    distinguished visitors. If distinguished Americans go to London and Paris, I
                    don't think they all feel that they have to go and visit their ambassador. But
                    when they come to Hong Kong perhaps they feel stranger than they would in London
                    and Paris. Everybody wants to come and see his representative there. So we had
                    masses and masses of Americans. But frankly I enjoyed that the most because we
                    met people that we would never have the opportunity to meet at home. I mean not
                    only the usual senators and congressmen and government people and Supreme Court
                    justices, but movie stars, bishops, and businessmen, I mean all walks of life. I
                    found it very interesting and something that I'd never have the opportunity to
                    do otherwise.</p>
                <p>It was hard work. I don't much care for late hours, but this was part of the
                    Foreign Service and we did it accordingly, and I must say that we found it very,
                    very enriching. And so often Americans, I think, tend to sneer a little bit
                    about entertaining lots of other foreign diplomats. They say it's rather an
                    incestuous circle, but the fact is that many of the foreign diplomats go home to
                    become their nation's foreign ministers or prime ministers or supreme court
                    judges. It gave me an opportunity to practice my languages. I always enjoyed the
                    representation part very much, and I think we did it to the hilt.</p>

                        representation, of course, as I'm sure you have, with the recent discussion

                        view of the cost of doing well what you have described so well. Were you
                        ever under the impression that some ambassadors, whether perhaps all or a
                        few or none, in earlier days had the benefit of contributions from...</hi>

                    one's entertainment allowance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Ambassador Tuthill's letter, you probably saw that in
                        the Washington Post. [Ed.: Washington Post, January 22, 1987. Three-times
                        Ambassador John W. Tuthill (retired) in an op- ed communication, maintained
                        that representational funds are now at a level sufficient to cover “all
                        essential entertaining” for an ambassador and his staff. He characterized as
                        “myth” the belief that “only the rich can take ambassadorial posts.”]</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course. I was interested because he made, I

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I feel very strongly that the government should give adequate
                    entertainment allowances and not allow anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure that most people have had to manage one way or
                        another. In earlier days, of course, it was a good deal less able to be
                        managed without a private income. But in more recent years, I think...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, but there are ways of entertaining. You don't have to have champagne
                    at every party. You could have very informal, less expensive kinds of
                    entertainment. There are all kinds, all gradations—whatever would suit you.</p>

                        the country, wherever that may be, concerns contacts with other Americans in
                        the same country or in the same city, business people largely, and so
                        on.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Missionaries, of course. Business people in more recent
                        years, at any rate, have also spent a great deal of money on
                        “representation,” and often very effectively and successfully. Did you find
                        that the business people with whom you came in contact—I think of Hong Kong
                        in particular, and elsewhere...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, and Indonesia, too. I, we, found them of very high caliber, much
                    higher than I remember from my childhood. They were very, very high caliber, and
                    we enjoyed the associations very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the fascinations that I have had in thinking of
                        your particular experience is what has appeared to me to be a very
                        successful separation in your case of the public person and the private
                        person. How have you managed to do this so well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, heavens, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because, after all, the life that you've described already
                        indicates an enormous amount of time spent in organization, in the doing of
                        it. True, I suppose you had a good deal of help at various times, perhaps in
                        some places very little...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: And some help is a great deal better than other help. For example, in
                    Indonesia I think we had a grand total of 35 domestic staff for the embassy
                    residence, and the grounds and the weekend house, and so on. And yet whenever
                    the doorbell rang in the afternoon, guess who answered the door? I did, because
                    whoever was on duty was sound asleep in the kitchen. So there was help, and
                    there was help. We had a marvelous staff of Chinese that helped us in Australia
                    and of course marvelous Chinese when we were in Hong Kong, when we really needed
                    it, because in Australia the social life was a great deal quieter than in almost
                    any other place. But in Hong Kong we really needed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>But we've always had a very strong family unit. I think when you travel and you
                    are uprooted, it's important to do as much as you can to hold the family
                    together, and we've been successful that way. We kept the same house here in
                    Washington. I think that's important. And we didn't rent it out. We kept it so
                    that the boys would always have a place to come to, and we always had a resident
                    housekeeper to keep the house going, so that although we didn't always live
                    here, at least it was the same house with their old toys in the attic and things
                    like that. And now we are reaping the fruits of that effort to keep the family
                    together because, although the boys are all grown up and in their thirties and
                    forties, we see a great deal of them, we do a lot of things together. Our second
                    son is following in Marshall's footsteps, not in the Foreign Service, but as a
                    public health anthropologist going to the Third World, and bringing public
                    health programs as a sub-contractor to AID. And so we feel that we have been
                    enriched by our Foreign Service life in a family way, and I'm thankful to heaven
                    that I had the opportunity to go back and forth a great deal and keep those
                    bonds strong. Many of our Foreign Service friends had so much separation from
                    their children that they've drifted apart. I think that that is a very sad
                    thing. We really worked overtime to keep the family together. Hold it
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was particularly conscious of this, I may say, because I left home at
                    fourteen and never lived under my parental roof again. So I knew how easy it
                    could be to drift onto other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Ambassador Green with his busy schedule have a good
                        deal of time that he could spend with your then very young sons first and
                        then growing up...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he always tried to devote weekends to them. He used to go bicycling
                    with them, and walk around golf courses and look for golf balls, and go to the
                    beach and go to sporting events, and horror movies and things that men and boys
                    like to do. Yes, he tried, he did his best to keep his weekends for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's unusual because I have had the impression that in
                        many cases, no matter what the circumstances might be, it was very often the
                        wife who perforce did the kind of thing that you describe keeping the family
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GREEN: Of course I was the only one free to go back and forth from Indonesia and
                    Washington and Australia and Washington. And these are long and difficult trips,
                    but it had to be done. When we were in Hong Kong, which was our most active post
                    of our life from the point of view of representation, we did keep Sundays
                    sacred. I mean unless the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee came to
                    town, we would simply keep Sundays sacred. We had only one son with us then, and
                    we would do whatever he wanted to do. We always went out to lunch, we used to go
                    over to Repulse Bay and go to the beach, and have a wonderful lunch over there,
                    and if the weather was bad, we would go downtown to a movie and have an ice
                    cream soda and a hot dog. Whatever it was that he wanted to do, that's what we
                    did on Sundays. We always let the staff off, and we had just a pickup supper at
                    home, and it was a family day, that was very important to all of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can see that it would be. In Indonesia, to move to
                        there, you experienced a very turbulent political scene and spoke about your
                        having to be evacuated, and so on. Was that an experience that brought
                        embassy people together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Very much so. We had revolutions both in Korea and in Indonesia, and as a
                    result, both of those groups were very, very close to each other, and we have
                    stayed close to each other. We are still great friends with the people we were
                    together with both in Korea and in Indonesia because we went through some
                    frightening and difficult times together, bullets flying, tear gas all over the
                    place, our children in danger. It was an experience that forged us together. I
                    do think that this is one of the great advantages of hardship posts, and that
                    embassies do become very closely allied. In easy, comfortable places like
                    Australia you don't have that deep bond; you're just pleasant acquaintances. And
                    then I think you more or less forget about each other when you move onto the
                    next post. But we'll never forget the people we were together with during the
                    revolutions in Korea and Indonesia. This meant a great deal to all of us.</p>
                <p>And you see how each other performs, too, in moments of danger. I'll never forget
                    in Korea when the second revolution broke out, and it was a fierce one, what did
                    I see but all our service attach�s in an automobile convoy all headed for the
                    safety of the 8th Army compound, whereas we embassy, Foreign Service people all
                    stayed downtown with the bullets flying. And you never know yourself how you're
                    going to react until you are in a situation like that. I remember during the
                    Syngman Rhee revolution, which was just two months after we arrived in Korea, I
                    was caught on the streets with machine-gun fire raking us all, people droppinall
                    around us. I was thankful to find that I did not panic. I was not afraid. I
                    found it all of great historic interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>And then I was the only foreign representative who went to the hospitals the rest
                    of the week, where all those poor torn bodies were, because in a divided country
                    like Korea, the police did not have 15-caliber bullets as we do in this country.
                    They have 50-caliber bullets, so that if you get shot in the arm it tears right
                    through your chest and your lungs and everything else. It doesn't just sit in
                    your arm and get plucked out later on. So the wounds were horrendous. I couldn't
                    speak a word of Korean, which is an extremely difficult language. We'd only been
                    there two months. I simply went from bedside to bedside, and embraced the
                    weeping mothers. None of the other people, you know, cared to face the Korean
                    hospitals with bodies all over the floor, and so on.</p>
                <p>But it was a very moving experience, and as a result, and looking back on our
                    career, Korea is the country that means the most to me because I have been the
                    closest to them. And they know that, and they know that Marshall was very close
                    to them, and very influential during the 1961 military coup in his fierce
                    upholding of democratic principles, even though Washington gave him no
                    instructions. (He was Charg� d'Affaires at the time.) [President Kennedy and
                    Secretary of State Dean Rusk were abroad, and although the Fat East Bureau
                    supported Marshall's position, it was opposed by some in the Pentagon.] For over
                    72 hours he had to fly this one completely by himself. The Koreans recognized
                    his work, and he is part of the history of Korea. And any time we go back now we
                    are treated almost as one of them. And therefore Korea is a very meaningful
                    country to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see how that would be. You have spoken, from the
                        first time we met, with obviously a good deal of knowledge about the
                        political situations wherever you might have been. It had struck me that
                        that wasn't necessarily the case with other people whom I have known in the
                        Foreign Service who enjoyed the life, perhaps, or didn't enjoy it, as the
                        case may be, but who knew comparatively little about what was going on. Has
                        that been your experience? Or do you think most of the people, I am talking
                        about women, with whom you were associated, were concerned about, interested
                        in, informed about what was going on in X country at X time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think that one would meet as many of one kind as of another kind. In my
                    own case, Marshall, I think, is a very brilliant political observer, and we
                    would discuss these things at length. He always shared his thoughts with me. He
                    often let me read think pieces that were not classified, he always discussed,
                    sort of thought aloud about how he saw the political situation. I love politics
                    anyway, having been born and bred in the Service, having listened at the
                    breakfast table to all kinds of politics in all kinds of countries. I was just
                    lucky to have a husband who shared a great deal with me. Everything that he
                    could share with me he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has struck me that you might have been fortunate in
                        that respect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh very much so. He also did it as a protection, because he says a little
                    knowledge can be a very dangerous thing. You know, I might perfectly innocently
                    say something wrong, and so wherever possible he always did tell me what the
                    situation was so that I wouldn't put my foot in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that extend, I don't mean in any other than an
                        organized way, to other embassy wives? Was there in any embassies where you
                        were any attempt, as there is now in many embassies, from the beginning at
                        the arrival of an individual at a post, to focus on the country, the
                        political situation, the cultural situation, and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think this is where those monthly wives meetings come in. We always had
                    speakers. If we were going through a political time somebody who would explain
                    the politics to us, or if there was an economic time then we'd have somebody to
                    explain that. And we certainly always kept up with the cultural programs.
                    Indonesia is of course particularly rich in culture and we had any amount of
                    subjects to discuss there. But we did try to keep the embassy wives informed. In
                    Korea, for example, I always brought the newcomers up to the demilitarized zone
                    so they could see and learn, and I was amazed how little they knew about the
                    Korean War considering we were there just six years after the armistice was
                    signed. I would have expected that more people would have been more aware of
                    what happened—Pork Chop Hill and where the armistice was signed, and all those
                    historic places. So I made it my business to take a carful of newcomers every
                    single time that they had a meeting once a month, sometimes twice a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also, I think, introduced the embassy to American
                        soldiers serving in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, this was one of the very enriching factors as far as I was concerned,
                    to be in a country along with some 75,000 of our own compatriots in the
                    military. I thought of them as being young men far from home and frequently
                    lonely, and so on. In November they had a special day in which they hoped to get
                    to know the community better, so I opened up the Embassy Residence for anybody
                    who cared to come, and I got all the embassy families to invite as many home for
                    a home-cooked meal as they possibly could handle. It was an extremely successful
                    program involving many hundreds of soldiers who were stationed in the Seoul
                    area.</p>
                <p>It certainly continued for a few more years, and I hope it is still continuing
                    because I think it is an awfully good idea. Because it is a lonely, hard thing
                    to be a soldier far from home in a strange country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed. Were there other activities that you can recall
                        that embassy wives, particularly American women, engaged in, perhaps again
                        in the later years of the time that you were in the Service, charitable in
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Particularly Korea and Indonesia, Hong Kong to a lesser extent. You
                    can't do much in the way of charity in either Sweden or New Zealand or
                    Australia. In fact I was just re-reading one of my old letters from Sweden and
                    found that Marshall had been summoned to the Foreign Office where they very
                    annoyedly told him to please stop Americans sending CARE packages. Here they
                    were with one of the highest standards of living in the world, and they were
                    extremely insulted because they were suddenly getting bombarded with CARE
                    packages from America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That was in the early fifties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't realize they had gone on as long as that.
                        Somebody didn't push the button.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: But in Third World countries like Korea...of course Hong Kong is a
                    prosperous place, but on the other hand they are terribly overcrowded with
                    refugees. The mainland pushed their lepers and their blind across the border,
                    and we had a lot to do there. We were well organized. There were wives who
                    studied Braille. I myself used to visit the leper colony island regularly, as
                    I'm very interested in that sort of thing. And orphanages, and all those...I'm
                    trying to think, we mostly worked with children, the sick and the blind, as far
                    as I can remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that other diplomatic national groups who
                        went abroad spent as much time in that kind of activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think the Americans are always in the forefront because we're the people
                    who believe in volunteer work, and in doing things for our fellow man. It
                    doesn't come as naturally to anybody else, but they are frequently inspired to
                    follow in our footsteps. In Indonesia there was a very good system because all
                    of us, regardless of nationality, belonged to the Women's International Club
                    which was all half Indonesian and half foreigners. So we worked together with
                    them, not as the Americans distributing largess, but as concerned women led by
                    our host country, the Indonesians. So that was the most active and
                    well-organized, and I though the best way to approach the problem, not just to
                    have American. Of course when they decided to have a bazaar then there would be
                    an American booth and a French booth, and so on, and we'd all bake up our own
                    specialties, and things like that. It wasn't just the Americans handing out
                    largess. That's what I liked about it. We were the Women's International Club
                    and we worked under that banner.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of things there were undertaken?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Mostly orphanages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the structure of the organization were the Indonesian
                        women themselves particularly active?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they are. They are known as the iron butterflies. They are the
                    stronger member of the species. The men are, well, I don't like to say weak, but
                    they are not nearly as active and forward-looking as the women are. It's always
                    the women in Indonesia who are running the households, Keeping the accounts,
                    speaking up for their rights. They are very indomitable people. They are
                    excellent. Far Eastern women are much more doers, I think, than we give them
                    credit for. The Thai women, for example, keep their own names and have always
                    had their own properties and their own careers, as have the Indonesians. So it's
                    not really the three steps walking behind that we are accustomed to thinking
                    of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have found in my experience in Japan, for example,
                        that it might have seemed so, but in fact ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, but in the other countries it doesn't even seem so. Because they
                    have always been able to have their own money, their own jobs, their own
                    names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other question that I wanted to ask you about is
                        again, I suppose, something that really was, in the time that you were in
                        the active part of your life, not a problem. That is within the embassy
                        community, wherever that might have been, were you aware that there were
                        problems of alcoholism, drug abuse, and that sort of thing, and if you did
                        see that, how was it handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Alcoholism, yes, I think that's a thread that has always run through. I
                    can remember many of my parents' friends being decidedly alcoholic. I never knew
                    or heard or even thought of drug abuse. That is something that came on the scene
                    after we left the service in '79. At least I suppose it must have been there
                    before but nobody ever thought about it and nobody ever heard about it, and
                    nobody ever talked about it. But alcoholism was always a factor. I myself never
                    drank a drop because I was always terrified that I might say something that I
                    shouldn't say, and because I had seen so many people slide from social drinking
                    to heavy drinking. As I never cared for the taste anyway, I was strictly a soda
                    water person from the beginning to the end of our career, and thankful for
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>In our last few embassies we had a medical section. It's one of the places where
                    I think embassies can afford to swell a little bit, as it is very handy to have
                    your own doctor. They would simply handle the situation if it got out of hand.
                    The person was sent home. There were always a number of breakdowns, too. They
                    would be taken care of by the embassy doctor and then sent home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I realize that these are matters that very often were
                        not discussed in an earlier day. Now, I think, much more openly, and
                        probably better that they should be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Of course alcoholism, I think, has always been discussed because I can
                    remember my parents talking about their friends who drank too much, knowing even
                    as a child which ones they were. But I must say, in Third World countries it's
                    very comforting to have an American doctor on the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I have spoken about now several
                        times, and that is the obvious division in your life between, as I have
                        called it, the public person and the private person. Where did you begin to
                        assemble this extraordinary library that you have, all of which obviously
                        consists of books that have been read and not just put on a shelf to look
                        at.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Oh, my goodness. I think it started when I was an only child of a
                    Foreign Service family living abroad, often with languages that I didn't know.
                    Even though I went to school and had plenty of school friends, still that left
                    many, many lonely and empty hours, particularly the weekends. I learned to read
                    when I was five and I haven't stopped since. I feel very deprived if I can't
                    read for several hours every day. It's one of the reasons I'm so happy that I
                    don't have to go out to dinner parties nowadays because I have a great deal of
                    reading I want to do. I read entirely fact. I never read fiction unless it's the
                    classics, because I tend to remember what I read, and I don't want to clutter up
                    my mind with things that aren't true. I'm particularly interested in history,
                    both past and present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spoke about the letters of Queen Victoria. I don't
                        know many people who, in the first place, would have the letters of Queen
                        Victoria, but would have read them as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Nine volumes which I collected laboriously over the
                    years—curiously enough in second-hand bookshops in Sweden, where they had no
                    interest in the subject, or at least in English books. And it led me to a very
                    curious encounter. The Peruvian ambassador in Sweden turned out to be the
                    descendant from a daughter of James II, Arabella Stuart. He was a direct
                    descendant on the wrong side of the blanket. And when he saw my nine volumes of
                    Queen Victoria, he then anonymously left at my house two volumes of her early
                    diaries which she had written before she was married. They are two of my prize
                    possessions now.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I thought that was such a nice thing for him to do. I knew immediately who it
                    was, even though he left these books anonymously at my house. But I knew that
                    nobody else cared about Queen Victoria's letters besides me. I made my husband
                    read quite a few of the letters because a number of them were pertinent because
                    history so often repeats itself. I remember there was a question of naval
                    visits, the pros and cons, and that was something we were discussing in Sweden
                    at that very time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then you had already from obviously a long time in the
                        past an interest in things medical, not an attribute of most people I've
                        known anywhere. For example, my mother is one of the few people I know who
                        probably should have been a doctor but wasn't able to be. But the intense
                        interest you've had and the application of the interest...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Living in Third World Countries you are faced with dysentery and diseases
                    of that nature, so it makes you very interested in prevention primarily, and
                    then what to do when you do get it, what to do about diets. A lot of people came
                    to me for help in this regard. I remember when we were in Indonesia, Washington
                    was not on speaking terms with Bulgaria, but I'd always heard that the Bulgarian
                    yogurt was the best, and when you have had diarrheal diseases nothing is better
                    for you than yogurt. And I simply went and called on the wife of the Bulgarian
                    ambassador and I said, “I hope that I may just come and greet you as a private
                    friend. I understand that you make wonderful yogurt, and could I have, would you
                    be generous enough to let me have, a few spoonfuls so that I can start it up for
                    our own embassy staff, many of whom are really getting quite ill with
                    dysentery?” And so that was a big help, and one thing always leads to another.
                    When you learn a little bit about something you want to learn more and more.</p>
                <p>For the last fourteen years, more than fourteen years now, I've worked as a
                    nursing assistant at Sibley Hospital, and every day has been an education for
                    me. The nurses have been very generous about letting me assist them in all kinds
                    of interesting though rather gruesome procedures, and I have felt that every day
                    has been a learning experience. My friends now call me up and tell me their
                    symptoms and ask me what kind of doctor they should call. But it's good to have
                    an interest of your own. Of course in our day wives couldn't work and didn't
                    work and so I'm glad that I read a lot about medicine and developed this
                    interest because I knew the day would come when we would be retired, and the
                    children would be grown up and that I needed something of my own. Now I work
                    half the week at Sibley and I find it very useful and very enjoyable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that other wives were of your knowledge as
                        successful in the more or less conscious developing of an interest such as
                        this; or do you think there was a good deal of variation perhaps in people's
                        interests and in how they pursued them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>GREEN: I think people who don't prepare for retirement are making a mistake
                    because it's going to happen to us all. We don't believe it at the time, but
                    sure as death and taxes it's going to happen. I think you really have to plan
                    for it ahead of time. My husband planned his line of interest, which was
                    population, the problems of population pressures in the world, and this is
                    something he can pursue in and out of government, and something that he feels is
                    worth giving his all for because it is a vital subject and he has done
                    everything he can to awaken people to the need of this. And so his retirement I
                    think has been a full and worthwhile one. In fact he got the Director General's
                    Cup for having used his retirement years to the best, in the best way. He
                    received a really moving citation about his valuable work in making the world
                    conscious of this problem and how to cope with it. I had my hospital work to
                    fall back on and we've built our house in Maine for vacations—but we don't take
                    many vacations; we'd rather keep on working. But I do think that my friends who
                    did not plan for retirement and who did not have a consuming interest or goal in
                    their lives are not happy now. I really see a lot of my dear friends who seem to
                    have rather empty lives, and I'm very thankful that both Marshall and I have our
                    own consuming interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would be very sustaining as well as a
                        carry forward of all the things that both of you have been concerned about
                        and with over most of your earlier life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It's very true. On the surface it would seem that the Foreign Service is
                    not a very good background, but it is, because in Marshall's case it gave him
                    the rank and the position so that he could go and talk to government leaders all
                    over the world. In my case it gave me a facility to talk and to relate to total
                    strangers at a moment's notice. I have had very enriching times with the
                    patients because I am able to talk to any Tom, Dick or Harry on his own level.
                    My colleagues marvel at this, my colleagues in the hospital. I tell them it was
                    because I spent my life, my whole lifetime in the Foreign Service where you
                    learn to make friends immediately because your paths may never cross again, and
                    you only have two or three sentences in which to connect with a fellow human
                    being. I've done this since I was a small child, and it's been a great help to
                    me in the hospital, especially with my dying patients. You are immediately able
                    to dispense with all the little defenses that everybody has in life to really
                    get down to and be close with a person. I do attribute that ability to my
                    Foreign Service life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that in contrast people who have not availed
                        themselves of these opportunities when in the Foreign Service missed a great
                        deal? Do you think that it takes a certain personality and temperament to
                        experience the best of what diplomatic life can give which is, after all, at
                        its very base exchange of ideas and communication between individuals, as
                        well as, of course, in the more formal sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>GREEN: I think that's the more enriching part of the Foreign Service—the contacts
                    that you make, the extraordinary experiences you have and the possibility of
                    meeting all kinds of people that you never would otherwise. I think that the
                    successful people are those who leave themselves open to these experiences,
                    learn from them and grasp the next one that comes along. You always find a
                    minority who wish that they had never left home and who have a great difficulty
                    in facing up to cultural shock. But I really think they're in the minority. Most
                    people get a great deal out of it and it shows up in different ways. Some people
                    write articles, some people teach. Different people use this opportunity in
                    different ways. It is a great opportunity. I think being in the Foreign Service
                    is a—very wonderful and remarkable thing because it took us to corners of the
                    globe we never would have been able to visit otherwise. Marshall was able to go
                    to the South Pole and to remote South Pacific Islands. I really am thrilled that
                    my life was in the Foreign Service, and I wouldn't have had it any other way.
                    Now whether I would feel that thrill joining the Foreign Service today is quite
                    a different matter, but I think we had the best of it, and I don't feel able to
                    discuss the way it is today because I don't know enough about it. But from what
                    I see and hear, it doesn't appeal nearly as much as the way it used to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm reminded, of course, of the unhappy differences that
                        are already in place and have taken place and probably will increase. You
                        speak about the ease of exchange of ideas and so on with other people, but
                        that in itself is becoming more and more difficult as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: And of course we haven't mentioned terrorism. That is the thing that has
                    changed the most, that changed the whole face of the Foreign Service, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is what I was about to ask you, whether or not the
                        kind of experience that you have had is going to be possible as time goes
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't really know about the Service today; it's so different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reading, for example, the description of the new embassy
                        compound in New Delhi makes one aware of how hard it is now to have the
                        kinds of experiences that came naturally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. Now it's almost impossible to get through the front door of
                    any embassy, and that is a great shame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is certainly another of the great changes, a
                        separation of the embassy as an institution and the persons within it from
                        the country in which it is located, and it seems to me as if that in and of
                        itself is diminishment of one of the most rewarding aspects of Foreign
                        Service life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>GREEN: The Service is diminished in other ways, too. Nowadays presidents and
                    chiefs of state pick up the phone and talk to each other and the embassy is
                    frequently cut out. Look at the President's speech last night; [Ed.: President
                    Ronald Reagan's televised address to the nation, March 4, 1987, dealing with the
                    question of arms for hostages] if you listen to it you come away with the
                    impression that foreign policy exclusively belongs to the President and the
                    National Security Council. There was not one word about the Secretary of State
                    or the State Department or the Foreign Service in a speech which was
                    fundamentally discussing foreign affairs. I fear we have been shunted to one
                    side and for many reasons—terrorism, instant communication, secretaries of state
                    who fly around the world, and special ambassadors who fly around the world. All
                    this diminishes the mission on the spot, and it is a great pity because the
                    mission on the spot has the people who know what's going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To return to the question of language, you yourself spoke
                        several languages from childhood fluently. Ambassador Green, obviously,
                        Japanese. I don't know what his other languages were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: French. He's equally fluent in French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So between you, you have four or five languages that you
                        can function in. Did you find when you were serving that most Foreign
                        Service couples could boast that many languages between them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think more of them boasted the language of the country rather than other
                    languages. For example, if you go to Japan so many of the embassy wives speak
                    excellent Japanese. I really was very much impressed by that, but I think
                    they're not as apt to speak, let's say, French or German or maybe even Spanish
                    which we consider more the world languages. But they do make a great effort to
                    learn the language of the country. In Indonesia everybody spoke Indonesian. I
                    studied Indonesian. I spoke it while I was there, just a basic form of the
                    language. Fortunately it is a very easy language, easy come, easy go. I
                    completely forgot about it afterwards. Korean, which is an extremely difficult
                    language, I studied very faithfully, and I never did learn any more than six
                    sentences, which was a great achievement and which I've gotten enormous mileage
                    out of for the rest of my life. You learn a lot about the people if you study
                    their language, and that's why I always made it a point to study the language.
                    Whether I learned it or not was sort of immaterial.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: First thing in the morning.</p>

                        a good deal of hard labor. When my husband and I were there, however, there
                        were very few wives who were in any way even interested, so I'm delighted to
                        hear what you say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, each one of my visits I always had both as my friend and/or control
                    officer's wife somebody who spoke marvelous Japanese. Lea Sneider, Mike
                    Shoesmith, Dorothy Emmerson—all those people were very comfortable in Japanese,
                    and I always admired them greatly for it. I wish to heaven I had learned it as a

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, that's a sore subject, as I was so longing to go. He was invited in
                    his capacity as ambassador to Australia. It was my life's dream to go to
                    Antarctica, but it's up to the local commander, and he said no wives. But my
                    husband went and had a wonderful time. It was over Christmas and New Year's, and
                    it was a great highlight in his life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He visited Australian installations there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, American. He was invited by the American government. He went in his
                    capacity as ambassador to Australia because both Australia and New Zealand have
                    interests there, and New Zealand is the jumping off place when you want to go to
                    Antarctica. We have a marvelous photograph of him standing on his head at the
                    South Pole, so you can turn the picture upside-down and he's holding the world
                    on his head like Atlas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful! But not only did these experiences on many
                        continents enliven your lives as far as Foreign Service officer and wife,
                        but certainly you must have met many and noted figures, some of whom must
                        remain in your mind, and had experiences of a different kind that also
                        remain in your mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, very much so. First of all, if I may just say that we regard the
                    absolute highlight of our Foreign Service life to be the trip to China with
                    President Nixon. My husband was one of the thirteen officials who accompanied
                    him on that original trip. And then he was flown directly to Japan in the
                    President's back-up plane on the first flight between China and Japan in 29
                    years. So he was dropped off in Japan as a presidential envoy to explain our new
                    China policy to each of the chiefs of government in fourteen countries of Asia
                    and Australasia. This was made easier by CINCPAC (Commander in Chief, Pacific)
                    giving us the use of a private plane. All heads of government wanted to know
                    quickly what went on in the Peking talks. And this would not have been nearly as
                    pleasant or as easy an assignment except for the fact that, being career people,
                    Marshall and I knew each of the heads of state we had to see. We knew them as
                    personal friends, and they trusted us. I couldn't help but think that, if a
                    political appointee had been assistant secretary at that time, he probably would
                    not have had these years of friendship to fall back on at a critical moment. It
                    was not easy to explain our turnabout in China policy, and old friendships
                    opened the necessary doors for Marshall. This in itself was a great and very
                    wonderful and very heartwarming experience.</p>
                <p>But just looking back over scattered moments in the Foreign Service, we really
                    have had some delightful experiences. One of the warmest experiences I had, and
                    it comes to mind because Governor Harriman [W. Averell Harriman] has recently
                    died, is when we were stationed in Hong Kong and we came home on home leave. At
                    the end of the home leave Marshall served on the Selection Board, which meant
                    that I had to take our then 12-year-old son back to Hong Kong to put him back
                    into his regular school, and then turn right around and come back to Washington
                    to be with Marshall for the next two or three months. So that was quite an
                    exhausting trip, as you can imagine—from Washington to Hong Kong and immediately
                    back. I found myself in the Newark airport at 2 o'clock in the morning
                    absolutely stunned with jet lag, when Governor Harriman stepped off an in-coming
                    plane. He was then in his eighties. He had woken up that morning in Texas. He
                    had given a series of speeches, had traveled all day, was exhausted and was
                    looking forward to going home. But when he saw me sitting there and found out
                    what a tremendous trip I'd had, he insisted on sitting with me and he said, “Now
                    don't you worry about a thing. I will get you on the next plane to Washington.”
                    Whereupon in the relief of knowing that I was being taken care of, I immediately
                    fell asleep on his shoulder. And true to his word, he took care of me for an
                    hour until my plane came. He lifted me bodily, woke me up and got me on the
                    plane, explained my situation to my seat mate and made her promise that she
                    would get me off the plane at Washington at 3:30 in the morning. I thought that
                    was such a nice thing for him to do, because, you know, many people think of him
                    as being aloof and austere, but he was a very kindly man and a warmly remembered
                    friend.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Then another almost sentimentally beautiful moment was in Papua New Guinea when
                    we had a very small dinner with the Australian High Commissioner and his wife in
                    honor of Lord Mountbatten, who had come to Papua New Guinea with the Queen and
                    Prince Philip who had then flown home, and he was to sail home on the Britannia.
                    We sat there on this mountaintop on a tropical evening, only ten of us, with the
                    flowers blooming and the beautifully lit-up royal yacht way below us in the
                    harbor. And there I was with one of the world's most attractive and exciting
                    men, and I had the opportunity to ask him all kinds of questions about World War
                    II that I had always wondered about, such as: Would the history of the world
                    have been different if he had been allowed to bring in his forces immediately
                    after V-J Day instead of having to wait those two weeks that General MacArthur
                    required in order to sign the Armistice first. And so here was this historic
                    moment—and I do love history—when I could ask one of the great leaders of World
                    War II about various things. So I always remember that as being a very wonderful
                    and unusually pleasant experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he in his response to your questions as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, very open and charming and delightful. I couldn't have asked for more.
                    It was wonderful. Somewhat along that vein, when we were in Paris for the
                    Vietnam peace talks I had the great pleasure of sitting on the right of the Duke
                    of Windsor at a very small dinner. And when he found out how much I loved
                    history and how well versed I was in his own family affairs, he insisted on
                    talking to me for the next three hours after dinner. He refused to separate men
                    from women after dinner. And the very next day he sent over an autographed copy
                    of his autobiography. And then the secretary called up and said that the Duke
                    and Duchess would like to give a dinner for us, and I was dying to go so that I
                    could see the furnishings in the house, many of which he had taken over from the
                    palaces in England, such as Fort Belvedere and so on, and I was just counting
                    the days, and would you believe, we got transferred the week before! President
                    Nixon came to Paris and at that point appointed Marshall as Assistant Secretary
                    and we had to leave immediately. But that was a special moment.</p>
                <p>Oh, yes, and when we were in New Zealand, which was the immediate post-war
                    period, we had the only—and of course it was a pre-war—convertible Buick in the
                    country. Because it was the only convertible in the country, when Lord
                    Montgomery came to make his triumphal tour of the country, the New Zealand
                    government asked to borrow our rather elderly car. It had gone all through World
                    War II, and Lord Montgomery traveled the length and breadth of the country in
                    our car. Everybody knew it was our car because it is a very small country and
                    everybody knows everything. So we got an autographed photograph of it, and then
                    when we came to sell the car later on we sold it at an excellent price because
                    everybody knew that that was the car that had carried Lord Montgomery. So that
                    was rather fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>When we were in Korea, President Eisenhower came to visit. That was a bit
                    difficult because he had planned to only spend eight hours in Korea, with a very
                    limited entourage, and spend the night in Tokyo. But you may remember that there
                    were stormy anti-American demonstrations at that time which prevented his going
                    there at the very last minute. So suddenly here we were in a Korea that had not
                    yet recovered from the war, without a Korean Head of State (because Premier Rhee
                    had just been ousted) faced with a visiting American president who was going to
                    spend the night with his entire 250-member entourage and no hotels equal to the
                    occasion. So we really had to make do with what we had. We all farmed our
                    children out to the military to release beds in the embassy compounds for the
                    visitors. The Science Advisor to the President simply commandeered our house and
                    said that he was inviting thirty people for lunch that very same day. I had to
                    make an eight mile round trip to the military commissary just to buy the basic
                    necessities of food, and we really had quite a scramble doing this for him and
                    we never even got a world of thanks afterwards. But the President himself—of
                    course it was a privilege to meet him—addressed the American community and we
                    were very glad that he was able to come. But it was an example of how you can
                    make do if you have to with very little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was hoping you would speak about the visit to wherever
                        it may have been of a high-ranking official. What was your role, your own
                        role in this, even as this was an extraordinary experience obviously? Was it
                        your responsibility to arrange among other of the wives who were there how
                        this was going to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes. We had to find beds for everybody; we had to provide meals for
                    everybody; transportation for everybody. We all had to pitch in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine that it must have been very difficult, and
                        in that case it must have been very helpful to have had a group of wives who
                        were not only willing and able but capable of doing what was necessary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, well, we've always been blessed with congenial, helpful Foreign
                    Service wives. And as I say, we all farmed our children out to the military base
                    so that we could have the necessary beds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did this emergency situation continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Just twenty-four hours. Of course they put in White House telephones in
                    all our houses during the visit, and when we saw off the presidential visit at
                    the airport, we all raced home in hopes of calling up our loved ones on this
                    White House line. But they were all torn out during that short period that we
                    were out of the house. So we never got to even use the telephone.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also had some close association earlier with Mr.
                        Nixon, not then president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. He came to visit us in 1967 as a private citizen. He had
                    been Vice President but was not seen as a likely president. He made an excellent
                    impression because, unlike most famous people, he did not come with a lot of
                    aides. He just came by himself. And also unlike most official visitors, he was a
                    wonderful listener. He came to learn and to hear, and he was really a remarkable
                    person, and we were very surprised at how much we admired him. He and Marshall
                    sat up until two o'clock in the morning discussing Indonesia, Southeast Asia and
                    a possible re-opening of our relations with China. He was well informed and had
                    an open mind. During all his conversations in Jakarta, he took copious notes on
                    his famous yellow legal pads. He made a good impression on the Indonesians and
                    they on him. In fact, he developed a soft spot in his heart for Indonesia. It
                    was a very successful visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I can't remember now. About two or three days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Long enough, in other words. Was that his first visit
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: As far as I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Perhaps you personally took him around when he wasn't
                        closeted with Marshall Green?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, and of course we gave dinners and lunches for him so that he
                    could meet all the interesting people. But I couldn't help but contrast that
                    with the visit of Vice President Humphrey which was just about the same time or
                    the same year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also to Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>GREEN: Also to Indonesia. We were devoted to Vice President Humphrey. He was the
                    nicest, kindest man in the world, but he did all the talking. He was famous for
                    that. Also, he brought with him a group of aides, who would not be guided by our
                    protocol. They insisted on their own seating of the official dinner, with the
                    result that the dean of the diplomatic corps told us later that only his warm
                    personal friendship for America prevented him from getting up and leaving the
                    dinner. And there were a number of hard feelings because they would not be
                    guided by us. On the other hand, Hubert Humphrey was of great help to my husband
                    in fighting our battles in Washington.</p>
                <p>Another vivid recollection relates to our earlier days in Sweden attending the
                    Nobel Prize festivities. Only the embassies of winning countries are ever
                    invited, and fortunately America has had winners ever since they began, and so
                    the American embassy is always invited. That is, only the ambassador and maybe
                    two or three other couples, and he tries to rotate it. We went in 1951 which was
                    the year that Winston Churchill won, which was marvelous except for the fact
                    that he couldn't come because he was at the Bermuda Conference with President
                    Eisenhower. But Lady Churchill and their daughter Mary Soames came.</p>
                <p>Just to see the Nobel Prize is a great thing. You start off in your black tie and
                    evening dress at three in the afternoon in the Concert House of Stockholm for
                    the actual awarding of the prizes, and then you move directly from there to the
                    Town Hall, to the Gold Mosaic Room, a very thrilling place, for the dinner, the
                    banquet, which lasts, along with singing from the students and so on, until well
                    past midnight. So you can see it's a very long day. And there are 600 people
                    sitting down at the banquet. It took me about three hours to find my husband
                    afterwards. But I was thrilled to be able to go at least once to that glittering
                    event.</p>
                <p>Another great moment in Sweden was having our youngest child born. We arrived in
                    Sweden in October and I went straight to the doctor and said, “I'm having a baby
                    the end of March. Please make the necessary hospital arrangements.” And he said,
                    “Don't be ridiculous. That's when all the mid-summer babies are born and there's
                    no way I can get you into a hospital.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so where was the baby born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: And so he was born right in my own bed at home without benefit of
                    anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were alone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was absolutely alone. I called up the doctor, and he arrived about 45
                    minutes later, but I was alone those 45 minutes, and by that time the baby was
                    born. So that's my little Swedish boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He must have a particular place in your family
                        chronicles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was fun because his two brothers, then 6 and 8, when they got up for
                    breakfast the next morning, there was a brand new baby, and they never knew how
                    it got there. So that was rather fun.</p>
                <p>One of my own particular highlights in which I think I helped the U.S. government
                    perhaps more than any other moment was when we were taking a trip to Southeast
                    Asia [Ed.: in 1971] when Marshall was Assistant Secretary, and we were
                    accompanying the Deputy Secretary of State who had his daughter along, but he
                    was a widower so he did not have a wife with him, which meant that I was the
                    ranking woman. When we were in Cambodia we stayed at the Guest House where we
                    drank bottles of Evian water which turned out to be water from the Mekong River.
                    The result was that we were all deathly ill for the rest of the trip. And in
                    Laos Prince Souvanna Phouma naturally gave a welcoming dinner for us and I found
                    myself sitting on Prince Souvanna Phouma's right, with the Deputy Secretary on
                    his left at the head of a T-shaped table with everybody else down the full
                    length of the table, which meant that the three of us could not talk to the rest
                    of them. It then turned out that the Deputy Secretary of State did not speak one
                    single word of French. Prince Souvanna Phouma did not speak a word of English,
                    so here I was, still very ill from the Mekong River water, as we all were,
                    couldn't eat anything, couldn't drink anything, and for the next three hours I
                    had to be the sole interpreter between these two notables. And the conversation
                    was very technical because the Indochina war was raging, and it was all about
                    Laotian military requirements. Here I had to summon my last remaining threads of
                    strength to interpret for three solid hours, I really felt that I had done
                    something for my country and I was proud to have had the opportunity. The
                    ironical footnote to that story is that our Deputy Secretary of State was made
                    ambassador to France, still not speaking a word of French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope in the interval between those two events he was at
                        least able to thank you for what you had done in the way ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, barely. But anyway, that's one of the things in the Foreign Service
                    that you never know what you're going to be asked to do, and I was thrilled to
                    have this opportunity and Prince Souvanna Phouma spoke the most beautiful French
                    I've ever heard in my life. He spoke French as Winston Churchill spoke English.
                    It was a rare privilege and I was thrilled to pieces to be part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should think that must have been a marvelous
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It really was. Something I'll never forget, and I was awfully glad that I
                    was able to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your languages have stood you in very good stead
                        because I'm aware that you also had an opportunity probably to converse with
                        Olaf Palme in Swedish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes, yes. Oh that was the most exciting dinner of all. That was the
                    White House dinner given by President and Mrs. Nixon to honor the 25th
                    anniversary of the United Nations. And they had at that dinner 38 heads of
                    government. The only Americans present were the cabinet and the five geographic
                    Assistant Secretaries to help with their particular client guests. And so here I
                    was, sitting between the Prime Ministers of Sweden and England, with the Prime
                    Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, as the next woman up the table. So I thought
                    that was pretty exciting and I did speak Swedish to Prime Minister Palme. Of
                    course I'm very saddened by his assassination last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say a little bit about your conversations with
                        him. He was reputed himself to have been a most charming table companion
                        and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh he was. He was a delightful intellectual person, and like most Swedes,
                    he warmed up the minute he found out that we had lived in Sweden, because that
                    makes a big difference to Swedes. No, I can't remember our actual conversation.
                    This was back in the early 1970s. But it was simply exciting to talk to Prime
                    Minister Heath and Golda Meir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who has just, after all, lost out as being Chancellor of
                        Oxford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Chancellor of Oxford. Yes, I was sorry about that, although I think
                    Roy Jenkins is a top-notch person. So that was a very exciting dinner, and then
                    after dinner I found Emperor Haile Selassie standing very much by himself, as he
                    did not speak English, so I made so bold as to go up to him and speak to him in
                    French, and I think he was quite glad to be able to chat with somebody. He was a
                    very remarkable man. He had the most piercing eyes I've ever seen in my life. I
                    had met him in Sweden before on a state visit, and then I met him again at this
                    White House dinner. I've always been struck by the depth of his eyes. They could
                    see right through you; they were very soulful eyes. So that was very exciting to
                    me to meet all these remarkable people that one reads about. I thought again how
                    lucky I was, and how only being in the Foreign Service made all these wonderful
                    things possible for us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those moments, hours, days, obviously will stay in your
                        mind forever. There probably were times in your experience, as long as it
                        was, that were not quite as rewarding in the same fashion, and there were
                        probably some other experiences that were very definitely a good deal less
                        rewarding and unhappy. I think, of course, of the McCarthy period and its
                        effect on the Foreign Service in general. You and Marshall Green were in
                        Washington at the beginning of the McCarthy period when I think he was Far
                        Eastern Desk Officer at the time and during the time that you were in
                        Sweden.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, well of course it's unquestionable that that was the darkest period
                    in the whole history of the Foreign Service. I'm convinced of it. I think of
                    course many people have forgotten about it now, but I think the insidious
                    influence will be with us almost forever. It was really a terrible time. Senator
                    McCarthy, out of a sense of pure self-aggrandizement and to try to make a name
                    for himself in Congress, decided to start a witch hunt against the Foreign
                    Service, particularly against the China hands on the perfectly ridiculous charge
                    that they had lost China, as though China were ours to lose. It really was a
                    very frightening and terrible time. We were in the Far Eastern Bureau which was
                    of course the hardest hit. We were Japan officers rather than China officers,
                    which was the only thing that saved us. But our China friends were suffering
                    very much and dropping by the wayside. All of us were under great scrutiny, not
                    only for the reports that had been written but what organizations had one
                    belonged to in school and college. Marshall frequently had to write letters of
                    character reference for other people in the Bureau. And it was a time when you
                    really didn't know who to trust and who not to trust. It was a very frightening
                    time.</p>
                <p>Our particular friend Jack Service, who had been assigned to India, was taken off
                    the ship and brought back in mid-journey to testify before McCarthy. Marshall
                    was the only person who had the courage to go down to the airport and meet him,
                    for which I have always admired him, and we brought him home to our own house to
                    stay, and then he stayed with other close friends, too. But most of our friends
                    didn't even wish to be seen with anybody under a shadow, which is really a very
                    sad commentary. I used to go down to the hearings every single day and write a
                    very detailed account to send his poor distraught wife who was still on the
                    ship, and eventually in India for a year's separation as it turned out. And so I
                    would write her all these accounts and simply because the back of my head was
                    photographed with Jack Service and Senator McCarthy in one of the newspapers,
                    even my aunt and uncle said, “Where there's smoke there's fire.” We must be
                    Communists! Just to be there! That was the kind of atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that extension well beyond Washington—the
                        appreciation by the country, if one can put it in that term—of what was
                        going on was such that people became known perhaps nationally in a way that
                        they might not otherwise have been known. The attention that was focused on
                        those hearings and the extension of guilt by association was extraordinary.
                        I think it's very difficult to recreate that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I don't think people nowadays realize how that poison spread. Many of
                    us in the Foreign Service contributed to an anonymous fund to help people like
                    Jack Service, John Davies, John Carter Vincent and the other people who were so
                    unfairly pilloried. We all contributed, and I begged my parents to
                    contribute—after all, my father was in the Foreign Service for about thirty
                    years—but they wouldn't. I frankly never got over that. I thought that was a
                    terrible thing, but that's how many people in the Foreign Service felt. They
                    were so intimidated they didn't want to have anything to do with it. Anyway, it
                    was a very black and dreadful time.</p>
                <p>About halfway through that period we were sent to Sweden, and a year or so later
                    Senator McCarthy sent his two henchmen, Roy Cohn and David Schine, who were then
                    in their twenties. The word jerk, if you'll excuse me, is the only word that
                    comes to mind. Here were these two young jerks, traveling all over Europe, going
                    to every embassy, gathering the entire staff from the ambassador on down, and
                    lecturing us on the importance of patriotism. We in the Foreign Service who had
                    devoted our lives to patriotic service, including our ambassadors having to
                    listen to this, all because of the terrible climate of fear. It was a
                    humiliating and dreadful experience. The host countries knew all about it and
                    they were perfectly horrified. And frankly we feel that that whole exercise,
                    that whole period of McCarthyism, ruined our nation's standing before the world.
                    We were the magnanimous victors of World War II. We were the rebuilders and
                    enlightened occupiers, and the home of democracy—all those things we had stood
                    for were stained perhaps forever by this dreadful man who did it purely out of a
                    sense of making a name for himself.</p>
                <p>Jack Service was sitting at the witness table. I was sitting back in the shadows
                    unnoticed when Senator McCarthy came in. He came right over to Jack, slapped him
                    on the shoulder and said, “Don't take any of this personally.” And here was
                    Jack's life being ruined, as was John Carter Vincent's and John Davies' and the
                    others. And by his own admission Senator McCarthy didn't believe what he was
                    saying. He said, “Don't take any of this personally.” It was just a political
                    gambit as far as he was concerned. That makes it all the more wicked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes indeed. It seems unforgivable in any context, I think,
                        today. You had close associations with not only Caroline Service but with
                        other of the wives. The families suffered a great deal in that period, and
                        you must have had a great appreciation of the problems and difficulties that
                        the families of the men particularly affected underwent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it was terrible for all concerned. Some of them had children who had
                    breakdowns, and had difficulties in school, and sometimes the parents had a hard
                    time getting apartments to rent, or other jobs because of this feeling. We were
                    deeply grateful that we were able to survive that thin-ice period. It was only
                    by the grace of God that we were saved.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you thought that the McCarthy period carried
                        with it a change in feeling for the image of America. Did you see and hear
                        any of those changes as they were happening? In Sweden, did the press there
                        report on the McCarthy hearings as they went forward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Very much so. There were editorials, and this was true all over Europe.
                    The feeling was just generally one of shock and surprise that America should
                    find itself hostage to such a despicable man. It was also saddening to see how
                    McCarthyism affected people's courage in writing reports, a feeling that you had
                    to write what people wanted to hear. You were taking your career in your hands
                    if you told the truth as you saw it. That, of course, is a great handicap to a
                    government. People must feel free to speak the truth as they see it. I think
                    there is a bit of McCarthyism today with Senator Helms. One is hesitant to
                    affront Helms and the ultra-right, particularly if one is up for an appointment
                    which Helms can block.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think there has been a—shall I say at least so
                        far—a pale return of that atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. The knowledge that your nomination can be held up almost indefinitely
                    if you don't have the right views on things like anti-communism, population
                    control and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing that struck me in looking over the period that
                        was for such a long time Ambassador Green's and your particular interest and
                        responsibility: As with the climate of the McCarthy period, one forgets
                        rather easily the influence of Communist China in Southeast Asia. During
                        that same period and preceding by a number of years, of course, American
                        participation in that period in a military sense in Vietnam. There were
                        changes of government in Ceylon and Indonesia, in Korea, Malaysia, all of
                        those areas Ambassador Green's responsibility professionally for most of his
                        career. And you were of course with him in Indonesia at a very turbulent
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, indeed yes. The country was sliding more and more into communism.
                    Their only friends when we arrived were Pyongyang, Hanoi and Peking. This
                    worried the Indonesian Army leaders because they were not communistically
                    inclined, although Sukarno was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>GREEN: '65, that's right. We arrived in the summer at a time when our relations
                    were absolutely at their nadir, and my husband was hanging in effigy on the main
                    street. For the first year we were there few Indonesians would speak to us.
                    There were signs all over saying “Green Go Home.” Luckily some of the signs had
                    in small writing underneath, “And take me with you.” So that we always felt that
                    it was the government of the time that was against America, but the people of
                    the country were very warmly disposed towards us. Because even when we drove
                    along the streets and had our flags flying, truckloads of students going to
                    anti-American rallies would all smile and wave to us in a most friendly way. So
                    we never felt that the country was against us. And then finally the day came
                    when Sukarno and the communists assassinated seven of the top generals which led
                    to an upheaval that eventually resulted in the Army ousting Sukarno and the
                    communists. It was a very dicey period but the new leadership was sensible. They
                    made economic development and good relations with neighboring countries the key
                    objectives. We've been very good friends ever since. But we were there at a very
                    crucial time when it could have gone the other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it not from there that you were evacuated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, yes it was because there was a lot of bloodshed during that period.
                    In fact nobody knows exactly how many people were killed—anything from 100,000
                    to half a million were killed on the grounds that the victim was a communist,
                    but of course nobody knows, and probably a lot of personal grudges were being
                    paid off that way. But it was a very bloodthirsty time, no question about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that evacuation planned and executed? Did you have
                        anything to do with the arrangements for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, none at all. That's something the embassy does entirely. As it
                    happened, I was already at home and putting my youngest son in school and I was
                    then forbidden to return to Indonesia. At that time the rest of the families
                    were given the opportunity to go anywhere they wanted. Some went to Australia,
                    some went to Malaysia, some went to Bangkok, some came to America. They had
                    their choice. As I was already here I simply had to stay until I was allowed
                    back in, which was just in time for Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was then for how long? Several months?</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GREEN: Four years. All our posts have been long posts. We stayed almost five
                    years in Sweden, four years in Indonesia. We could have stayed four years in
                    Australia, but we only stayed two years, because Marshall developed a great
                    interest in population problems and he wanted to start up an office in the State
                    Department to concern itself with these matters, which he did. It's also
                    something that he's been able to pursue in private life since retirement, which
                    is why he started it in the government because he wanted to get them interested
                    in it before he himself retired. And now he does it on a sort of a
                    quasi-government basis as a consultant to primarily AID because AID is more
                    interested in population matters, although Marshall did start the office in the
                    State Department and for four years he was the chairman of the inter-agency task
                    force on population consisting of eighteen U.S. government agencies. He was also
                    head of the U.S. delegation to the UN Population Commission.</p>

                        and certainly the record has shown since, that Ambassador Green was one of

                    then he was ambassador to Burma and Australia. But he was never anything less
                    than that. So he was not strictly speaking a career ambassador. And Nelson

                        recollections of the two Secretaries of State and their wives with whom you
                        had particular associations during the time that he was Assistant Secretary.
                        I think many people don't really know a great deal about what the
                        relationship might be between the wife of an Assistant Secretary of State
                        and the wife of the Secretary of State. Would you talk a little bit about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, well actually it's quite a close relationship. Let me put it this
                    way: The wife of the geographic Assistant Secretary is the Secretary's wife's
                    advisor on those particular countries and those particular visitors. Therefore
                    any time anybody came from any of our sixteen countries to America, then I would
                    be invited to assist the wife, whether it be Mrs. Rusk or Mrs. Rogers, to assist
                    them in their entertainment plan, their schedule, be with them, be a sort of an
                    aide to the official visitors of our client countries. So I would see Mrs. Rusk
                    or Mrs. Rogers a great deal during any visit of anybody from the Far East. And
                    then when the Rogers went to the Far East we would go with them, and presumably
                    I would know more people out there than she would and then I would introduce her
                    and help her and just be a general assistant. So we (I mean we the other wives
                    and I, the geographic wives and I) would go very often to her house and plan all
                    the visits and plan all kinds of things that we did together. So it was quite a
                    close association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it must have been. How were those plans
                        carried out; that is to say, did you have other wives on whom you could in
                        turn depend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, Protocol would carry it out. We were there simply to provide advice
                    and ideas, and then they would decide which, or at least Mrs. Rogers would
                    decide what she wanted done and Protocol would carry it out. But we would be
                    there as sort of a lady-in-waiting you might say with ideas and advice and
                    assistance and just to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both Mrs. Rusk and Mrs. Rogers, of course, had very close
                        associations with the Foreign Service women in their Association, and I
                        think both of them are remembered with great affection, and, I imagine that
                        you also shared that feeling of warmth and friendliness that they
                        conveyed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh very much so. Virginia Rusk gave me a beautifully inscribed book when
                    our association came to an end, which I thought was a very thoughtful thing for
                    her to do. Marshall played golf and bridge with Secretary Rogers and they
                    lunched together a great deal. We all saw a lot of each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I wonder if I might just put in here a very kind thing that President Nixon did
                    for us. That is, at the last White House dinner we attended just before we went
                    out to Australia, knowing this would be our last dinner there, this was an
                    official dinner for Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore, so naturally
                    we were invited—the Nixons were extra kind to invite us upstairs in the private
                    quarters to have drinks, just with the Nixons, the Rogers, the Vice President,
                    and Lee Kuan Yew. And we sat there for about forty-five minutes, just having
                    quiet family drinks and chatting and having such a nice time, and of course it
                    was the only time in my life I have seen the upstairs of the White House, or
                    ever expect to. Then came the great moment when the Flourishes and Ruffles
                    sounded and the Nixons and the Lee Kuan Yews walked down the grand staircase
                    with us following behind. That was a great moment in my life to be able to walk
                    down the great staircase of the White House. And I've always thought that was a
                    really thoughtful thing for President Nixon to do. Here he was in the throes of
                    Watergate. This was the spring of '73 when everything was about to break, and he
                    looked very drawn and exhausted and worn out and worried, and still he thought
                    to invite us upstairs, which I thought was a most considerate thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed it must have been an indication of his high regard
                        for both of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll always be grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had an opportunity to see Mrs. Nixon at that time
                        then. Had you known her before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Just to shake hands at many occasions because we went there often. We not
                    only went for all the dinners for our client countries, but we went to the
                    Christmas parties for the sub-cabinet, and we went to the Sunday church
                    services. We were invited very often during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I had reflected on since our
                        earlier conversation: you spoke, of course, of many of the changes you've
                        observed in the years that you've been in the Foreign Service, and of course
                        preceding that when you were an observer as a younger person. One of the
                        things that has interested me is your comment about the swelling of the
                        Foreign Service after World War II in particular. In the context of the
                        changes brought about by the Wriston program and the people who entered the
                        Service as officers laterally, did you find that that group of people, not
                        only officers but their wives as well, brought new points of view to the
                        Foreign Service, perhaps those with whom you may not wholly have agreed but
                        nonetheless made considerable changes in attitudes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GREEN: I wish I could feel more charitably inclined toward the Wriston program,
                    but it was a very hard thing when career people had worked five, ten, fifteen
                    years to have these outsiders come in ahead of them and some of them were really
                    quite incompetent. I know many a person who came in ahead of us who never ever
                    got promoted again and who eventually were selected out. I mean it was a mixture
                    that really should not have taken place, because I think the people who were
                    civil service in the State Department were that out of choice because they
                    didn't want to join the Foreign Service. And the Foreign Service were in the
                    Foreign Service out of choice because they didn't want to be civil servants in
                    the Department. And then to have this forced marriage I don't think was any
                    happier for them than it was for us because some of them must have felt like
                    fish out of water. They also incurred some resentment from the FSO's. I don't
                    think it was a good idea. I just put it as bluntly as that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that increase your responsibilities as the wife of a
                        high-ranking embassy official, for example, in the necessity obviously to
                        provide for these newcomers instruction of one kind or another which they
                        probably were grateful to have and needed badly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think they could be singled out for instruction; I think that came
                    naturally in the monthly wives' meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had a great deal to do with those...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, in all posts we had very active monthly wives' meetings, and then
                    they had the opportunity of asking questions of things that they didn't know at
                    those meetings. So that was the easier and more tactful way to handle it, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, in the course of the time that you were in the
                        Foreign Service you saw a change in the character of representation and
                        spoke about it. It came to include participation in many charitable events
                        and many charitable activities that perhaps were not necessarily activities
                        that were carried out in earlier fears, say, by your mother and those who
                        were in the Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I don't remember that my parents or their generation did anything in
                    the way of local charities. I'm not aware of it. As you know, I have put out a
                    book of my parents' letters, and they never mentioned anything about bazaars or
                    bake sales or any of the sort of standard charitable things that we do
                    nowadays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When do you think that change began to occur?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>GREEN: I think after World War II because there were many countries in great
                    need. Third World countries were in great need at that point. The colonial
                    empires had disappeared, the new countries usually poverty-stricken and often
                    war-torn and they needed a good deal of help. And we were giving Marshall Plan
                    and other aid around the world. In that situation, charity work came
                    naturally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course there were many new countries that were created
                        in areas that perhaps were in immediate need of assistance of various kinds
                        where the expertise and freer time of a diplomatic woman could be put to
                        good use.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: In places with large American communities we wanted to reach out to them
                    and make them feel part of it because so often the embassies used to hold
                    themselves aloof, which I don't think is a good idea. We worked very hard. For
                    example, in Korea there was a very large missionary colony there, very large
                    indeed, as there was in Papua New Guinea and other places. And they had always
                    been rather ignored by the embassy. When Marshall was charg� d'affaires there he
                    made it a point to invite all the missionaries who cared to come, and give them
                    a thorough briefing because after all we had two revolutions while we were
                    there. The political situation was very iffy and difficult, and he felt it was
                    only fair and right to brief them and to explain to them what the situation was,
                    what they could expect, what we were doing about it, and so on. I heard that
                    that had not been done before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Ambassador Green ever arrange the same kinds of
                        briefings for business groups, American business groups either in Korea
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes, but they hadn't been as left out, perhaps, as the missionary
                    group, which is why I mention the missionary group. But certainly the business
                    group. We tried to keep all the American community under the same umbrella to
                    show that we were all there together and facing things together, and we wanted
                    to share what information and what help we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have spoken earlier about the representation that you
                        participated in vis-a-vis the American community generally, and have said
                        that you felt that this was a very important part of any embassy activity.
                        You spoke particularly about Hong Kong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Tremendous business community there, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that most embassies still find that their
                        major representational activities tend to be in the direction of Americans,
                        either visiting or resident in wherever the capitol may be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>GREEN: I wouldn't say it was most, because after all your primary interest is the
                    host country and the host government. But I'm just saying that it is a large
                    part that has often been overlooked, which is the only reason I raised the
                    subject at all, because it often has been overlooked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to say a little bit about you as a person. I
                        have been fascinated in the time that we've been talking to think of the
                        transformation that has taken place in your life that one might almost say
                        is comparable to the transformation of a person whose name we mentioned at
                        the very beginning of the interview, the transformation of Kathleen
                        Beauchamp into Katherine Mansfield, and the transformation of you as not yet
                        eighteen-year old Lispenard Crocker into now Lisa Green, and all that that
                        implies. How was it possible that you charted your own course in a way that
                        seems to me to be so individual and so strong from the very beginning. Do
                        you think that, for example, your school—we talked about St. Timothy's—had
                        any bearing at all on the way in which you shaped your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I suppose everything has its input, but as I look back on my Foreign
                    Service life (and my very first memory is my third birthday which was just
                    arriving in Budapest), I enjoyed it all while it lasted. But when I was thirteen
                    years old I came to the realization that really I should know more about my own
                    country, that I'd only seen the United States for sixty days on alternating
                    summers. And that really wasn't enough. I didn't know what other people talked
                    about or thought about and I really felt a sudden and deep need to know America
                    better. So I realized the only way I could get home was to ask to be sent to
                    boarding school, because my parents were stationed in Japan and were going to be
                    there for several more years and that was really the only way I could get home.
                    So I can remember going into their room one day saying, “I want to go to
                    boarding school next year, next school year.”</p>
                <p>They sent me home to a school where a lot of my Crocker cousins had gone. And
                    indeed I was very much a fish out of water. I was in St. Timothy's from the age
                    of fourteen to seventeen. I didn't know any of the jokes or current stories or
                    anything that anybody else knew. I knew no boys from boys' schools. I'd never
                    been to a dance, I just simply was a fish out of water, and I suppose those
                    three years did a great deal to soften my edges. I knew a lot of things they
                    didn't know, including languages, and it was an interesting experience. I was
                    happy there. I made friends for life—still have my St. Timothy friends—and they
                    really did a good job in teaching me how to be an American. Anyway I was
                    thrilled to pieces to be back in America, and I've never lost that feeling of
                    how wonderful it is to be in America. I'm always thankful to heaven when I am
                    here because I have lived abroad so much. In fact, looking back now I've lived
                    seventeen years inEurope and seventeen years in the Far East. So that's really a
                    good chunk of my life.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>And then after school I was going to go to college but happily I met Marshall and
                    I married him instead. We married six weeks after Pearl Harbor. He joined the
                    Navy even though he had already passed the Foreign Service written exams. We
                    spent the next four years with him being a Japanese translator and having two
                    children, and then the minute the war was over he was back in the Foreign
                    Service and we went immediately to New Zealand, which I have mentioned as being
                    a great fun and beautiful place to be. Then we had three years in Washington on
                    the Japan desk, Northeast Asia desk. Then we went to Sweden for almost five
                    years.</p>
                <p>I can't let the Swedish part go by without mentioning a very fine moment I had
                    there, and that is that the old king died shortly after we arrived, and the new
                    king was King Gustav the Sixth Adolph. When a new king ascends the throne in
                    Sweden, he will go once to dinner at the leading embassies and never again
                    during his reign. So we were lucky to be there when he came to the American
                    embassy for dinner. Our Ambassador, Walt Butterworth, wanted to have a
                    completely American meal so we had cream of corn soup and lobster and roast
                    turkey. And the Ambassador asked me as a special favor to make fudge for the
                    King of Sweden. So I made batch after batch of fudge and got all my friends to
                    try all the little broken edge pieces to see which was my absolutely finest
                    batch. I produced it, and when it came to be served at dinner the Ambassador
                    very kindly turned to the King and said Mrs. Green had made the fudge for him.
                    Well, the King had a very great sweet tooth because he neither drank nor smoked,
                    and he loved the fudge, and on the strength of that I was invited up to be the
                    first person to speak to him after dinner, because of course with royalty you do
                    not go up to them; you wait until you are taken. And so that was just sort of an
                    amusing thing that all my friends have always teased me about ever since. My
                    fudge was royal tested!</p>
                <p>Anyway, to go back to the general scheme of things, after Sweden we came back to
                    the National War College, which was a wonderful year, and we made marvelous
                    friends that have stood us in good stead ever since, because they were friends
                    in the military as well as in our own service. And then Marshall was Regional
                    Planning Advisor for East Asia for three years and we traveled a good deal
                    through the Far East and made so many of these friends who stayed with us
                    forever more. We were going to go to Saigon as DCM, but at the last moment we
                    went to Korea as DCM, which was a very, very exciting time to be there because
                    it was shortly after the war.</p>
                <p>Shortly after our arrival the Syngman Rhee revolution took place and then the
                    Park Chung Hee revolution which were times of great stress for all concerned,
                    and the Koreans have always appreciated Marshall's role in their revolution,
                    because he tried to uphold the democratic principle and so he's part of their
                    history books, and we're frequently invited back to Korea, and it's a very
                    heartwarming association.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Then we went to Hong Kong for two years as Consul General, and in those days that
                    was our fourth largest mission in the world (in terms of Foreign Service
                    officers) which is hard to realize now, because it took the place of the Peking
                    Embassy and all the consulates that we now have, but in those days it was the
                    China-watching place, and I think to this day that they have very highly
                    qualified China watchers. Then after that we came back as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary and then four years in Indonesia as Ambassador and then back for four
                    years as Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and then two
                    years in Australia and then after that Marshall came home, as I say, and started
                    his work in population in the State Department, and he's been doing that ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>When he retired in 1979 I decided to follow my own interests and since then I
                    have worked half the week at our local hospital as a nursing assistant. People
                    think that that's a very different sort of thing from being the wife of an
                    ambassador. But it's extraordinary how my Foreign Service life has made it
                    easier for me to be a nursing assistant, and that is, it has enabled me to talk
                    very easily and comfortably with any kind of person whatsoever. I can
                    immediately establish a rapport with patients and this has been remarked upon by
                    the head nurse and the others how quickly I can find a point of contact with any
                    patient, and I keep saying to them, “Well, it's because I spent my life in the
                    Foreign Service. I've always been trained...” So often you only meet a person
                    just very briefly and you have to be able to find some point of contact very
                    quickly. So I credit my life in the Foreign Service very much for making it
                    easier for me to do my job now working in a hospital. So even though it may seem
                    strange, it works together.</p>

                        explanation I can visualize more easily how this could have come about.
                        Nonetheless, I am struck by the strong drive that you must have felt
                        because, in the first place, as you describe it, on your own
                        initiative...leaving home to come to the United States.</hi>

                <p>GREEN: At thirteen, and I never lived under the parental roof again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think very few, if any, thirteen-year-olds that I can

                        That's an indication certainly of a very independent personality, it seems
                        to me. Where in the Foreign Service—because of course as you said several
                        times you began very early at a young age to have your overseas
                        experience—did you find people with whom you served who helped you,
                        reinforced your feelings of service to your country, and service to the post
                        where you found yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, that was so deeply ingrained. After all, I was born in the Service,
                    went to my first post at the age of four weeks, and I can remember all my
                    childhood my father hiding documents under my mattress or under my pillow. So
                    that public service was the most deeply ingrained thing that I had, and my
                    husband felt the same way.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that most Foreign Service officers, and their
                        wives, for most of the time that you were in active service shared your
                        feelings about the Foreign Service and their appreciation of the values of
                        this country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so, yes, I think so. I do feel that all our Foreign Service
                    colleagues are very deeply committed people to both the country and to public
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of public service, I am reminded of a comment
                        that your mother wrote in a letter that struck me sufficiently so that I
                        have it with me now. She wrote describing her personal feeling about a
                        woman—a Bolshevik diplomat who interested her very much and whom she would
                        have liked to meet. But of course, as she writes in her letter, that was an
                        impossibility. Then the United States and Communist Russia were not on
                        speaking diplomatic terms. But she writes further, “It just proves again
                        that once you are a diplomat, you cease utterly to be a person in any
                        private sense. It is your country, right or wrong, which is your outer
                        covering.” That's a rather strong statement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I don't think you stop being your own person one minute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the things that has interested me particularly
                        in our conversation because indeed I have the impression that your private
                        person is fully as strongly developed as the public one that you have showed
                        so successfully over all these years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think it was true that my mother was totally dedicated to the
                    Foreign Service, and she lived, breathed and died for it, so I can quite see her
                    writing those words. Of course she only had one child, but I had three, so I
                    perhaps had to spend more time in the family sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I know you did was to serve from
                        time to time on a panel that was set up in Washington to give good advice to
                        new wives going into the Foreign Service. On one occasion you rather
                        startled not only the panel but your audience as a whole with the response
                        that you made.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>GREEN: [That was] at the Foreign Service Institute. Yes. Well, that was sort of
                    an amusing moment. A practical one, too. We were three people on the panel. I
                    was the junior member. At the end of the two-week discussion—our morning
                    discussions—the chairman said that she would like to hear from each of the panel
                    members what they thought was the most important thing to know in the Foreign
                    Service. The first person said, “Oh, you must be loyal to your flag and to your
                    ambassador, your country.” And the second panelist grimly said, “Oh, you must
                    have a wonderful sense of humor.” And then it was my turn, and I said I thought
                    it was very useful to know how to fill a missing filling. Everybody was aghast
                    at this, and you could hear a penny drop. But of course what I meant in the
                    larger sense was that you have to be able to make do with whatever situation you
                    find yourself faced with; and whatever health problems arise or whatever
                    practical problems arise, you have to be a very practical sort of person to make
                    do in the Foreign Service. And one of the things that I had learned along the
                    way was how to fill a temporary tooth filling, and it had stood me in very good
                    stead in Indonesia when we only had one plane a week and several other members
                    of the Foreign Service and other diplomats lost their crowns and their fillings
                    and I was able to show them how to do a temporary tooth filling. And that's just
                    a sort of a foolish little example of how you really have to be prepared to face
                    almost anything in the Foreign Service. And that's why it is such a broadening
                    and exciting life, and I wouldn't have lived any other kind, given my
                    choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am curious enough to ask you where you learned how to
                        fill a filling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I lost a filling in the jungles of Burma, and I suffered very much until I
                    got home to my dentist, and he said, “This is perfectly unnecessary suffering.
                    For forty-nine cents you can go out and buy yourself some zinc oxide powder and
                    some oil of cloves, and you'll be all set, no matter where you are or what
                    happens to you.”</p>
                <p>So many things can happen to you in the Foreign Service of a funny little nature
                    that you have to be prepared for. I can remember giving a luncheon for John D.
                    Rockefeller in Indonesia, and to my horror I noticed that when he served himself
                    spinach souffle that there was a large red rubber band in the middle of the
                    souffle. I wondered to myself how I was going to handle this, so I immediately
                    engaged the woman on his other side in conversation which forced John D.
                    Rockefeller to turn to the woman on his right which permitted me a few seconds
                    in which I plucked the rubber band out of his souffle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very quick thinking, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: But that's the sort of thing that can happen because you never know what
                    the staffs are going to do abroad. Of course the famous story of the houseboy
                    that cooked up the tennis balls instead of dumplings in the soup and things like
                    that. So you just always have to be on your toes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During most of the time that you were in the Service, in
                        fact I should guess all of the time that you were in the Service, in the
                        first place there were naturally Foreign Service inspectors who came and
                        inspected embassies and individuals within the embassies. But as well there
                        was a kind of evaluation of wives separately from their husbands that went
                        into the husbands' efficiency report, as part of it. Do you remember when
                        that practice...that custom...began? Were you aware that it existed from the
                        beginning of your service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was my impression that it was always the case, that the wives received
                    some sort of mention and evaluation at the bottom of the husband's efficiency
                    report. Personally, I think it was a good idea because once they eliminated
                    that, wives became non-persons and they were no longer inspired to do much of
                    anything. Why should they, when their efforts would go completely unnoticed? So
                    I think it's a pity myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of comments were made, do you think, about
                        wives during that time? Were they more or less perfunctory in most cases, do
                        you think, or did they really have any bearing on the career of the officer
                        who presumably was the husband in most of the cases that we're talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: My husband has served on a number of selection boards and one comment he
                    never forgot and I never forgot it either. It was a single comment about a wife:
                    “She holds up her end all over town.” But seriously, I think that they were very
                    helpful comments about what the wife had to give in the way of languages or
                    representation abilities or whatever her particular interests might be. It
                    really is a great pity that they don't do that any more because high-ranking
                    officers want to know something about the wives of the people that they choose
                    for their staff. Often it's the turning point because you may have two or three
                    men who are equal in ability for the job but perhaps the wife might just tip the
                    scales. Nowadays it's all corridor gossip, and I don't think that that's any
                    improvement, frankly, over a proper evaluation in the reports. To me, that's a
                    great pity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were in the Service, did the
                        inspectors who did their inspecting of the posts where you were serving
                        refer at any time to the wives in the course of their visits to
                        embassies?</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, because in our day that was still very much part of it. I remember
                    that the only disagreeable report we ever got from an inspector, to our
                    knowledge, was in Sweden, when they came and they very much objected to the fact
                    that we had a luncheon party as first secretaries and we had five ambassadors
                    present at this luncheon party, not realizing that the luncheon party was in
                    honor of my parents and that these five ambassadors had been old friends of my
                    parents, that I had known since early childhood. I thought that was awfully
                    petty of the inspectors not to rejoice in the fact that we had so many good
                    friends instead of criticizing us for having friends above our station. And I
                    also think it's a pity when the inspectors are lower ranking than the people
                    they are inspecting, because I think that makes for rather annoyed feelings.
                    I've seen that happen in various posts, and I think that's a mistake.</p>

                <p>GREEN: But fascinating from the point of view of nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was speaking strictly about the activities that were
                        possible among the diplomatic corps there. I think you said that some of the
                        wives found it difficult in Australia because there was very little that
                        they had to occupy their time and that a number of them, perhaps then at an
                        ambassadorial rank, were highly qualified professionally and frustrated
                        because the regulations and laws of Australia did not permit them in any way
                        to exercise their professions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more
                        about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, it's not only Australia but any place within the Commonwealth.
                    It's impossible for a non-Commonwealth person to get a job and in Australia, and
                    I suppose in the other countries also, they really don't care much for volunteer
                    work because it puts the trade unions' noses out of joint. So that there really
                    is very, very little to do. I often envied our Chinese and Russian colleagues
                    because they always put their wives right to work in the embassy. I thought,
                    what a good idea! How much more I would have enjoyed my time there. We had a
                    magnificent house. The flora and fauna are absolutely unique. But if only I'd
                    had something constructive to do... I tried to work in the hospital but they did
                    not welcome me because, as I say, it does upset the trade unions to have any
                    volunteerism. So a busier post is always easier, I think. But we were blessed in
                    having an embassy plane, and we traveled very widely across the country and the
                    South Pacific islands, and that was a very enriching experience, and I thank
                    heaven that I had that wonderful opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course that makes me think again about your meeting
                        with Lord Mountbatten. Was that after or before you met the Duke of
                        Windsor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>GREEN: That was after, because that must have been in the mid-seventies that we
                    dined with Lord Mountbatten in Papua New Guinea under really lovely
                    circumstances—oleander blooming and the royal yacht sparkling with lights down
                    below in the harbor and so on. But we dined with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor
                    in 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You met the Duchess, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Marshall was sitting next to her and having as good a time as I was
                    sitting next to the Duke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course I was fascinated to hear about that encounter.
                        When you had your lengthy conversation with him about matters historical—and
                        I believe he was extremely well informed as historian at least of his own
                        family—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes, and delighted to find somebody else who shared his great
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He, I suppose, must have enjoyed the fact of the knowledge
                        that you had of his great- grandmother's letters, in such detail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh yes. I think I told you he sent me an autographed copy of his book the
                    next day, and they wanted to give a dinner for us which I would have loved to
                    have gone to, but we were transferred. In the meantime, Marshall was having a
                    very interesting time with the Duchess. I think the Duchess is so often
                    portrayed as somebody who cared about nothing except jewelry and clothes, but
                    Marshall elicited from her a very caring side of her, and that is that she cared
                    very deeply about the abandoned pet dogs of Paris because in France they make
                    much of their pets most of the year and then they go off to the country and for
                    some reason abandon these pampered pets on the streets of Paris. The Duchess
                    used to go around in her Rolls Royce or whatever, and collect these animals and
                    she had a regular shelter for these homeless animals, and she would not let the
                    owners get them back in the fall until they signed all kinds of documents
                    promising never to abandon their animals again. I think it's a pity that that
                    side of her isn't known because I have read any number of biographies and no one
                    has ever mentioned that. But she told Marshall at length about her work with
                    homeless animals in Paris, and I think it's a wonderful thing and I'd like to
                    enter it into the record.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your and Ambassador Green's careers certainly, as with so
                        many other people's, began to take shape at the end of World War II, but in
                        a very particular sort of way, your and Ambassador Green's life took shape
                        on the day of the outbreak of the war between Japan and the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that's very true. We were listening to the beautiful New York
                    Philharmonic on the day of December 7, 1941, and Marshall was giving me my
                    engagement ring against this lovely background of music, when the music was
                    absolutely rudely interrupted by this very excited voice saying, “Pearl Harbor's
                    been bombed.” And so we knew that this was the beginning of the end, and it was
                    wartime, not realizing that at the other side of the world my father in Tokyo
                    was actually receiving the declaration of war that very moment. It was Monday,
                    December the 8th over there, and he had come in the first thing in the morning
                    to check the cables before he went out for a day of golf. Monday there being
                    Sunday here, there were very few cables and very little to do. Of course they
                    had to work on Saturday to make up for it. So there he was looking at the cables
                    when in came Ambassador Ohno, the third-ranking official of the Japanese Foreign
                    Office, and by the way the first post-war Japanese ambassador to London. He came
                    in saying he had something of the gravest importance to impart, whereupon he
                    unrolled the imperial rescript and began to read the declaration of war to my
                    father. In the middle of that the phone rang, and it was Mrs. Grew, the
                    ambassador's wife, saying, “Drop everything and come here immediately. I need
                    you.” My father said very politely that he was doing something very important
                    and he would have to speak to her later. And the declaration of war kept on
                    being read aloud to him, and the phone rang yet again, and it was Mrs. Grew
                    saying, “Drop everything and come!” What had happened, was that one of her best
                    Japanese friends had come to visit her, and, unbeknownst to them, as the
                    declaration of war was being read aloud, all the gates of the embassy were being
                    locked, and the Japanese friend was being locked inside and couldn't get out
                    until my father came and facilitated matters. Anyway, as everybody knows, they
                    were then incarcerated right there in the embassy in the clothes they stood up
                    in for the next six months. My father and Chip Bohlen shared an office and they
                    slept on the desks or on the floor for the next six months. [Mrs. Grew and the
                    naval attach�'s wife and daughter, Mrs. Smith-Hutton and Cynthia, were
                    incarcerated at the embassy. All other dependents had been seat home
                    earlier.]The domestic staffs of most of the Americans were simply wonderful, and
                    at great risk to themselves, would come in the middle of the night to push
                    clothing and whatever food they could under the gates of the embassy, so at
                    least they had more clothing that way, but the food was insufficient. My father
                    lost 45 pounds, by the time he came back in August of '42. So that was how the
                    beginning of World War II affected both ourselves and my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had in addition to that dramatic personal experience,
                        at the beginning of the war, also the interesting comparison between
                        attitudes toward the end of World War II, that is, I mean the actual
                        physical end of World War II. In the course of your conversation with Lord
                        Mountbatten, to which you have referred and painted a picture of the
                        surroundings so vividly, there was a glint of the difference of opinion
                        between Lord Mountbatten and General MacArthur.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. The dinner took place on March 4, 1974, so that was a good deal
                    later, but I had the good opportunity of sitting next to Lord Mountbatten, and I
                    asked him the question that had burned in my mind for many years, and that is:
                    would the course of history have been different had the area commanders, such as
                    himself, been allowed to immediately re-enter the areas that the Japanese were
                    surrendering, rather than leaving it in a vacuum for the next two weeks until
                    after the signing of the surrender in Tokyo Harbor? Lord Mountbatten seemed very
                    happy to speak about this. His mind was very clear about what he referred to as
                    “the greatest muck up in history,” which is a wonderful English way of
                    describing these things. And he feels that, yes, things would have been
                    different had he been allowed to come in right away to Vietnam and Indonesia and
                    all those countries, but that in the long run the wave of history would have
                    carried along as it did, sooner or later the wars of independence would have
                    taken place, in particular in Vietnam and Indonesia, and that these things were
                    bound to happen.</p>
                <p>I do feel that I should mention how much I admired Lady Mountbatten's courage in
                    going into these places during this vacuum period where she had no protection
                    other than the fact of the knowledge that the Japanese emperor had in fact
                    surrendered on the 15th of August. As we all know, there were many Japanese
                    soldiers who refused to accept this who hid out in caves for thirty years and
                    more. But she went in armed only with the strength of her personality and
                    visited all the prisoner-of-war camps, particularly in Indonesia, Java and
                    Sumatra and so on. Particularly Java, I think, and brought hope to the
                    despairing prisoners, and I think she was a very remarkable woman. Some years
                    after the war, we found ourselves in North Borneo, which is now Sabah, at the
                    very house where she died, as it was the home of the colonial secretary. I asked
                    to be allowed to go upstairs and see her room, which I did, and in fact I
                    mentioned that to Lord Mountbatten—that I had paid a reverential visit to the
                    room where his wife had died, after being so courageous and done so many really
                    remarkable things during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She did indeed, and she continued to do those remarkable
                        things during the terrible Indian/Pakistan period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>These glimpses of your life have enlivened your memories I am sure, and in a
                    quite different sort of fashion that perhaps you would like to tell about. One
                    of them that comes immediately to mind, of course, is the visit of members of
                    the Kennedy family to Hong Kong in 1963 when you and Marshall Green were
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that was a very difficult visit because they were very independent
                    souls who did not wish to be tied down to any kind of a schedule, which made it
                    very hard to plan things, and logistically it made it very hard. We met them,
                    and the Governor had very kindly loaned us his own launch which we took across
                    the harbor. But at that time a very heavy fog rolled in, and we couldn't see our
                    hands before our faces; everything was silence and grey. And suddenly we found
                    ourselves practically up against a great grey hulk, and when Bobby Kennedy asked
                    what that was, and we explained it was an American destroyer in the harbor, he
                    simply said, “Board her.” So we pulled up against the gangplank, walked up the
                    gangway, and there was the officer of the day on duty at the top of the
                    gangplank, and he saw what he thought was his president rising from the fog, and
                    literally fainted dead away. But Bobby Kennedy was undeterred by this, and
                    marched right into the captain's cabin where the captain was having a shower! So
                    we had a rather awkward call.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of not sticking to a schedule is the fact that certain civilities
                    are due to the host government, and here was the Governor who had been so kind
                    and lent us his launch for the whole weekend. And yet the Kennedys never managed
                    to squeeze in a courtesy call, which made it very difficult for those of us who
                    had to stay on beyond their visit. But they certainly enjoyed the launch.</p>
                <p>Sunday was a beautiful day that weekend visit, and we were out in the middle of
                    Repulse Bay, when suddenly the Kennedys stripped off their clothes and were
                    revealed with bathing suits underneath, jumped in the water, and swam to shore
                    where the beautiful house that we had obtained for them was located. After all,
                    it was February which was winter, and in Hong Kong we all had our winter clothes
                    on, so Marshall and I had to hail a passing garbage scow and leapt into the
                    garbage scow with our arms full of the Kennedy clothing, since we were supposed
                    to be with them every single minute. The garbage scow took us to the cliffs, and
                    then we had to walk up sheer cliffs in my high heeled shoes and with my arms
                    filled with cameras and clothes. I remember thinking that my predecessor had
                    been twenty years older than I, and how would she have managed? It was all I
                    could do, being born and bred in Maine, to climb the cliffs for Bobby and Ethel.
                    But it does show that it is hard if you don't take the advice of the people at
                    the place, because there are things that are due to the host government, and it
                    just makes it harder for everybody if these niceties are not observed.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes, that's right. Some people just don't want to stick to schedules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I am reminded of is the single, I
                        think, episode of wives accompanying their husbands to the ambassadorial
                        regional conferences. And that took place during the Kennedy period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. That was in '63, and I think largely due to Katie Loucheim,
                    who was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, I believe, at the time.
                    She was the highest ranking woman in the State Department and she was a very
                    activist sort of person. A couple of months before our regular chiefs of mission
                    conference to be held in Baguio in March of 1963, she sent out messages to all
                    chiefs of mission wives that they were to be prepared with briefing books and be
                    prepared to give a discussion of conditions in their country. We were all going
                    to be paid for the first, and only time, to attend. So that was nice, and we all
                    enjoyed it very much. I don't know if it proved very much because we said more
                    or less the same things that our husbands said, with the additional problems of
                    housekeeping and staffing and should we have social secretaries, and things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about social secretaries, for example,
                        with your busy time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, most of us really felt that we had to have a social secretary, and we
                    did hope very much that the government would pay for it, which in many cases
                    they did. Not in all cases. But it was an interesting, worthwhile experiment. I
                    don't think it's been done since then. The only difficult thing about that
                    conference was that there were two chairmen, Chester Bowles and Averell
                    Harriman. And that was not an easy thing, to have two such dynamic people
                    running one conference. There were a good many heated discussions during the
                    course of the conference. It was interesting, though, and I wouldn't have missed
                    it for anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is security at a conference like that of particular
                        importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, very much so. And this is why we tried to hold the conferences in
                    Baguio, because in Baguio we had the Air Force base Camp John Hay, so we had
                    secure communications, as well as plenty of housing, recreation, and fresh cool
                    air, and so on. But that is of paramount importance. There have been times when
                    the Secretary of State or whoever, didn't have time to go to Baguio, and we
                    would meet in Tokyo or Hong Kong or Taipei, but those conferences were never
                    quite as satisfactory as the ones in Baguio where we had much more available to
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing we have not talked about in the course of this
                        interview is the question of security which is a matter since World War II
                        of considerable concern, and of course is becoming more so all the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I must say that I lean to the view that the other countries do, and
                    that is that we should have plainclothes, mature, professional, security people,
                    older people, people who have been in the business for a long time and know it.
                    I think that our Marine guards have always been very young and very
                    inexperienced, and also in many countries it's not desirable to have uniformed
                    people around. The host country doesn't like it. And then in times of unrest
                    there have been many occasions when the ambassadors had to order the Marine
                    guard not to be in uniform. But of course their haircuts always give them
                    away!</p>
                <p>The only brush that I personally had with the Marine guard was late one night in
                    Sweden. We were woken up by an irate phone call from Dag Hammarskjold, who said,
                    “I'm having the most terrible time trying to reach your ambassador because your
                    Marine guard has never heard of me, doesn't know who I am, and actually refuses
                    to put my call through to the ambassador.” So Marshall had to jump out of bed
                    and rush over and wake up the ambassador and tell him what had happened. But I
                    mean you can't expect these very young men to know who's who and what's what,
                    and I do think that we would be better served by having older people who are
                    professionals in the intelligence and security business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a number of unusually vivid experiences in Hong
                        Kong. Another that you might want to talk about is one that I think I'd like
                        to hear you describe yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: About the refugees? Yes, well while we were there, I think it must have
                    been the late spring of '62. Conditions in China were rapidly deteriorating
                    causing tens of thousands to pour across the border into Hong Kong, throwing
                    planks across the huge concertina wire barriers put up by the British. Only the
                    young and strong could make it. Well, Hong Kong couldn't handle these swarms of
                    people, and they fed them a meal and they gave them clothes, and after
                    twenty-four hours they pushed most of them physically back across the border,
                    although several hundred thousand managed to filter into Hong Kong and stay
                    there. It so happened that at that very moment Turner Catledge, who was the then
                    managing editor of the New York Times, was paying a visit to Hong Kong, and we
                    were all on a junk sailing around the harbor together when Marshall mentioned
                    the tragic plight of these tens of thousands of people. And the managing editor
                    of the New York Times said, “But why have I never heard of this?” And the New
                    York Times local correspondent, who was with us, said, “But I have written daily
                    dispatches yet the editors back home will never publish them.” So I think that
                    does show an example, and I have come across many such examples in our time in
                    the Far East, when the local correspondent wrote exciting and moving accounts of
                    what was going on that never saw the light of day at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose one might draw an analogy to some of the
                        episodes that you've described already in the course of this interview to
                        the people who wrote dispatches home to the State Department which were
                        either not read with knowledge and understanding or not accepted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, well that was the great tragedy of all of our China language officer
                    friends who really wrote the most thrilling dispatches, particularly Jack
                    Service, and his dispatches are now in a book called Lost Chance in China, but I
                    mean it was a lost opportunity just because the political climate at home at
                    that time did not allow the full expression of the facts that were going on in
                    the world. We can't just hide our eyes to the facts, whether we like them or
                    not, and that's where I think ideology always is a dangerous thing. It only
                    permits people to see what they want to see instead of what's actually going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about security, there are always instances in
                        which special events come into play. Perhaps you know of one or two
                        yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, one that comes to mind right now is Indonesia. You may remember that
                    in September of 1965 there was a tremendous upheaval and revolution in
                    Indonesia. Nobody knows exactly how many people were killed in the bloody
                    aftermath—perhaps 300,000. Anyway, people were being killed right and left and
                    it was a very dangerous period, and the dependents were evacuated, and Marshall
                    had to sleep in the embassy chancery for a whole month. When he came home, the
                    security and CIA and other people had decided to secure his/our bedroom and had
                    built virtually an iron cage inside the room—bars, you see, that followed the
                    walls, with two caged doors for our two exits, which they kindly painted with a
                    nice pale green, hoping we wouldn't feel quite so locked up and confined in
                    there.</p>
                <p>I got back in December, after the evacuation, and all the security men came along
                    to show me this new room, show me how the locks worked, and so on, and they were
                    really quite proud of their handiwork. And I looked around and I said, “I bet
                    you that I can break into this locked room in five minutes.” And they looked
                    absolutely horrified and crestfallen, and I explained that shortly before I had
                    left that we had been in our room when a wildcat had gotten into the attic and
                    had fallen right through the weak plaster of our ceiling and fallen right into
                    the room with us, which was a terrible situation. Fortunately we managed to
                    escape with skins whole. The security people were absolutely horrified to
                    realize that they had totally overlooked the weakness of the ceilings. All very
                    well to have an iron cage, but anyone could have gotten up into the attic and
                    walked along the catwalks and just jumped right through the ceilings. So that
                    you have to look at security from many different angles.</p>
                <p>But I remember later on, after we lived like that for about three or four years,
                    the security men came up from Manila and said, “How do you stand it?” And I
                    said, “It all depends on whom you are locked up with!”</p>
