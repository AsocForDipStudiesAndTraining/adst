                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This an interview with Ambassador Robert H. Miller on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy and today is May 23, 1990.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wonder if you could give me a little bit about your background—where did you
                    come from?</p>
                <p>MILLER: I was born in Port Angeles, Washington, in 1927. I had no connection with
                    the Foreign Service in my family background. I went to Stanford University in
                    1943 and graduated in 1949 after taking two years out for the Army. During the
                    immediate post-war period, like many young people, I was attracted to public
                    service in order to contribute to building a better world. In the second half of
                    my undergraduate career at Stanford, I got interested particularly in the State
                    Department and in the Foreign Service. I had some GI Bill left after graduating
                    from Stanford, so I got a Masters degree in International Affairs at Harvard.
                    From there I went into the State Department through a junior management intern
                    program. Harvard nominated me for the program after I had passed the requisite
                    Civil Service exam, and the State Department accepted me along with 20 or 25
                    graduating students from other universities and colleges for the 1951-52 intern
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: September 1951. I was “Wristonized” into the Foreign Service in 1956, and
                    have been there ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you first came into the State
                        Department as an intern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Junior Management intern program at that time consisted of a two-week
                    orientation program at FSI followed by three three-month assignments in
                    different offices of the Department. The State Department was committed to give
                    us permanent jobs after successful completion of the intern program.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My first assignment was in the Office of International Conferences at 1776
                    Pennsylvania Ave., NW. I thought it was interesting at the beginning, but
                    realized fairly quickly that it was a fairly routine job, engaged in routine
                    preparations of U.S. delegations for innumerable international conferences and
                    meetings. My second intern assignment was in the Office of European Regional
                    Affairs in the European Bureau, which was the office backstopping the U.S. NATO
                    delegation in Paris. It was an exciting office to work in at the time because
                    NATO was brand new and a central element of U.S. containment policy—this was the
                    beginning of 1952. When I got there as an intern the whole office was feverishly
                    working on preparations for the Lisbon Meeting of the NATO Foreign Ministers
                    which approved the first force levels for NATO. This was a very big and
                    important subject and the office was really humming. Larry Vass, my immediate
                    boss, offered me a permanent job and I left the intern program because of the
                    real career opportunity opening up to me in NATO affairs.</p>
                <p>I felt badly about bolting the intern program, but that experience taught me an
                    important lesson in life—and in career development: the institution can offer
                    you great opportunities, and being accepted into the intern program was one such
                    opportunity. But, for a young person with little or no experience and, as in my
                    case, to whom all jobs in the Department looked awesome and exciting at first,
                    the institution will not, indeed cannot, help one to discriminate among possible
                    job choices, which are likely to influence the course of an entire career.</p>
                <p>After three months in the Office of International Conferences, I knew enough to
                    realize I did not want to make a career of international conference
                    administration and that I was ready to move on. Then, after three months in
                    European Regional Affairs, which was dealing with central U.S. foreign policy
                    issues at the time, I was better able to distinguish between foreign policy
                    substance and foreign policy process. I knew I wanted the former and not the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>However, if I had gone on to finish the internship program with a third 3-month
                    assignment that still had not been identified as far as I recall, I had no
                    reason to expect the NATO job to be kept for me, nor did I have the vaguest
                    assurance that my third assignment would lead to a permanent job equal to the
                    NATO job. Had I left these decisions to the institution—the intern program
                    administrators—I could have ended up with a very different career path. And
                    given the major reduction-in-force instituted by John Foster Dulles a year
                    later, and what happened to many fellow interns from my class as a result, I
                    still feel my first major career choice in the State Department was a wise one
                    for me.</p>
                <p>I dwell on this at some length because it is relevant today to young people
                    trying to sort out career choices today.</p>
                <p>Anyway, European Regional Affairs was an exciting office to work in and I was
                    fortunate to be offered a permanent job and I stayed there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel at that time for the difference
                        between those who were in the Civil Service and the Foreign Service? How
                        were they melding them together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: As I recall, most of the professionals in the Office of European Regional
                    Affairs were in Civil Service. I therefore found myself surrounded at the
                    beginning of my career by Civil Servants, all of whom I thought were top notch.
                    I had a high regard for, and lived in awe of, the more senior people. The office
                    at the time was headed by Edwin M. Martin, who at the time was a Civil Servant
                    who had spent time in OSS in Washington and other wartime agencies. My immediate
                    boss was Larry Vass, also a Civil Servant. The others subordinate to Vass in
                    that office I am quite certain were all, or mostly, Civil Service. Many of them,
                    I suspect, had been hired either because of their technical background in
                    economics or their political-military background. Probably a lot of them had
                    been in military service— some of them had been in OSS, like Martin—and I think
                    a number of them had come into the State Department, which was growing by leaps
                    and bounds at the time through either military or civil service wartime
                    connections. There were occasional Foreign Service officers, a number of whom
                    also had been taken into the Foreign Service under the provisions of the War
                    Manpower Act.</p>
                <p>At the time, in the early 1950's, the State Department in Washington was staffed
                    largely by the Civil Service. Foreign Service officers rarely served in
                    Washington. As I recall, the legal requirement was that FSO's serve at least 3
                    out of 15 years in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of these people had been flooded into the Marshall
                        Plan too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Realizing that junior officers often are oblivious of the
                        problems of the more senior officers, did you get any feeling of the
                        problems the more senior officers faced during the McCarthy period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MILLER: McCarthyism had some impact. I came in toward the end of the Truman
                    administration, while Acheson was still Secretary of State. In January 1953
                    Eisenhower was inaugurated and John Foster Dulles came in as Secretary of State.
                    Aside from Dulles' call for “positive loyalty” from Department employees in his
                    initial address to them when he took office, the Bureaus of Security and
                    Consular Affairs were joined. This was an indication that the new Administration
                    was going to pay much more attention to weeding out undesirables in terms of
                    allowing immigrants into the country or giving temporary visas to people. It was
                    going to pay a lot more attention to security considerations. It was an
                    atmosphere that created a lot of apprehension, although I have to say that in
                    terms of individuals in the State Department—their own security clearance being
                    questioned—I wasn't aware of that. What was much more troublesome to me
                    personally as a junior officer, was the huge reduction-in-force I referred to
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Called a RIF.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Even though I was on one of the few permanent registers—if not the
                    only one—from which junior officers could get permanent tenure in the Civil
                    Service, I eventually got a RIF notice (even though I had been assured that
                    would not happen). Most junior officers in the Civil Service were much more
                    vulnerable than I because they could not get tenure. But the RIF was so
                    widespread, particularly among junior officers, that I eventually got a RIF
                    notice. I was lucky, my boss appealed the case, less because I was indispensable
                    but more because the person who was being bumped into my job, he felt, was even
                    less qualified than I was. I thus overcame the RIF and stayed in that office.
                    But it was the Reduction In Force that made us much more nervous as junior
                    officers than the security atmosphere. Had I finished the intern program and
                    landed a job in a less central office, I could very well have ended up in, say,
                    the Office of Educational Exchange in the Bureau of Cultural Affairs. A number
                    of my intern colleagues did end up there, and were later transferred with that
                    office to USIA. So, part of early career planning is wise decisions, part is
                    pure luck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was behind the Reduction In Force? What was the
                        politics of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Republicans came into office in 1953 for the first time in twenty
                    years. Their political argument was that the government bureaucracy had become
                    bloated under the “big spenders” of the Democratic Party and they were going to
                    try to trim it back to a Republican size. They also were convinced that the
                    non-partisan Civil Service and Foreign Service were actually loyal to the
                    Democrats.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I think, as a matter of fact, the Reduction In Force simply shifted people around
                    and created a lot of uncertainty and disruption more than streamlining the
                    government payroll. I don't know whether the government was actually trimmed
                    back or not. But certainly junior officers who had very little seniority were
                    much more vulnerable to be bumped out by people who had over the years risen up
                    to fairly junior professional grades and simply had more seniority due to the
                    length of time they had spent in government service. In any case, my
                    reduction-in-force experience, only a year and a half into my career, was highly
                    unsettling, demonstrating that a supposedly secure government job held in fact
                    many uncertainties. And this RIF was not the last of those uncertainties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then moved over to Paris still in NATO affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's right. I went on a Foreign Service Reserve appointment to the US
                    Delegation to NATO, which in those days was still in Paris, and was low man on
                    the totem pole—3rd Secretary— in the political section there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from 1954 to 1957.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. And it was while I was there in that Delegation that I was
                    “Wristonized”, the next career uncertainty I—and many colleagues—faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wristonized being the program...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Henry Wriston, a former president of Brown University, had been asked by
                    President Eisenhower to study the State Department—the first of a number of such
                    studies after the war— to ensure that its organization and personnel systems
                    were adequate to the immense challenges of the post-war world and the
                    unprecedented position of leadership in which the United States found itself.
                    Among other things, the Wriston Committee found that Foreign Service officers'
                    long service abroad caused them to lose touch with the country they represented,
                    while the civil servants in the Department were making policy analyses and
                    recommendations without having any contact with foreign governments and
                    societies. Wriston thus found that both services were working in their
                    respective vacuums. He therefore recommended their amalgamation into one Foreign
                    Service in which officers would be required to serve both at home and
                    abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>As you might imagine, the recommendation, which was accepted by the
                    Administration, caused great uncertainty and dislocation for both the Foreign
                    Service and the Civil Service—in my own case, the third time in the first five
                    years of my career. Foreign Service officers, who regarded themselves as members
                    of an elite service selected by a rigorous examination process, resented opening
                    the floodgates to the “hoi polloi” of the Civil Service. Many civil servants,
                    who by personal choice or family situation preferred working in Washington,
                    faced the major disruption of overseas service if they wanted to continue their
                    careers with the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues facing NATO at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, two big issues were hot in NATO while I was in Paris. One was how
                    West Germany was going to be integrated. When I arrived in Paris in the summer
                    of 1954, the French National Assembly had just turned down the European Defense
                    Community concept. That was the point at which John Foster Dulles threatened an
                    agonizing reappraisal of all of our policy. But very quickly the idea was
                    developed, and I don't recall whether it was a French idea, German or British
                    idea or our own, but it was one that we accepted very quickly, which was to
                    bring West Germany actually into NATO as a full member under certain safeguards:
                    that it would not have nuclear weapons, it would not have the so-called ABC
                    weapons—atomic, biological or chemical weapons, and that it would have a force
                    ceiling of twelve divisions or something like that. But that was the one big
                    issue— how to get West Germany integrated into the NATO structure. After the
                    fall of the EDC idea everybody rapidly coalesced around the idea of actually
                    bringing Germany in as a member of NATO.</p>
                <p>The other big issue, and that was the issue I was working on, was the NATO annual
                    review of defense programs. Every NATO member was questioned by its peers on why
                    it couldn't do more in terms of contributing forces to the NATO military
                    structure—the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE).</p>
                <p>It was the buildup of NATO forces and the integration of Germany into NATO that
                    were the two big issues of NATO at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again from your point of view, were there any countries
                        that seemed to be quite delinquent or very difficult to deal with from the
                        American delegation point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MILLER: France was always difficult to deal with. It was winding down its war in
                    Indochina and getting deeply involved in the Algerian conflict. So it had a lot
                    of problems which created issues within NATO, both with respect to its force
                    contribution and kind of strings it was insisting on with respect to force
                    contributions. For example, it was demanding that we provide it military and
                    economic assistance in Indochina as a price for its cooperation and force
                    buildup in NATO. It also was very prickly on the subject of the use of French
                    territory by foreign (US) forces. NATO Headquarters, both military and civilian,
                    were on French territory at the time. But also the logistics lines of
                    communications and oil pipelines were being built across French territory.
                    France was insisting on much more unilateral control over those multilateral
                    structures than most of the rest of us felt they should have in a multilateral
                    alliance. So, I think France was probably the most difficult.</p>
                <p>The others were the poorer countries in the southern tier like Portugal, Greece
                    and Turkey in terms of trying to get them to build up their forces. Basically
                    they were saying, we have the manpower but we don't have the money. If you give
                    us more aid we can build up more forces. And of course the conflicts between
                    Greece and Turkey were always a constant headache for NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we are talking now in the spring of 1990 where
                        there has been a dramatic change in the balance of our structure,
                        particularly in Europe, but how did you and those around you view the
                        “Soviet menace” at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In light of all the events in the late '40s after the end of the war—the
                    Berlin Airlift, the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Greek civil war and
                    Stalin's general attitude towards the West—I don't think there was much doubt in
                    anybody's mind that the Soviet Union was a threat. Because it had maintained its
                    forces in Eastern Europe the thought that it could attack West Germany and run
                    all the way to the North Sea with its forces was not an unreasonable appraisal
                    of Soviet capabilities at the time. In other words, if the West didn't rebuild
                    economically, industrially and militarily the powerful Soviet forces could
                    indeed put pressure on the West in ways which would cause them to collapse.
                    Also, in both France and Italy there were very strong communist parties which
                    threatened the internal political stability of two very important countries in
                    NATO. So the belief in the reality of the Soviet threat was very strong. I think
                    it was probably pretty widely held throughout all the NATO countries. Each NATO
                    country had its own political problems and it had to deal with them in its own
                    way. But as a generality I think the belief that Soviet forces were a threat to
                    the West was pretty widely held throughout the alliance, which made it possible
                    to build up these forces.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, I came back as a junior officer in the Executive Secretariat.</p>

                <p>MILLER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a very long period in a pressure cooker type of
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER:It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job and what was the Secretariat doing in
                        this period? This is the end of the Eisenhower period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That is right. I left the Secretariat in June 1960 so it was still the
                    Eisenhower period. I would describe the Executive Secretariat, and I would
                    suspect that it is still true today, as the bureaucracy's bureaucracy. It was
                    set up, in the early post-war era to support the Office of the Secretary and the
                    Under Secretary of State and the other Under Secretaries—the Seventh Floor
                    so-called. We made sure that staff studies going to the Secretary or his Deputy
                    for decision were properly staffed, had the proper clearances, were clearly
                    stated, etc. We also oversaw the preparation of briefing books for, as it turned
                    out, Presidential trips as well as for trips of the Secretary, or for meetings
                    in Washington of the Secretary or the President with foreign VIPs. So it was a
                    very high pressure and busy office.</p>
                <p>This was before the creation of the Operations Center. One of our “hazardous
                    duties” was to serve as the Departmental Duty Officer on a rotational basis. We
                    junior officers every 7 or 8 weeks drew the Departmental Duty on weekends and at
                    night. I can remember, for example, I was Department duty officer the day Dulles
                    died. It was on a Sunday and I went in expecting just to read the telegrams and
                    go home and be on call for the rest of the day. Shortly before 9 a.m. I got a
                    phone call from Martin Agronsky of CBS wanting me to confirm that Dulles was
                    dead. I had no idea of that and said I couldn't confirm. He got irritated and
                    hung up because he was going on the air in two minutes. Then about 5 minutes
                    later Under Secretary Douglas Dillon called me, he was number two in the
                    Department at the time. Herter had become Secretary of State and was in Geneva
                    at a Four Power conference on Berlin. Dillon confirmed to me that Dulles had
                    indeed died and that we had to make arrangements to get Herter back for the
                    funeral, etc. It was a very busy day. That was before the creation of the
                    Operation Center and we all very often acted like one-armed paper hangers on
                    these duty days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a training job it is probably the best one can think of
                        isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MILLER: A fantastic training job for a young officer. I went on some fascinating
                    trips because it was during the period when Eisenhower decided to travel. I went
                    on his trip to India and some ten other countries between here and India. I went
                    on one Eisenhower trip to Western Europe and I was at the famous U-2 summit
                    where Eisenhower and the Western leaders came but Khrushchev refused to meet
                    Eisenhower because Eisenhower would not apologize for sending U-2 spy planes
                    over the Soviet Union. So there was a lot of very interesting and high-powered
                    travel at the time. However, after three years I felt that I had had enough of
                    criticizing other people's staff papers coming up to the Secretary and I wanted
                    to make my own mistakes in a little corner of substance on my own. So I was
                    delighted to be selected as Belgium-Luxembourg Desk Officer right after the U-2
                    summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Eisenhower/Dulles/Herter
                        State Department? Did it seem to be running well—things moving up? Or were
                        there little dukedoms off to the side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I was pretty young and inexperienced at the time. I would say that
                    Dulles, as an individual was pretty formidable for a young officer to be around.
                    On the other hand, I don't recall ever hearing him raise his voice at anybody.
                    He was very cerebral, he looked formidable and he didn't have much small talk,
                    but as I say he was a decent person to work for as a junior officer. Basically
                    he was saying “do this” and “do that” and we were saluting and doing it without
                    much dialogue at our level. My impression of his relationships with his
                    Assistant Secretaries was that he used them. I don't recall having the
                    impression that the Secretary of State was cut off from the rest of the
                    Department or isolated by a small coterie of trusted assistants brought in from
                    outside, the way you hear the State Department is being run today—or the way it
                    tended to be run in the Kissinger period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the things that the Dulles Secretaryship
                        does seem to be—at least a well managed one. Ideas could move up and
                        down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that is my recollection. He had special assistants, both career and
                    political, who tapped into the Department very well. Of course, the Department
                    was a smaller, simpler organization, not nearly as complex as it is today. It
                    didn't have all of these functional bureaus like it does today—like the Bureau
                    of Narcotics or the Bureau of Terrorism or the Bureau of Refugees. It was much
                    easier to manage and coordinate than it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps another thing too was that everybody was coming
                        out of a wartime experience where you learned to work within an organization
                        and things flowed up and down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MILLER: Europe was still the center, other than possibly Japan. And, of course,
                    the fall of China to communism was a big issue, as was the Suez crisis in the
                    Middle East. But nevertheless the attention span of the Department and the
                    Secretary of State was not as dispersed as it is today. The colonial world was
                    becoming independent at that time, but the concept of a third world—even the
                    term “third world” hadn't been invented yet. We were dealing with colonial
                    issues essentially through the European metropoles either because they were
                    still running those countries or they had just put down their responsibilities
                    and we hadn't yet developed the habit or need to deal with all these countries
                    individually. A lot of them weren't even in the UN. So the world was an easier
                    place to deal with and the State Department was easier, therefore, to manage and
                    to run than it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get an impression in the Secretariat that there
                        was nothing more selective and arrogant than a young officer in a staff
                        position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It is true that young officers sometime succumbed to the temptation of
                    thinking not only were they working for the Secretary of State, but maybe they
                    were the Secretary of State. You had to guard against that because your
                    responsibility was to get the cooperation of the bureaus or the Assistant
                    Secretaries to make a better product to go to the Secretary. We were criticized.
                    We did irritate people just because of the pressure under which we worked.
                    Sometimes the people who were producing these policy studies felt that we were
                    nitpicking their staff studies to death while they needed to get important
                    matters decided by the Secretary. This was a matter of judgment: sometimes we
                    would get pulled back by our supervisors who would get irate calls from the
                    Assistant Secretary saying we have to get that paper through. Maybe all the i's
                    aren't dotted and t's aren't crossed, but it is more important to get the
                    decision than to make sure it is a perfect product. On the other hand we did
                    serve the function of ensuring that Assistant Secretary A wasn't trying to slip
                    something over on Assistant Secretary B by insisting that something go up
                    improperly cleared. So we did serve an important bureaucratic function. The fact
                    that the Secretariat survives until this day shows that it may be a headache for
                    the bureaucracy, but it may be a necessary headache.</p>

                        Did you have a feeling that there was a pecking order there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Off the top of my head I would say that during the Dulles era and
                    partly because of the shape of the world but also the press of events, the
                    European Bureau was at the top of the heap. Probably the Far Eastern Bureau, as
                    it was called then, was number two. Number three would be Near East and South
                    Asia, and number four was Latin America. That would be my impression. That was
                    the pecking order. The African Bureau didn't exist, it was covered, to the
                    extent that it was not covered by the European Bureau where the colonial powers
                    existed, by the Near Eastern and South Asian Bureau. I can't recall if the
                    African Bureau was created at the end of the Eisenhower Administration or the
                    beginning of the Kennedy Administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There had been an Assistant Secretary before Mennen Williams—Joseph
                    Satterthwaite, I believe.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, that is right. So the African bureau may have been created while
                    Herter was Secretary. I don't think it was created while Dulles was

                        the most exciting place in the world. But probably the one time it was
                        really on the forefront of everything was when you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I joined the desk two weeks after the Congo became independent and almost
                    immediately exploded into revolt and instability. However, I was delighted to
                    accept the job on the Belgian desk not knowing that it was going to be such a
                    busy and active place. In those days, young officers felt that a desk officer
                    job was the basic line job that you needed to have to advance your career. So I
                    was delighted to get a job in the Office of Western European Affairs which was,
                    let's say, the most prestigious office in the most prestigious bureau. Even
                    though Belgium and Luxembourg were not the most important offices...</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MILLER: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't going to get the French Desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's right. I was happy with it. Really most of the time I was on
                    that desk was Congo crisis. We dealt more with the Congo than we did with
                    Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the situation as you saw it at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Belgium had been pressed by the developing instability in the Congo to
                    give the country independence almost with no notice. In effect it announced to
                    the world and the Congolese that it was giving the Congo independence in six
                    months' time. Belgium, a small country, didn't feel it could withstand either
                    the pressures of the growing insurrection and instability in the Congo, or the
                    pressures from the United States and the United Nations to bring the Congo to
                    independence in a more stable and organized way. So basically, it just threw up
                    its hands and said, “all right, we give you independence”. Patrice Lumumba took
                    power as the radical nationalist, charismatic leader at the time. The Belgians
                    and the West generally were concerned that he would open the way for a Soviet
                    takeover of the Congo. This would have brought the Soviet Union into the heart
                    of Africa, which we were determined to prevent almost at all costs. I don't know
                    if we were prepared to send troops, but we immediately got the UN involved. The
                    process of trying to prevent the Soviet Union, in league with radical African
                    nationalist, newly independent, leaders, like Nkrumah in Ghana, made this a real
                    international crisis. And, of course, we were still in the depths of the cold
                    war. The U-2 summit, where Khrushchev refused to meet with Eisenhower, had taken
                    place in May 1960. The Congo became independent in June 1960. For the next two
                    or three years it was a major international crisis. We were trying to work
                    through the UN to prevent a major US-Soviet confrontation in the heart of
                    Africa. It turned out to be, I think, one of the more successful operations of
                    the United Nations because neither the Soviets nor ourselves wanted to confront
                    each other militarily in that part of the world. With our pressure on the
                    Belgians to pull out their troops and our efforts to keep the Congo from being
                    pulled apart. The Katanga, now called Shaba Province, where all the riches were,
                    threatened to become an independent nation and to deprive the central government
                    of all of the resources and tax revenues, etc. from the great mines of the
                    Katanga. In the end, the Congo miraculously was held together. The superpowers
                    did not confront each other there and under the UN an international force was
                    sent in and was able to bring about the creation of a fairly stable central
                    government.</p>
                <p>General Mobutu, who was then Colonel Mobutu, probably has outlived his usefulness
                    today, but at the time he was the great stabilizing force in the Congo and the
                    one around whom everyone was able to rally in order to prevent the Congo from
                    being radicalized.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are looking at this through the prism of our embassy
                        in Brussels. How was our embassy responding as this moved along?
                        Particularly in this period there was a tendency of our embassies to
                        identify...they had NATO on their minds and all this...with the ex-colonial
                        power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Our responsibility on the Belgian Desk in the European Bureau was to
                    maintain our relations with Belgium on an even keel and to look out for our NATO
                    interests. It was true, therefore, that our recommendations and our dealings
                    within the bureaucracy on this subject tended to reflect NATO concerns and the
                    concerns of our bilateral relations with Belgium. Therefore, we were in frequent
                    confrontation with the UN and African Bureaus. The Secretary and the President
                    had to decide where the ultimate US interests lay among these different
                    viewpoints.</p>
                <p>Looking back on it with some thirty years hindsight, I think the policy we
                    followed, even though at the time we felt it was bruising little Belgium and
                    might be jeopardizing some of our NATO interests, turned out to be the correct
                    policy: we put a lot of pressure on Belgium, since it had decided to give the
                    country independence and to relinquish its hold both militarily and to some
                    extent economically and certainly politically. At the same time, we put pressure
                    on the Soviets not to get involved. And thirdly, we sought to use the UN,
                    compromising some of our own national interests, to take hold in the area. I
                    think it was an example of a very successful peace-keeping operation which
                    preserved both Soviet and Western interests as well as bringing a very unstable,
                    sprawling country independence and giving it a relatively stable government. In
                    all respects, I think it was very successful at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate as a desk officer in this clash of
                        titans, you might say, between competing interests, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, you know the desk officer is pretty junior. I was attending a lot
                    of meetings, taking a lot of notes and accompanying people up to see the
                    Secretary—the Belgian Ambassador who was either being called in or who came in
                    with a complaint—I was basically a note taker and a cable writer. I did a lot of
                    writing of instructions. But basically what I did was to keep my bosses informed
                    so that if they felt that things were going the wrong way in terms of our
                    interests in Western Europe and NATO they could carry it to higher levels. So,
                    it was attending meetings; expressing views that I had cleared with my
                    supervisors; alerting my supervisors to problems arising that they might want to
                    take up and come to a more satisfactory compromise than I was able to do at my
                    level; being note taker in meetings of senior people, either Belgians or UN
                    people who were coming in to see high level people in the Department on the
                    subject of the Congo and particularly the Belgian aspects thereof. It was a very
                    busy time—but I was not a policy maker.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it is a wonderful position. You learn how things
                        work but you are not having to lay it on the line. What was your impression
                        of how our embassy in Belgium understood and served the cause of what we
                        were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think it did what it was supposed to do. Like the Belgian Desk in
                    Washington it was responsible to maintain good relations with the Belgians. The
                    first ambassador who was there when I was on the desk was William Burden, a
                    Republican political appointee, who was fearless in terms of promoting what he
                    felt was US-Belgian interests. He was a very strong personality. He was followed
                    by a very strong career personality— Douglas MacArthur II. Both of them, I
                    think, had a good understanding of overall US interests and therefore they were
                    not trying to prevent....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were not coopted, as sometimes happens, by seeing
                        things so much from the Belgian perspective that they lost...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I would certainly not say that. I would say that they were pointing out
                    possible consequences for US-Belgian relations or for NATO solidarity, because
                    NATO was also made up of other colonial powers who were concerned about Western
                    interests being overridden in the Congo. Sometimes they felt that the US was so
                    concerned about Soviet incursions into Central Africa that we were threatening
                    NATO solidarity. But, no, I think the two ambassadors to Belgium while I was on
                    the desk were balanced in their approach. They didn't always win their
                    arguments, but I do not think they were co-opted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about another major figure in this—I am trying to get
                        this from your perspective, of course—Mennen Williams who seemed to have
                        become absolutely enamored, if not tunnel vision on Africa as such and often
                        lost sight of our American interests. Did you have any feel of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Mennen Williams was Africa-oriented. There is no question about that.
                    That, of course, was his job. On the other hand, if my memory serves me, when
                    Mennen Williams became Assistant Secretary at the beginning of the Kennedy
                    Administration, there was a crisis, namely the assassination of Lumumba, which
                    forced the pace of the new Administration's decision process on the Congo. The
                    Soviets and the radical nationalist leaders of Africa were absolutely furious
                    and were sure that this was done as a Belgian-American or NATO plot. Therefore,
                    Adlai Stevenson at the UN was forced to take a much more radical anti-Belgian,
                    anti-Western position in order, in his judgment, to preserve the basis of UN
                    involvement and what he considered to be the basic US interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So, at the beginning of the Kennedy Administration, I think, this one event
                    forced our policy to move faster than let's say we Western European types felt
                    it should. We felt that that would jeopardize even more our relations with
                    Belgium, NATO solidarity, etc., etc. But I think, again with the benefit of
                    hindsight, that probably we were forced into that situation by events and not
                    just because of the tunnel vision of one G. Mennen Williams. He was kind of a
                    missionary on African matters, but my recollection is not that he was such a
                    missionary that he really caused US policy in the Congo to be distorted and to
                    undermine our basic interests in Western Europe and in NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again it might not have affected your perspective, but did
                        you have any feeling that there were some new, young, hot-shot characters
                        running around causing grief to policy makers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I did not personally have any sense of that. It is my recollection
                    that William Tyler was Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. He was pretty
                    staid. Harlan Cleveland was Assistant Secretary for International Organizations
                    Affairs and although a liberal thinker he was not wild and certainly wasn't a
                    young whiz kid. He was a man of mature years.</p>
                <p>No, I guess my feeling was that the fanatics in this whole thing were not so much
                    Mennen Williams, but career people on the Congo Desk like Sheldon Vance and Bob
                    Eisenberg. They were the real fanatics in the affair. Joe Sisco, who was then
                    the Office Director in UN Political Affairs, and Bill Cargo, his deputy, were
                    hard driving and very tough in the bureaucratic fights of the day and very
                    effective. Everyone concerned was under great pressure, but we in the European
                    bureau felt that Sisco and Cargo were fair and straightforward in fulfilling
                    their responsibilities. We didn't always feel that way about Vance and
                    Eisenberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything dealing with Luxembourg that caused
                        much of a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Not that I can think of. I had one nice trip to Belgium and Luxembourg
                    and that is the only time I have ever been in Luxembourg. We may have had a
                    visit from a member of the royal family, but I can't recall any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then go from one place where you are very much
                        involved to another place which certainly was gaining more and more
                        attention. You went to Saigon from 1962 to 1965. What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was the deputy chief of the political section. It was a huge political
                    section at that time—I think it had 16 or 17 people. I was newly promoted to the
                    old FSO-3, the First Secretary level, and was helping the political counselor
                    manage the work of the section.</p>

                        you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The guerrilla war, in terms of terrorist incidents, was heating up. This
                    was about a year and a half into the Kennedy Administration. By the time I got
                    there the US Military Advisory Group had been transformed into MACV, Military
                    Assistance Command, Vietnam, and the Advisory contingent had already grown to
                    about 10,000 US military personnel who were advising the Vietnamese armed
                    forces, sometimes under combat conditions, but were not participating in combat.
                    Fritz Nolting was still Ambassador there when I arrived. I had known Fritz as
                    well as Bill Trueheart, the DCM, at NATO in Paris, as I had Mel Manfull, the
                    political counselor.</p>
                <p>We were still trying to encourage Diem to broaden his political base in order to
                    compete politically with the Viet Cong internally in South Vietnam. We had
                    little, if any, success in encouraging Diem to do that. But that was the
                    situation. It was a growing guerrilla war. We were also puzzled as to how to
                    give growing support to the South Vietnamese government without breaching the
                    Geneva Accords even though we didn't like the Geneva Accords—at least John
                    Foster Dulles didn't like them when they were signed in 1954. We were still
                    trying to find ways to abide by their strict limitations in terms of our
                    military assistance and support. We were trying to get Diem to broaden the base
                    of his government. Nobody foresaw the problems that came up in the spring and
                    summer of 1963, namely the Buddhist revolt which ultimately burgeoned into a
                    situation which caused the Kennedy Administration to withdraw its support from
                    the Diem government—leading to his overthrow and assassination.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MILLER: Most of us felt that we were engaged in an important and constructive
                    effort—and that it was possible to achieve our objective, which was to preserve
                    the right of South Vietnam to determine its own future. And most of us believed
                    that the Diem government was worthy of our support even though it was to say the
                    least, flawed. Most of us believed that (Communist) North Vietnam was committing
                    aggression against South Vietnam and that this was part of Moscow's and
                    Beijing's effort to extend their domination, weaken the “free world” position
                    wherever the opportunity arose. South Vietnam was one such opportunity. When the
                    Buddhist revolt came in May of 1963 and began to grow into something that got
                    out of control, then there were a lot of different views within the mission.
                    There were those who felt we ought to go all the way with Diem. There were those
                    who underestimated what the Buddhist revolt was going to build into. There were
                    those who felt that Diem was not able to cope and the issue became one of should
                    we stay in South Vietnam and help somebody who was not able to help himself or
                    should we not continue our effort there. Of course, the decision was to brush
                    Diem aside and try to continue because the general judgment in Washington was
                    that the stake we had in preventing the communist takeover in South Vietnam was
                    great—almost greater for us than it was for the South Vietnamese. I think that
                    was the beginning of the controversial aspect of our effort in Vietnam. I mean
                    it was controversial in the press already and domestically it was somewhat
                    controversial, but I think that within the US Government it began to get
                    controversial after the decision was made to pull the rug out from under
                    Diem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were in the political section looking at
                        Southeast Asia. How did you see the threat to the United States of Diem
                        going and the North Vietnamese winning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think we were all taken with the domino theory argument—that all of
                    Southeast Asia, with the exception of Thailand, was newly independent and that a
                    number of Southeast Asian countries had already had their bout with communist
                    insurgencies—the Philippines, Malaysia and of course while we were there
                    Indonesia was having an increasing problem with internal communists—not
                    necessarily with insurgency, but nonetheless a threat of a growing communist
                    party. I think the way it looked to us as a government, and to most people in
                    the mission in Saigon—there were exceptions, there were critics—was that if
                    South Vietnam went, other countries of Southeast Asia could go as well.
                    Therefore, since no other country besides the United States could help South
                    Vietnam prevent this from happening, this was our job to do. This may seem in
                    1990 to be a mistaken way of looking at the situation, but I think that was the
                    way most people looked at it at the time—including most people in Congress, and
                    including many of those who became opponents of the effort.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, you know, nobody can rewrite history, but there was a coup attempt
                    in Indonesia in 1965 which failed by a hair. I think what is going on in
                    Cambodia today is a continuation of the historic pressure by Vietnam, communist
                    or non- communist, to dominate its weaker neighbors to its west, which in the
                    long term could put pressure on Thailand. If the great Soviet empire indeed
                    collapsed in 1990, I think we will have a different perspective on that problem
                    than we had in 1962 and '63 or even 1965 or '67 and '68. One of the things that
                    sort of boggles one's mind today is that, if you read the record, one of the
                    reasons the decision was taken in the Kennedy Administration to pull the rug out
                    from under Diem in addition to his apparent inability to deal with his Buddhist
                    crisis, was information that his brother Nhu was putting out feelers with Hanoi.
                    We were convinced that this was not in the US interest. That was an added factor
                    in the decision to pull the rug out from under Diem. How dare they negotiate a
                    compromise of some kind with Hanoi! Today that seems almost unbelievable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived at the embassy in the political section
                        you were obviously going out and collecting information, how well did you
                        find yourself in communication and being helped by our American military
                        there and the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We had in the embassy a small group of so-called provincial reporters who
                    were Vietnamese language officers—a group of 4 or 5 young officers—who were
                    traveling all over the provinces. They were greatly aided by all of the other
                    elements of the mission—the military, the CIA, AID, the USIS people—no question
                    about it. My impression is that we were greatly helped by the military and I
                    hope that the military felt we helped them in terms of giving them political
                    insights into what was going on. We sometimes had different perceptions. I think
                    we in the political section always felt the military over-assessed progress and
                    the military felt that we were always too pessimistic and undermining their
                    effort by suggesting that maybe progress was not as great as they thought. And
                    of course this was one of the terribly difficult things. We developed all these
                    statistical ways of measuring progress, like evaluation systems which were
                    program- directed. You know, the number of fence posts installed, number of
                    privies built or the number of hamlets put behind fences, etc. But none of those
                    statistics captured what really was going on, which was the ability of the VC to
                    come in at night and intimate the peasants behind the fences by lobbing a
                    grenade over the fence, etc. We never really, in our good old American way, were
                    able to capture what the real problems of the insurgency were: which were 1)
                    intimidation by the Viet Cong; 2) a lack of conviction on the part of the
                    non-communist Vietnamese that our side was going to win and 3) that basically
                    the US had replaced the French as, if not a colonial power, a sort of
                    neo-colonial power—something we never understood or wanted to believe.</p>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MILLER: The feeling in the political section was that the situation was getting
                    out of control. On the other hand, there was also a feeling that it was a
                    mistake to withdraw our support from Diem. There was some feeling that if we
                    felt that we couldn't achieve our policy objective with Diem maybe we should
                    liquidate our involvement there. But that from a political standpoint at home
                    didn't seem to be possible. I think that Kennedy probably felt that after the
                    Bay of Pigs fiasco he didn't also want the criticism that he had pulled out of
                    Vietnam which was under such communist threat. In other words, we were sort of
                    caught up in a no-win situation. But it seemed to us that Diem just didn't
                    understand how serious problems were internally in the country because he and
                    his brother acted in a repressive way rather than in a way to try and solve the
                    problems. We were kind of stuck with doing things their way or deciding to get
                    somebody else. And of course that was a disastrous decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as the political section worked—Diem-US relations,
                        I assume, was carried on by the US ambassador. Did you have much contact
                        with the rest of the Vietnamese government at various levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We worked under very great restrictions during the Diem era, because he
                    did not want us to see any opposition figures, he only wanted us to see those
                    who supported him. So we had a lot of contacts at the working level, at the
                    National Assembly and in the government. And we knew a few tame dissidents,
                    people who had spent some time in jail, etc. I suppose the CIA had contacts with
                    the latter as well. I can remember, for example, when there were National
                    Assembly elections in September of 1963, Diem promised Fritz Nolting that he was
                    going to broaden the base of the government and allow more people to run for the
                    Assembly. All the information we were picking up from our contacts showed that
                    it was going to be the same old National Assembly. I remember doing a wrap up
                    report on the preparations for the elections which basically said that there
                    wasn't going to be any more broadening, the same old candidates were appearing
                    and if opposition candidates were allowed to run they certainly wouldn't win. I
                    can remember that Fritz called me up to his office and went over that report
                    with me very carefully because it was so different from what he had been told by
                    Diem. I went over the material with him and he let the report go out, but he
                    kind of shook his head.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MILLER: He was a fine human being. He had no background in Southeast Asia—like a
                    lot of us. He, I think, was convinced that we had to back Diem. Those had been
                    his instructions. We would make a mistake if we didn't. He was very bitter about
                    his experience there and how he was replaced by Lodge. I guess my basic feeling
                    is, and I think in his book he says this too, he should never have gone on home
                    leave in the summer of '63. In other words, he felt this Buddhist revolt was a
                    flash in the pan and he could leave the embassy with Bill Trueheart in charge
                    and, of course, that ruined their personal relationship. I think that Fritz had
                    an impossible job and he probably wasn't flexible enough in seeing what was
                    really happening in South Vietnam. I suppose the Kennedy Administration decided
                    they wanted somebody with a high profile and political moxie and also a
                    Republican to sort of give a bipartisan sheen to the policy and the problem out
                    there and they sent in Henry Cabot Lodge. Anyway, I liked Fritz very much as a
                    human being, but I think he may have made some misjudgments.</p>

                        Trueheart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: When Fritz came back after home leave to say goodbye, he was there for a
                    matter of two or three weeks. He felt that our increasingly pessimistic
                    reporting in his absence had misled Washington to deciding to pull the rug out
                    from under Diem—that we had misled Washington about Diem's ability to govern the
                    country. I think Bill Trueheart was convinced, and most of us in the political
                    section were convinced, that Diem was so isolated from reality that he was not
                    really aware of how bad things were getting in terms of his ability to govern.
                    On the other hand, he was allowing his brother, Nhu, to use actions which were
                    increasingly alienating not just the rank and file of the population, but also
                    members of his own government. The sons and daughters of government bureaucrats
                    and military officers were being rounded up and beaten, etc. because these
                    protest demonstrations were spreading. But Fritz felt that somehow our reporting
                    should have been—the glass should have been half full rather than half empty. My
                    own feeling was that the embassy was reporting things as they saw it—that Diem
                    had lost control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting sort of into the internal workings of the embassy—
                        did you feel at the time Nolting left that you had been under a certain
                        amount of—the lid had been on and now we can report, or had the situation
                        changed so much that it was a natural evolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MILLER: When Lodge came, he was under instructions to determine whether or not we
                    could solve the situation with Diem and if not to encourage the generals around
                    Diem to understand that we were prepared to see a change. Because everybody then
                    understood we were contemplating a change, a lot of different assessments began
                    to appear. General Harkins, who was commanding MACV at the time, was reporting
                    that the war was being won, etc. The embassy was reporting growing unrest and
                    opposition to the Diem government and the body politic. That became the issue
                    for the Kennedy Administration. Which of these reports is correct? The thrust of
                    Lodge's instructions were if we have to do it we are prepared to dump Diem.
                    Therefore, there wasn't the lid on reporting the growing unrest of the political
                    situation. Nevertheless the decision to dump Diem was a very controversial
                    decision even within the political section. There were people who felt that if
                    you did this you didn't know what you were getting in for. There was nobody who
                    had the strength of leadership that Diem did. And even though he may not be
                    doing so well, we would make a great mistake to dump him. Where the truth lies
                    is still very difficult to say. Certainly after Diem went things
                    deteriorated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Harkins? One gets in reading
                        books and all that Harkins was way over his head in a very complicated
                        situation. From your feeling at the time, did he understand the type of
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: My feeling is that neither Harkins nor Westmoreland understood the kind
                    of problem that the US military faced in South Vietnam. My basic bias after all
                    these years is that one of the biggest mistakes we made was to take the war away
                    from the South Vietnamese. They became a subordinate command in their own war
                    and therefore we took away their stake in their own survival. The next question
                    is, “Was it possible to save South Vietnam in any case?”, and I don't know the
                    answer to that. On the other hand, I think in a sense everything we did, and I
                    think both Harkins and Westmoreland, and maybe all of us, contributed to
                    reducing the stake of the South Vietnamese in their own survival as a
                    non-communist entity. On the other hand, if you look at Southeast Asia today, we
                    achieved our larger objective—that of preventing the other dominoes from
                    falling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression when Lodge came? How did you and
                        the political section feel about the arrival of Lodge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was kind of exciting because he was a national personality. Lodge was
                    a highly political animal. I don't think that he was really interested in
                    objective analysis of the situation. He came convinced that we had to get rid of
                    Diem and I am not sure that he thought very much about the consequences. And, of
                    course, he didn't stay around long enough to live with the consequences. He went
                    back to run for President in 1964. He came back at a later time. As I say he was
                    a highly political animal, not analytical in the least, and not cerebral. I
                    suppose he was looking at these things always more in terms of Henry Cabot Lodge
                    and his role in history.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We would go up and brief him and very often end up listening to him more
                    than briefing him. I had a lot of contact with him, but I don't think I know how
                    to answer that question. I think that he had his mind made up by other sources
                    of information because he came out with two or three people who were his eyes
                    and ears and I am not sure he really listened to the political section very
                    much. He knew what he thought he had to do to carry out his instructions and
                    what was important to him was Henry Cabot Lodge. The reporting did go out. He
                    fired one DCM for thinking that he could run the mission except for those issues
                    he had to take to the ambassador. Lodge didn't like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: David Nes.</p>
                <p>But I think he had his own agenda. We didn't feel constrained by that
                    necessarily, but on the other hand neither did I feel that I or my colleagues
                    had great impact on his thinking.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MILLER: I was generally aware that there was a coup coming. I was given one
                    specific task to do which I guess made me aware of that. It had been determined
                    at some point that we should have contact with Diem's Vice President, Nguyen
                    Ngoc Tho, to express the hope that, if change was coming, it would be in
                    accordance with the constitution. I went over and delivered the message. He, I
                    think, got the message and responded very little. Of course, what happened was
                    that he was swept out when the generals took over. The day of the coup, October
                    31, I became aware of firing when I was home for lunch. I hopped into my little
                    Volkswagen and went down to the embassy and saw that there was concertina wire
                    spread around at various parts of the city. I had no trouble getting to the
                    embassy, but then it was confirmed that a coup was going on. Basically we were
                    just there to observe, take reports and do what reporting we could. We spent the
                    night there. I can remember being concerned about my family and trying to get
                    through on the phone. I got a constant busy signal all night because my wife had
                    talked to somebody during these proceedings and the phone had not gotten back on
                    the stand correctly. Anyway we watched the final stages of the coup and the
                    attack on the Palace from the roof of the embassy all night long. Once in a
                    while we heard a zing which would cause us all to duck down behind the parapet
                    of the roof. There was a great feeling the next morning of euphoria when it was
                    all over and some feeling of remorse when the news came through that Diem and
                    Nhu had been assassinated. I don't think that anybody, at least on our side,
                    intended that. I gather that Kennedy, himself, was rather shocked at that
                    news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems keeping up with who was in power? I
                        mean, the generals came in very quickly and the situation turned in to what
                        has been described as a revolving door. How were you operating in this very
                        difficult situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER:Once the coup took place and the generals came in, everyone was hopeful
                    that the problems that led to the coup, namely the growing unrest and
                    instability in the body politic, would finish and everybody would pull together
                    and get back to fighting the war. Of course that didn't happen. The generals
                    began squabbling among themselves. One of the generals who had been left out of
                    the coup group, General Khanh was pouting and he managed to overthrow the first
                    coup group. He was a disaster. Meanwhile the progress of the war began to
                    deteriorate with the VC gaining ever greater control over the countryside until
                    Thieu and Ky. By then we had long since sent in our own combat troops and had
                    taken over the war for good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until '65 so you were there during a great
                        deal of the revolving door. Did the reporting sort of move over to the
                        military side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MILLER: We constantly tried to encourage whoever was in power, usually a general,
                    to get some kind of constitutional base and some kind broadened political base.
                    There were two or three hopeful experiments in that direction, but they didn't
                    last. At this point I would have to delve into the record to be accurate as to
                    why they didn't last, but basically they didn't last I suppose because the South
                    Vietnamese had no experience in a democratic form of government and we kept
                    hoping they could somehow build on it under the pressure of the war. And of
                    course it turned out not to be possible. Then there were all these rivalries
                    among the military. One group would get tired of not being in power and felt it
                    could do better and would toss out those in power and then eventually they would
                    become the target of a third group. Until the thing sort of settled down first
                    with Ky, and then Thieu outmaneuvered Ky and Ky became vice president. Then it
                    settled down for a long time, but by then our own body politic began to get
                    impatient with the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about within the political section? What was your
                        attitude as you saw this thing happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think we all got very frustrated at the games the Vietnamese were
                    playing among themselves. Good, bright eyed, bushy-tailed Americans couldn't
                    understand why the Vietnamese would play all these games with each other instead
                    of fighting the war and achieving the common objective of keeping South Vietnam
                    free from a communist takeover. My considered judgment is that we provided the
                    South Vietnamese with the wherewithal to indulge in the luxury of these kinds of
                    games because basically they knew that if it was going to be won it was going to
                    be won by us. That in the end turned out not to be the case. We finally got
                    tired of it ourselves. But I think the atmosphere in the political section was
                    1) we were very busy trying to keep up with events, but 2) we all did get very
                    frustrated with the Vietnamese who kept blaming us for a lot of things and yet
                    were not able to get their own act together to run a government and to prosecute
                    a war in the way that we thought was in their interests to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of you sort of thinking “Well, okay if this
                        doesn't work what will happen”? Did you think the equation within Southeast
                        Asia was changing? Was the domino situation still upper most in your
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. At least, for me personally, until I got home and became director of
                    the Vietnam Desk in 1965. I think we were so absorbed by developments in Vietnam
                    that we probably didn't think a great deal about the impact elsewhere in
                    Southeast Asia, other than to be concerned that if Vietnam went the rest of
                    Southeast Asia would be in danger.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I think that my own doubts really didn't set in until I was caught up in the war
                    in Washington as head of the Vietnam Desk and saw the growing protests here. I
                    got caught up with the atmosphere here with LBJ trying to develop negotiating
                    positions and sending out feelers, etc. We tried bombing pauses to try to
                    encourage negotiations. I was doing a lot of public speaking, explaining our
                    Vietnam policy in the increasingly strident atmosphere in this country between
                    hawks and doves. I think that was where my own doubts about how this was all
                    going to come out and whether it was all worth it in terms of US interests and
                    costs began to building up. But while I was in Vietnam, no, we were frustrated
                    with the Vietnamese but I think we began to feel that Thieu and Ky were
                    beginning to get things back under control—at the beginning of their rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when General Maxwell Taylor came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression when he came out? It turned out to

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I didn't feel that Max Taylor, either, was the right man for that job.
                    Again, a lot of things were going on that the political section, or at least
                    this person who was the number two in the political section, wasn't privy to.
                    Taylor, if you read all the books since then, including the Pentagon Papers,
                    resisted the idea of US combat forces without consultations with the Vietnamese.
                    He got very frustrated with the internal political revolving door governments
                    and was very imperious with the Vietnamese generals. They resented that and at
                    one point tried to get him recalled. I suppose the role of any US ambassador at
                    that point would have been a very tough one. I think that Taylor had a military
                    rather than diplomatic approach in terms of getting the Vietnamese to do things
                    that we wanted to see them do. He tended to be too imperious, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1965 and came back to be what, the

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Vietnam Working Group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was essentially the Vietnam Desk. What were your
                        functions there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MILLER: I would say that the function of the Vietnam Working Group was to keep on
                    top of daily developments in Vietnam so that we could brief our superiors,
                    handle queries from the public, and make analyses of the internal political
                    situation in South Vietnam. In other words, we dealt with the mass of routine
                    problems in terms of our involvement in Vietnam without really getting involved
                    in the policy process.</p>
                <p>There was a lot going on in the policy process that we were not privy to. I can
                    cite one example. I was asked by my bosses one day to brief a congressman about
                    a certain peace initiative which I knew absolutely nothing about. That was
                    exactly why I was sent up to brief him—because I knew nothing about it. He could
                    tell within two minutes that I didn't know what I was talking about. He said,
                    “Mr. Miller, I thought that you were an expert on Vietnam, yet you obviously
                    don't know and can't give me the information that I need.” “Mr. Congressman,” I
                    said, “In the US government today there are many levels of expertise on
                    Vietnam.” He said, “Well, you go back and tell Secretary Rusk that I am leaving
                    for my constituency this afternoon and unless he tells me what is going on with
                    respect to this peace initiative, I will no longer be able to support him.” I
                    conveyed that message and it got to the Secretary very quickly. I understand he
                    did call the Congressman, and the Congressman stayed on the reservation. We were
                    constantly dealing with this kind of problem where we didn't really know what
                    the Administration was doing, either on the negotiating front or, to some
                    extent, on the internal front as well. So we were really managing the store and
                    doing the routine business and briefing governors, giving speeches—I went over
                    to brief the NATO Council on what was going on in Vietnam. Just doing the
                    routine business made for very long work weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously this is the period of time when the questioning
                        was getting greater and greater. I suppose in some ways for the first time
                        you were up against the real challenges of not just being involved but also
                        getting outside... How was this affecting you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was getting very tired. Physically and emotionally it was an exhausting
                    job. I guess that I was rapidly being convinced that we ought to find a way to
                    negotiate an end to it. I was relieved when LBJ [actually by then I had gone off
                    to the Imperial Defence College in London] found a formula for stopping the
                    bombing in the North and getting involved in negotiations with the North
                    Vietnamese. This led to the cessation of the bombing, and paved the way to
                    negotiating some kind of solution which, hopefully, would allow us to
                    withdraw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feeling of where was the driving force
                        between our continued military effort and going all out in Vietnam? Was this
                        coming from the White House, or Rusk? Were their different voices, some
                        saying let's negotiate and others saying....?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MILLER: I didn't have much contact even as director of the Vietnam Working Group
                    at the time with the top levels of the Department or the White House, but it is
                    my understanding from everything I have read and heard that basically LBJ was
                    determined to be victorious, and victorious in a way that would not endanger his
                    Great Society goals. Dean Rusk was pretty much with him on that and it was
                    McNamara who began to have serious doubt. There were plenty of people who had
                    doubts. George Ball, Dean Rusk's deputy, was always trying to argue the other
                    side and saying we ought to liquidate this commitment because we were in a
                    no-win situation. He felt our objectives were wrong. There were plenty of people
                    within the Administration and outside of Administration, and certainly growing
                    numbers on the Hill who were trying to persuade the US government to turn
                    around. I think it was the President, himself, who found it very difficult to
                    turn around. The final blow, the straw that broke the camel's back, was
                    Westmoreland's request in March 1967 for 125,000 more troops in addition to the
                    half million he already had in order to finish the job. The Pentagon said it
                    couldn't do that without going to full mobilization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems keeping your officers on the
                        Vietnam Working Group on the reservation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I don't recall that. Whatever their personal views were...no, I think
                    they were all disciplined people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really wasn't until a few years later after Cambodia

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That is right. That was more in the Nixon/Kissinger era than it was in
                    the Rusk/Johnson era. By then I was over at the Peace Talks where we all felt we
                    were at least trying to bring about a negotiation. But even there we began to be
                    convinced that we were just a front for Henry Kissinger. I would say that in the
                    '65-'67 period whatever our personal doubts were, my subordinates on the desk
                    did their job, what they were asked to do and provided their best judgment of
                    the situation in a professional way. We didn't have any revolts in the
                    ranks.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Actually we also had some Commonwealth countries represented. We had
                    Ghana, India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Jamaica, etc.</p>
                <p>Well, that was one of the things that the Commandant of the College was concerned
                    about. He asked me to take a low profile on Vietnam because he didn't want to
                    get us involved in constant debates about US policy in Vietnam, and I was happy
                    to take a low profile. But, nevertheless, the subject did come up and there was
                    a lot of criticism. But I don't remember that it was harassful. I felt that I
                    was at least able to explain our policy in a fairly civilized environment
                    without people getting rambunctious. Basically we tried to stay off the subject
                    of Vietnam and talk about a lot of other things that the British were more
                    interested in talking about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then assigned to the Paris Peace Talks from 1968
                        to '71. How did you get this assignment and how did you feel about it? I ask
                        this because in the Foreign Service one likes to move around a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Looking back on it, from the standpoint of a career pattern it may not
                    have been the best career move, but I was pleased with the assignment. Phil
                    Habib, who had been my boss for the latter part of my term on the desk,
                    replacing Len Unger, asked me to join the delegation. He was the senior career
                    State Department person, the Chief of Staff, of the Delegation. I was pleased.
                    My wife and I loved Paris. We had spent three years there in the NATO delegation
                    as junior officer and were delighted to go back. I thought that at least it was
                    a constructive effort on Vietnam at that point. I have said, and it is probably
                    true, that I stayed a year longer than I might have had the peace talks been
                    anywhere else.</p>
                <p>It did get frustrating, however. In the Nixon/Kissinger era which was basically
                    the time I was there, from the Delegation standpoint and certainly with the
                    benefit of hindsight, my view is re-enforced that our negotiating positions were
                    always too little and too late. Sometimes we would say on the Delegation that we
                    had thought of everything but Washington had rejected it. Nixon and Kissinger
                    had their own view about how to play this; how we should withdraw from Vietnam
                    without dishonoring the soldiers who had lost their lives there. They could
                    truly say that they were not responsible for getting us involved in that war.
                    But anyway, it quickly became apparent that we were not negotiating, we were
                    just going through the motions. The most interesting part was the times that we
                    met privately with the North Vietnamese, which we did do from time to time.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MILLER: When I joined the Peace Talks on November 1, 1968, the US and North
                    Vietnamese governments had announced agreement on a bombing halt and on wider
                    negotiations that would involve both the Viet Cong and the South Vietnamese
                    government. We were not anxious to have the Viet Cong and they were not anxious
                    to have the South Vietnamese government. This issue led to the 12 weeks that
                    were wasted on negotiating the shape of the table. There was an added factor, of
                    course, that prolonged this delay in getting down to the negotiations: Thieu was
                    determined if he could possibly do it to wait until Nixon became President. It
                    is said that he was hoping that Hubert Humphrey would lose and that Nixon would
                    win so that Nixon would be the one to negotiate. When Nixon did win, he was
                    anxious that real negotiations not begin with Harriman and Vance but that they
                    wait for Nixon's negotiators. So we had a hard time getting the South Vietnamese
                    to agree to anything we negotiated on the shape of the table. The issue, which a
                    lot of people didn't understand because people were fighting and dying in
                    Vietnam while the weeks went by, was whether or not we would recognize the Viet
                    Cong as an independent delegation, which we refused to do, and whether or not
                    Hanoi would recognize the Saigon delegation as independent which they refused to
                    do. So we tried to come up with all kinds of devices and I can remember everyone
                    drawing diagrams of tables. We finally came up with a round table with two
                    separate little tables at the diameter with the tacit agreement that each side
                    could describe the negotiation the way they wanted to, whether it was four sided
                    or two sided. We said it was two sided, and they said it was four sided. Anyway
                    this took 12 weeks before we were able to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was more delaying action in a way...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It wasn't a delaying action on our part. We were anxious to move ahead.
                    But there was a real issue, the real political issue of whether the Viet Cong
                    were independent, which we were convinced they were not, and whether the Saigon
                    government was independent, which Hanoi at least, was determined to show was not
                    the case. The South Vietnamese also employed delaying tactics because they did
                    not want Harriman to negotiate a peace settlement with Hanoi; they wanted to
                    wait until the Nixon Administration took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel that the North Vietnamese saw that
                        perhaps they would do better under the waning days of the Johnson
                        Administration than they would under Nixon, or were they willing to wait it
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MILLER: I am not sure about that. I really don't have any idea whether they
                    thought they would get a better deal out of the Johnson Administration than the
                    Nixon Administration. I think that their real view was, seeing what was going on
                    in the United States, that if they persevered the United States would finally
                    give them everything they wanted. The basic negotiating issue which kept
                    agreement from being reached for so long was that the North Vietnamese insisted
                    that the Thieu government be dismantled before they would withdraw their troops.
                    We insisted that there be a mutual withdrawal of troops before elections were
                    held to determine what kind of a government South Vietnam would have. Through
                    many permutations and hundreds of meetings that was the basic nut that could
                    never be cracked until, finally, at the end both sides did compromise and talk
                    about the shape of the government that would emerge in South Vietnam—sort of a
                    three tripartite government, as I recall, with elements of the South Vietnamese
                    government, non-communist oppositionists and National Liberation Front (Viet
                    Cong) people—before the troops were withdrawn. The whole negotiating position
                    that we maintained in my view made it easier for the North Vietnamese not to
                    agree and just hold out because we were gradually withdrawing our troops anyway
                    under pressure at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your leadership under the Johnson period was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: During the brief period that I was there before the Nixon Administration
                    came in, it was Harriman and Vance, with Habib again being the senior career
                    person. When Harriman and Vance left—actually Vance stayed on a month into the
                    Nixon Administration as continuity to get the new team started—it was Henry
                    Cabot Lodge and Judge Lawrence Walsh, the Iran Contra Special prosecutor. Lodge
                    stayed for about a year, as I recall. He and Walsh left and then there was an
                    interregnum with Phil Habib as head of the delegation for a while. Then David
                    Bruce was named and he stayed for a year or so. By that time, I left. Then Bill
                    Porter took over the delegation for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that the various heads doing this
                        made any great changes or were they under very tight instructions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Very tight instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about dealing with the North

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MILLER: We felt in the informal, private sessions which were away from the press,
                    etc., that we at least had a better understanding of their true positions. The
                    formal sessions at the Hotel Majestic where we would go out and brief the press
                    generally on what transpired were really just so much window dressing. The
                    informal sessions were more productive, but even so, they didn't really change
                    positions. They allowed us to explore more thoroughly whether there was any
                    negotiating flexibility in the other side's position, but that was really about
                    all. But we were really under such tight instructions from Washington that
                    regardless who was head of the delegation we didn't have any negotiating
                    flexibility...what negotiating flexibility we had was carefully controlled from
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had already had experience in the Vietnam Working
                        Group where you knew you were dealing with nuts and bolts and things like
                        this, but there were gods far above you who were handling these matters. Did
                        you feel that you were doing anything in these negotiations? Was it
                        difficult to keep up ones morale and stamina in doing this when you felt
                        they weren't for real?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, toward the end, the last year I was there which was by no means the
                    last year of negotiations, I felt it was time to move on and do something else
                    and that as a delegation we weren't really contributing to any real solutions;
                    we were just part of the Nixon/Kissinger negotiating process of 1) to maintain a
                    basic level of political support in the Congress for the continuing effort in
                    Vietnam and 2) as a cover for what Kissinger was really doing behind the scenes.
                    A lot of what Kissinger was doing behind the scenes we didn't know at the time,
                    at least I didn't know. It became discouraging although we continued to come up
                    with negotiating formuli, which we would discuss among ourselves and present to
                    Bruce, Habib and sometimes they would forward them to Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: They really didn't affect us very much. The subject may have come up in
                    our negotiations or in our meetings but I don't recall that it had a big impact
                    on us in Paris. We were kind of isolated from them because we were concentrating
                    on trying to find a solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any time when you could sit down in an informal
                        session with the North Vietnamese and begin to really talk about how this
                        thing could be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MILLER: You could get to know them a little bit as human beings, their families
                    and life in Hanoi under the bombing, etc., and talk about American baseball,
                    etc., but we were under such rigid instructions that if we had done our own
                    so-called “walk in the woods” like Paul Nitze did in Vienna with the Russians on
                    MBFR, we would have been jerked back immediately. If we had sent in a cable
                    saying we had this informal conversation and said, if we did this would you do
                    that, I think Kissinger would have had us drawn and quartered before sundown.
                    The North Vietnamese, themselves, were under very rigid instructions also. So
                    under the circumstances that kind of freewheeling exploration of negotiating
                    positions would not have produced anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any military situations occurring during this
                        period that had any effect on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I don't recall that there were. One of the things that we were always
                    concerned about, and Washington was concerned about, was a cease fire in place.
                    One of the reasons, we were not anxious until close to the end to have a
                    cease-fire in place was that South Vietnamese forces and remaining American
                    forces would be at a disadvantage because the Viet Cong were everywhere and a
                    cease-fire in place would have given them an advantage. We were concerned that
                    the military situation remain relatively favorable and not deteriorate so that
                    when it came time to stop firing, our side would not be at a tremendous
                    disadvantage. But other than that I don't recall that there was any military
                    action that we felt had a major impact, in a negative way, on the peace
                    talks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French play any role in what you were doing except
                        giving you food...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: For the most part they played the role of host and provided the site and
                    food during the breaks between sessions, etc. They played some role in the
                    background during the peace feeler time. Kissinger used Jean Sainteny as a
                    messenger at some point to explore possibilities in Hanoi and there were other
                    French people who played behind the scene roles. But once we were in the
                    negotiations, I am not aware that they played any real role.</p>

                <p>MILLER: I was a Foreign Service officer and did what I was asked to do. I guess I
                    could have said no, but Ted Eliot, who was the Executive Secretary, called me up
                    and ask if I would come to work for him, and I said fine.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The big change was that there was an Operations Center, manned 24 hours a
                    day which had taken over the Department duty officer function. The other aspect
                    that was different in 1971-73 to what it had been in 1957-60, besides the fact
                    that I was more senior and therefore more directly involved at the policy level,
                    was the constant struggle between the President's National Security Adviser, one
                    Henry Kissinger, and the Secretary of State, William Rogers, for control of the
                    State Department's business. We were constantly trying to instill discipline in
                    the Department and to discourage officers from going around the 7th floor and
                    influencing policy by telephone with an NSC staffer who in effect was being
                    directed by Kissinger to get input from the State Department without going
                    through the Secretary. That was a constant struggle of the Secretariat at the
                    time. Rogers was such a decent gentleman that, while he was sensitive to his
                    prerogatives as Secretary of State, he was not a gut fighter like Henry
                    Kissinger. So we tried to protect him, but I think we again were expending a lot
                    of energy and time in a losing battle.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I am not sure I felt that at the time, although everybody was constantly
                    aware that Kissinger was over in the White House trying to run with many balls.
                    Again, perhaps our noses were too close to the grindstone in trying to preserve
                    some position for the Secretary of State. We were a supporting organization and
                    had a general sense that it was a constant struggle to keep the Secretary of
                    State from being elbowed out of the way. We were never sure whether the
                    President wanted it that way or not, but we were, again, as good bureaucrats,
                    trying to protect the traditional role of the State Department. But it is quite
                    clear that Kissinger was the powerhouse and Rogers wasn't.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MILLER: There was the constant problem of the NSC-State Department rivalry. I
                    remember dealing quite a bit by phone with Al Haig at that point and thinking
                    that, as Kissinger's Deputy, he was the only sane person on the NSC. He was a
                    joy to deal with because, with all this Byzantine business going on, when you
                    got a call from Al Haig or you called him up, you knew he would give straight
                    directions or guidance, and if you asked him to do something he would get it for
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To translate this a little more, let's say you didn't call
                        Al Haig can you give an idea of what might happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Secretariat is the formal channel between the State Department and
                    the NSC. As the Executive Secretary and the Deputy Executive Secretary, while
                    there were channels below Haig and Kissinger, we dealt normally with Haig, or
                    there may have been a senior deputy, I don't recall. I just felt that he was a
                    good solid person to deal with because he was never flapped, he was always very
                    clear in what he wanted and needed—sometimes you would hear this guttural voice
                    in the background saying, “Gott damn it, Al, get off the phone, ve haff vork to
                    do!” He was just a good solid citizen. Whether that made him a good Secretary of
                    State or not is another question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is another matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: But Rogers was very much a gentleman. I guess the character most
                    difficult to deal with at that time was Butts Macomber when he was Under
                    Secretary for Management. He had a terrible temper and was generally just an
                    obnoxious person. I don't remember any other big personality problems. Graham
                    Martin was always sounding off and being very demanding as Graham Martin always
                    was. I remember once he refused to go back to his post until the White House
                    would give him an aircraft and they were getting to the point...</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I was Assistant Director for International Affairs for the Arms
                    Control and the Disarmament Agency. I went into a job that was traditionally at
                    that time held by a senior Foreign Service officer. I replaced Jim Leonard. My
                    principal job as it turned out was to chair the interagency backstopping
                    committee for MBFR which was just getting under way. I thought I was becoming an
                    expert in endless negotiations—from Vietnam to MBFR. I did spend a brief time at
                    ACDA, about a year. I was interested in the job but Phil Habib, who had been
                    named Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs, asked me if I wanted to be his
                    deputy for Southeast Asia. Despite having worked on Southeast Asia already too
                    long, I just felt it was too good to turn down. I liked Phil and had a lot of
                    respect for him and I found Fred Ekle who was the director of ACDA at the time,
                    a strange and frustrating guy to work for so I jumped at the chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ekle has had many jobs within the government. What was his
                        operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I had two problems with ACDA. One, it became clear to me that ACDA was
                    kind of a no-man's land between State and Defense, and in a sense a political
                    football between the Executive Branch and Legislature Branch. It was constantly
                    buffeted about by pressures either to do more arms control negotiating or by the
                    hawks to do less arms control negotiating. So I felt it was a rather powerless
                    agency—except when it was convenient for both State and Defense, including the
                    NSC, to use ACDA because State didn't want Defense to control play or Defense
                    didn't want State to control the play, and the NSC didn't want the bother of
                    referee between the two. So they chose the representative of the powerless
                    agency to chair the interagency backstopping committee. I found after a year
                    that that was kind of a bore, to be used simply because you represented an
                    agency that had no power.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I realized as it was happening that Ikl� and his senior staff were
                    brought in as a kind of housecleaning. There was a lot of criticism on the Hill
                    that ACDA was too full of “bleeding hearts” on arms control, so Ikl� was brought
                    in as a conservative who knew a lot about arms control and who would be tough.
                    They were looking around for somebody to replace Leonard. Secretary Rogers
                    recommended me to Ikl�. My problem with Fred was that while he was a brilliant
                    guy—very smart and very knowledgeable about these issues—I felt that he was
                    naive in the bureaucratic process. We would work like dogs to get a policy
                    decision on a certain issue through the NSC process and the next day he would
                    want to do something else. We would say, “Fred, we just got this issue decided;
                    we can't possibly afford now to undermine the decision even though it may not
                    have come out exactly the way we wanted it. We can't start off on this tangent.”
                    He was a true academic, I think. He loved dealing with ideas. Even if we had
                    gone through this terrible process he had a better idea the following morning
                    which he thought we should try. So when Phil called me up and offered me a job
                    as Deputy Assistant Secretary in EA, I jumped at the chance.</p>

                    including Indonesia.</p>

                <p>MILLER: No. Australia and New Zealand and even Papua New Guinea were outside of
                    Southeast Asia. They were dealt with by someone dealing with the South Pacific.
                    Actually in my day the economic deputy had responsibility for Australia and New
                    Zealand and the South Pacific.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I am very high on Phil. He is a unique combination of street fighter and
                    integrity. He could be as irritating as hell, very rough, but underneath he had
                    a heart as big as a watermelon. He was a great guy to work for. I really loved
                    working for him. When I got into that job, 99 � percent of it was the final
                    stages of Vietnam and Cambodia. In fact, I was absolutely stunned when I got
                    into the job about September of '74 to find that we were actually counting the
                    days of supply of ammunition for the non-communist forces in Cambodia, and
                    whether we would be able to provide ammunition with AID monies we had. And of
                    course the Congress was getting more and more restive about providing any money
                    at all. They stopped the AID money and the ammunition stopped as well. All of
                    this came to its end within 6 months in Cambodia and 7 months in Vietnam. Then
                    we began planning for the evacuation of the mission in Vietnam and were
                    concerned about the evacuation of the Vietnamese who had been associated with
                    our effort. So it was a very busy period. When we got through that stage, we got
                    involved with refugee programs and worrying about what was our policy in
                    Southeast Asia post- Vietnam. That was an interesting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the AID money stopped was it the general feeling that
                        for all practical purposes we had written Vietnam and Cambodia off?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MILLER: There was a sense in the Administration that it was not writing Vietnam
                    and Cambodia off; that if anybody was writing them off it was the Congress, the
                    Democratically controlled Congress. But the Congress got to the point where it
                    was determined not to provide any more aid even if the consequences were
                    dire—namely, even if the country went under. I think they had gotten to the
                    point where they thought it had done so much damage to our society that this was
                    the lesser of evils. But the Administration, to the very end, wanted to make
                    sure that if this happened it was clearly as a result of a Democratic Congress
                    and not as a result of the Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the reporting that was coming out
                        of Vietnam under Graham Martin? This has been a very controversial
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There is no doubt in my mind based on a visit I made to Saigon in October
                    1974 that Graham Martin ran the most tightly controlled embassy of any I have
                    ever had any association with. I attended, for example, a country meeting while
                    I was there. Nobody was allowed to speak at that meeting if it hadn't been
                    programmed with the Ambassador before hand. That is not the answer to your
                    question. But I am not sure I can answer the question the way you want, namely
                    that reporting was managed or distorted. Graham Martin's modus operandi, as far
                    as I could figure out, was that only he had access to the full range of
                    information. He made sure that only he had access to all that information. He
                    would not let information be generally broadcast. Therefore, only he had the
                    full picture and could make judgments about what was really going on. If Joe
                    Blow in the political section reported that this was the situation, Graham
                    Martin would say that that was not the situation at all because, “I happen to
                    know things that you don't know about it.” Did that distort the picture? It
                    probably did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were back getting these reports, did you have the
                        feeling that we were almost out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: As I recall our estimate in the spring of 1975 was that the situation had
                    deteriorated to the extent that the North Vietnamese were likely to capture I
                    Corps and most of II Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were to the north of Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's right. But that III Corps around Saigon and IV Corps could be
                    held. But that was on the assumption that we would continue to provide aid. In a
                    sense the reporting from Saigon was important as supporting or undermining those
                    assessments. As soon as it became clear that the Congress was not about to
                    provide any additional aid, all bets were off. Then we began really
                    concentrating on how to save our people.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with Graham Martin in trying to get
                        this evacuation going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Martin's legitimate concern was not to contribute to the collapse. He was
                    concerned that if we gave signs we were starting to evacuate our people it would
                    show the Vietnamese that we were convinced it was all over and they would,
                    therefore, stop fighting. He was also concerned that if we started evacuating
                    Americans our South Vietnamese allies could in effect turn on us and start
                    shooting down our evacuation planes out of bitterness that we were bugging out.
                    So he had a lot of legitimate concerns about the safety of Americans and about
                    trying to prevent having American actions contribute to the collapse in South
                    Vietnamese. It got to the point where he had to be ordered to prepare for
                    evacuation by providing us with the information we needed in order to organize
                    the logistic support to get people out. Washington had to sit pretty hard on him
                    to get him to do that. Then he had, I think, an idea that he might stay behind
                    and somehow negotiate through the transition. He was ordered not to do that but
                    to get out on at least the last plane. He was always a curmudgeon and he was
                    curmudgeonly until the very end. Then I think he was concerned that he was
                    somehow going to be made a scapegoat for who lost Vietnam. He wanted to have his
                    record clear so he could defend himself. But, to the credit of Nixon and
                    Kissinger, no one was looking for a scapegoat at that point unless they were
                    wanting to blame the Congress for contributing to the final collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out since we are putting this on the record
                        that evacuating Americans in any situation is always a very tricky thing. If
                        there is civil disorder and you say don't come in that can be a body blow or
                        an insult or what ever you want to call it—a political act, not a minor
                        little matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That is what I wanted to say—that Graham Martin had some legitimate and
                    difficult concerns that he was trying to deal with. One, the collapse of the
                    government that we had been supporting for so many years, two, the safety of
                    Americans. And how to manage all of this without some massive tragedy taking

                    he felt Habib was one of the few career officers that was worthy of Henry
                    Kissinger. He trusted Habib and felt that he was a disciplined career officer
                    who would carry out instructions with class.</p>

                        pulling out in the spring of 1975, before it actually happened what was the
                        prognosis of the future of Vietnam and Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MILLER: Our assessment, and this was an operational assessment, not a long term
                    assessment, was that probably the Mekong Delta which was the most populous part
                    of South Vietnam could be held indefinitely, provided we were willing to
                    continue aid. My recollection is that we were less concerned about Cambodia,
                    although Cambodia being next to Thailand, with which we have an ongoing security
                    commitment was of concern. But our principal concern was whether or not the
                    southern part of South Vietnam could be held.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it became apparent that it was really going to go,
                        what did we think? Did we think Vietnam was going to be a blood bath?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There was concern about that and therefore there was concern that we
                    provide a lot of shipping to allow Vietnamese who were trying to escape a blood
                    bath to get away and save themselves. So we did have a lot of ships positioned
                    off the coast. We were concerned about a blood bath. We were certainly concerned
                    that those who were associated with the joint US-South Vietnamese effort were
                    very much in danger if they stayed behind. And we know that many who did stay
                    behind or couldn't get out got put into re-education camps and were treated very
                    badly for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to do any coordinating beforehand about what
                        to do with refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, in addition to planning for evacuation, we began to plan how to
                    handle up to a million Vietnamese refugees and it very quickly became apparent
                    that this was a job too big for the East Asian Bureau because so many domestic
                    US agencies were involved in terms of setting up camps, etc. So very early in
                    the game an interagency task force was established as an adjunct to the
                    Operation Center which plugged into the White House and into domestic agencies
                    and also voluntary agencies who were called upon to provide clothing, shelter,
                    organize family sponsorships, etc. This effort was underway pretty quickly after
                    the collapse if it wasn't started before the collapse. Julia Taft was named as
                    the first permanent head of the task force. She was excellent—a real mover and
                    shaker. She had people like Bob Keeley who had come out of Cambodia, and Frank
                    Wisner, who had come out of Vietnam as her senior deputies and they were
                    plugging into all the agencies and we were getting appropriations to be devoted
                    to this. What the legal situation—getting them into the country—was I don't
                    recall. We set up camps around the country and proceeded to get voluntary
                    agencies to find sponsors for refugees. It became a very major effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, Cambodia was important, but secondary to Vietnam. It was kind of
                    Vietnam's flank. I visited Cambodia in 1974 while on a trip to Vietnam and
                    remember coming back feeling pretty good about South Vietnam but that Cambodia
                    was really on the ragged edge if it couldn't get ammunition from us. My
                    recollection is that we really focused much more on what would happen to Vietnam
                    than we did on Cambodia, because Vietnam was the prize really. Cambodia was
                    important but really secondary to Vietnam. It was clear that Cambodia was going
                    to collapse sooner than South Vietnamese would collapse. I think what we
                    overlooked with respect to South Vietnam was the psychological impact on the
                    South Vietnamese regime and people when they finally realized that the Congress
                    wasn't going to provide any more aid; the place then collapsed like a house of
                    cards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cambodia collapsed, South Vietnam collapsed, what did your
                        organization do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We continued to deal with the refugee problems although the basic action
                    responsibility had gone to the task force. We had a fairly immediate problem
                    with Thailand because we had about 40,000 troops there, mostly supporting our
                    military operations in Vietnam. The question was, would they stay or go? We had
                    an negotiation with the Thai where we ended up taking out all the troops except
                    for the military attach� and military assistance group. We would have preferred
                    to leave a small residue of people there, about 3,000, but we couldn't get
                    agreement with the Thai on that. The Thai were very sensitive, once we failed in
                    Vietnam, and did not want to irritate the North Vietnamese anymore than
                    necessary. It was a fairly quick negotiation.</p>
                <p>And then we began to try and think further ahead about what our policy should be
                    toward Southeast Asia in the aftermath of Vietnam. In the East Asian Bureau, we
                    were anxious that the U.S. government not make any rash decisions to “turn tail”
                    and ignore Southeast Asia. We spent some time on policy papers and thinking
                    about our relations with the new regional organization—the Association of
                    Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes the Philippines, Thailand,
                    Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and now Brunei. So a lot of our attention was
                    focused on how to preserve a constructive relationship with that remainder of
                    Southeast Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>There was another set of problems we were dealing with— residue problems
                    concerning Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. One, would we maintain an embassy in
                    Laos, and we finally did, at the Charg� level; two, we imposed trade and finance
                    embargoes on Vietnam and Cambodia; and three, we had to testify before the
                    Congress on a number of issues. There were many Congressmen who felt we had made
                    a mistake in imposing the embargoes. I testified on our rationale on imposing
                    these embargoes. Then there were people who were pressing us to provide
                    humanitarian aid to Vietnam and Cambodia. That was a policy decision that
                    Kissinger had to make. The issue was work-intensive because he wanted to look at
                    every request, every Band-Aid, etc. that humanitarian agencies wanted to send to
                    Vietnam. It was a busy post-Vietnam period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there did you see any possibility of
                        developing relations with the new Vietnamese government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: When the Carter Administration came in, which was shortly before I left,
                    they would have developed relations with Vietnam very quickly if it hadn't been
                    for Hanoi's gluttony in insisting on the alleged 3 � billion dollars in aid that
                    Nixon had “promised them” for signing the Paris Agreements. When Hanoi insisted
                    on getting its 3 � billion as a price of diplomatic relations, even the Carter
                    Administration, which was eager to overcome hatreds and tensions of the Vietnam
                    era, could not agree to that demand. I suppose you could say that Hanoi
                    outsmarted itself in that regard. So there was a point when relations could have
                    been quickly established with no conditions attached, but the Vietnamese
                    attached such impossible conditions that it just fell apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the role of China, the People's Republic
                        of China? The rationale for our being in Vietnam for a long time was that we
                        wanted to keep the communist Chinese out. As the Vietnam war wore down did
                        we see China becoming a non problem in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MILLER: In my view, we over-interpreted the Sino-Soviet bloc as a monolith and in
                    doing so we almost made the Sino-Soviet bloc a self-fulfilling prophecy. The
                    more I think about this question the more I am convinced, with the great benefit
                    of hindsight, that the first strategic error was made by the Truman
                    Administration in allowing General MacArthur to go to the Yalu in Korea. This
                    triggered a major Chinese military confrontation with US forces and made China
                    an adversary twenty years beyond what might have otherwise been the case. If you
                    read the record, after the fall of China in 1949 there was consideration given
                    to nearly reconciliation with China; there even was some consideration of this
                    after the Korean War during the Eisenhower/Dulles era. But the fact that the
                    Chinese had become military enemies of ours in the Korean War, I think, so
                    stewed our perception of this Sino-Soviet bloc that we didn't exploit the
                    tensions and potential tensions between Moscow and Beijing. Had we done so, we
                    might have been able to put the problem of Vietnam into a much more limited
                    perspective. We may have done the same kind of things and made a lot of the same
                    kind of mistakes. But if we had done it as a problem limited to Vietnam, rather
                    than making of Vietnam the front line between communism and the free world, we
                    might have avoided some of the mistakes that we made. It might not have become
                    such a vital interest to us that we felt it was at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's right. The rest of Southeast Asia is more prosperous and stable
                    than ever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you waiting for something to happen from China or had
                        you felt that Vietnam was such an entity in itself at that point that the

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: My recollection is that we took for granted the fact that the US was
                    never going to have relations with China. Rightly or wrongly, China was part of
                    the adversarial support for Vietnam just as the Soviet Union was and it was an
                    element that we had to deal with. Some consideration was given to invading North
                    Vietnam, but because of our experience in Korea everyone was concerned about
                    bringing the Chinese in. So we looked on China as an enemy supporting Vietnam
                    until Nixon came along and, quite rightly I think, tried to find a way to open a
                    dialogue with China. My point is that that had been done twenty years before if
                    we had restricted our objective in Korea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is, not going over the 38th parallel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Or at least sticking to limited military requirements in and around the
                    38th parallel. Maybe we could have reconciled with China a lot sooner. Maybe
                    Vietnam would have looked like a more limited problem had we done so. Q: Did you
                    have much to do with the Philippines?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I got involved in the Philippine base negotiations in 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It always seems to be a base negotiation or preparing for
                        a base negotiation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's right. Bill Sullivan, who was then Ambassador to the
                    Philippines, wanted me to come out and be thoroughly briefed on all these bases.
                    I was chairing the interagency committee working with Defense on our negotiating
                    instructions to him. He wanted to be sure I understood the importance of all
                    those bases. So I went out and spent about ten days touring around the
                    Philippines. But in the end, Marcos demanded more money than the generous
                    package that the Ford Presidency, with Kissinger as Secretary of State, was
                    prepared to give. Marcos gambled that he might get a better deal out of the
                    Carter Administration. It was too close to the end of the Ford Administration
                    for the negotiations to be consummated; they died out because we were not
                    willing to pay what Marcos asked for. He didn't get any more and in fact I think
                    he got less from the Carter Administration. But we did have a fairly major
                    negotiation.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, there was already a lot of criticism of the Marcos regime. For
                    example, Manglapus, who is the current Foreign Minister, was here as a dissident
                    at that point; he was stirring up criticism of our policy towards the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: September 19, 1990. This is the second interview with
                        Ambassador Robert H. Miller concerning his career. In our last tape we ended
                        up talking about when you were Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asia with
                        responsibilities for Southeast Asia. So now we are coming to the period of
                        1977-80 when you were ambassador to Malaysia. How did this appointment come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MILLER: I had been in the Department for six years and Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the East Asian Bureau for three years since 1974, and, of course, at that
                    time there was a change in administration. Jimmy Carter had been elected in
                    November 1976 and the new team under Cyrus Vance came in on January 20, 1977.
                    Dick Holbrooke was appointed Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific
                    Affairs. He had been a junior Foreign Service officer when I had been a First
                    Secretary in Saigon, and I think we both agreed that it was time for me to move
                    on as he came in to take over his duties. I didn't have anything against Dick
                    Holbrooke and I don't think he had anything against me. But I had been there for
                    3 years and he wanted his own team. As a career officer my hat was thrown into
                    the ambassadorial ring at that point and eventually out came Malaysia. This made
                    sense from my standpoint and the Department's because I had a lot of experience
                    in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Indochina problem by then, and had been
                    working for the past couple of years, since the fall of Saigon and Phnom Penh,
                    on the whole range of Southeast Asian problems. So the powers-that-be approved
                    my nomination as Ambassador to Malaysia. I was confirmed by the Senate and left
                    for my post in June of that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feeling that there were political
                        appointees who were trying to get this job? After all Malaysia would seem
                        like a nice appointment to give to somebody who is a non-professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I don't recall at the time feeling that political appointees were making
                    it difficult to get an appointment as an ambassador or even that it was
                    difficult to get Kuala Lumpur as an ambassadorship. My recollection is that
                    there were a lot of people contending the ambassadorships at the beginning of
                    the Carter Administration, including political appointees, and I sensed that I
                    was fortunate to get Kuala Lumpur with all the competition, career and
                    political. I do not recall that I was specifically contending against a
                    potential political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an attempt, I think, in the Carter
                        Administration to try to get professional appointments, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I assume that Carter was under the usual pressure as the victorious
                    presidential candidate to name political appointees. Most of his appointments in
                    Southeast Asia were career appointees with the exception of Dick Kneip in
                    Singapore. Kneip was a former governor of South Dakota who had been a political
                    crony of Jimmy Carter's or had gotten to know him during the presidential
                    campaign. He had no background in diplomacy and I think little instinct for it.
                    But other than that I would agree with you that the Carter Administration,
                    whether it was the influence of Cyrus Vance or not, appointed a good percentage
                    of good career people as ambassadors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went out did you have the feeling that the Carter
                        Administration and Holbrooke came in and wanted to change course towards
                        Southeast Asia, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Dick Holbrooke, himself as an old Vietnam hand and having participated in
                    the preparation of the Pentagon Papers under the aegis of Secretary of Defense
                    McNamara—was intent on reconciling with Vietnam and establishing diplomatic
                    relations and getting on to having a productive relationship with all of
                    Southeast Asia. This was the kind of the turning point that Dick had hoped to
                    accomplish during his stewardship of the East Asian Bureau.</p>
                <p>My own view is that two things intervened to thwart Dick in achieving those
                    goals. One was the drive in the White House to establish diplomatic relations
                    with China. Chinese- Vietnamese relations were tense, as they have often been
                    throughout history, and the White House gave priority to improving our relations
                    with China rather than with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The second thing that thwarted Dick in his desire to see a reconciliation with
                    Vietnam was Vietnam's mistake of demanding what they alleged was Nixon's
                    commitment to provide 3.5 billion dollars in aid as the price for establishing
                    diplomatic relations. Of course Nixon's commitment for the 3 billion plus in aid
                    was if the North Vietnamese would honor their signature on the peace agreements
                    as negotiated in Paris during the Nixon/Kissinger years. And, of course, they
                    hadn't done that. They had swept over South Vietnam and unified Vietnam by
                    force. It was politically impossible—not even Dick Holbrooke was in favor of
                    meeting that condition, and therefore any hope of reconciling with Vietnam went
                    a-glimmering during the Carter Administration and while Dick was Assistant
                    Secretary of East Asian Affairs. Later, of course, during the Carter
                    Administration Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia and that made it impossible
                    for any administration for some years to come to establish relations with
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Malaysia when you arrived there
                        in 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Our relations with Malaysia were traditionally very good. We had two
                    areas of contention within the context of overall relations. One was sort of a
                    traditional problem or difference of perspective between the number one consumer
                    nation for primary products and Malaysia, a number-one producer of primary
                    products. In this case tin, rubber and palm oil. Malaysia was very supportive of
                    the UNCTAD proposal at the time for a common fund into which consumers and
                    producers would provide funds to help stabilize world prices of eighteen or so
                    of these products, which were very vulnerable to price swings because of either
                    over- production or over-consumption. The US had a very different perspective,
                    feeling that the fund would never work—that it would be too cumbersome, although
                    we were in the process of negotiating through the UNCTAD mechanism. We had many
                    differences with Malaysia and other primary producers on the subject of the
                    common fund.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The other, more immediate crisis problem, was the great flow of Vietnamese boat
                    people across Malaysian beaches. It had already begun by the time I arrived in
                    the middle of 1977 and became a crisis problem for Malaysia over the next couple
                    of years. Malaysia, of course, felt that we were responsible for the flow as we
                    had failed in Vietnam and that also as a big wealthy country we had the
                    obligation to take these refugees almost before they landed on the beaches. That
                    was a constant irritant in our relations during my tenure in Malaysia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with that problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Essentially we dealt with it by working with the Malaysians, the UN High
                    Commissioner for Refugees' representative in Kuala Lumpur, and with other
                    resettlement countries like France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and others,
                    to solve Malaysia's problem. I felt that it was a considerable accomplishment on
                    the part of the US mission while I was ambassador there to increase the intake
                    of refugees for resettlement into the United States from something like 600 a
                    month to about 5500 a month. So we had a tremendous refugee operation in
                    Malaysia at the time headed by a young fellow, Joe Gettier who worked wonders,
                    both in terms of gearing up on the US side to take these refugees and working
                    out the various problems both with the UN machine and with the Malaysian
                    government. He really accomplished miracles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he working under you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was with AID, of course, but working under my authority and direction
                    basically to do what we could to relieve the pressure on the Malaysians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with Washington? I assume there was
                        always reluctance. They would much rather not have the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MILLER: The Washington perspective was different than the field perspective. The
                    Washington perspective was that Indochinese refugees had to be resettled within
                    US communities and therefore there was a big domestic political aspect that the
                    people in Washington had to deal with. There was a big bureaucratic, interagency
                    organization which plugged also into domestic departments and agencies of the
                    government and into the great private sector voluntary agencies in order to get
                    local communities to accept these refugees. From the field we were always
                    pressing for earlier decisions and decisions for bigger quotas. From the
                    Washington perspective, they were pressing us to increase international
                    cooperation—get more countries to take more so we could take less—and also
                    getting us to press the local UN authorities to improve conditions of the local
                    camps in order to reduce the incidence of disease, to improve the screening
                    process to make sure that we didn't take in what we would call any “ringers”
                    from the standpoint of our laws and regulations. We couldn't take ex-criminals,
                    drug dealers, and obviously we couldn't take people with communicable diseases.
                    We also had criteria as to what categories of refugees we could take. People
                    with relatives already in this country, people who had worked for the US
                    government in Vietnam, etc. So Washington had a different perspective putting a
                    lot of pressure on us and we had a field perspective putting a lot of pressure
                    on Washington. But together I think we accomplished a tremendous movement of
                    refugees during the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Malaysian authorities cooperative or were they
                        difficult to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Overall we got a lot of cooperation. There were crises. From the
                    Malaysian standpoint they have a very delicate ethnic balance in the country
                    which I used to call the fatal flaw of Malaysia. It was one of the most
                    successful former colonies among all the former colonies throughout the world.
                    It was one of the most prosperous, most politically stable, but they have an
                    “ethnic fault” line running the length and breadth of their country between the
                    Malay Muslims and the pork-eating Chinese. They looked upon this tremendous,
                    uncontrollable flow of refugees on their beaches as an uncontrollable influx of
                    people of Chinese culture—many Vietnamese refugees were of Chinese origin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vietnamese essentially come not from the Malay culture
                        but from southern China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MILLER: Not only that but all of these Chinese-culture people were coming across
                    the beaches in some of the most traditionally Muslim Malay areas of Malaysia,
                    thereby creating difficult and tense internal domestic political problems for
                    the moderate Malaysian government. Therefore the Malaysian government had
                    domestic pressures on them, including from radical Islamic elements which were
                    anxious to embarrass the moderate Malaysian Government, to get us, because it
                    was all our fault, to solve this problem immediately. When there were new
                    influxes of boats on the east coast—they seem to come in waves—that was when our
                    moments with the Malaysian government became the most tense. But both
                    governments realized that we had to work together to solve the problem. I think
                    they recognized from the statistics that we and the rest of the international
                    world were stepping up our intake of refugees. I think they realized that we
                    were cooperating and we were able to work out whatever transitory problems there
                    were.</p>
                <p>One of the big crises was when a big old cargo boat called the Hai Hong arrived,
                    for the first time on the west coast of Malaysia, about 20 miles from Kuala
                    Lumpur, with 2500 refugees aboard who were not starving, but were underfed, and
                    among whom disease was beginning to break out. It was an overcrowded, desperate
                    humanitarian situation. The Malaysian government's reaction was to tow the ship
                    out to sea and not let it land. It was the last straw for them. I was getting
                    urgent instructions from Washington not to allow that boat to be towed out to
                    sea. The US TV network cameramen were there to film this thing. I went to see
                    the Prime Minister, and we talked the thing out and he finally agreed—he was
                    being pressed, of course, by his experts to get the thing towed out to sea so
                    that they could ignore it. But finally, the Prime Minister agreed that, if we
                    and the other members of the international community and the UN High
                    Commissioner for Refugees would interview the refugees on the boat, in the
                    harbor and take them directly to the airport to go to their resettlement
                    country, so that the Malaysian government could assure its people that they were
                    not increasing the number of refugees in the country, they would not tow the
                    boat out to sea. We worked out that compromise and that crisis was solved.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MILLER: Frequently. We usually met under the auspices of the local UN High
                    Commissioner for Refugees, who was at that time an Indian gentleman, one, to
                    solve problems for providing adequate care for the refugees in the camps; two,
                    to present a common front the best we could with the Malaysian government; and
                    three, to work out the problems of quotas, categories of refugees, etc. The
                    Malaysians, as time went on, became concerned about what they called the
                    “residual refugees” whom nobody would take; they were afraid that they were
                    going to be stuck with them. There were certain hardened criminals, or people
                    who for one reason or another were totally unskilled and therefore fit no
                    resettlement country's criteria for acceptance. We would get together to discuss
                    those problems and see whether we could come to agreement that some country, one
                    country or another, would accept them to take them off Malaysia's hands. So we
                    did work very closely with the other resettlement countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Vietnam had an ambassador, and the Malaysians, had bilateral and also
                    ASEAN discussions with the Vietnamese, but at that time in the late '70s, the
                    Vietnamese were not very cooperative. The Malaysian and other ASEAN governments
                    had the feeling that the Vietnamese were trying to encourage the outflow of
                    refugees in order to destabilize the rest of Southeast Asia. I don't know
                    whether they were correct or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't any really working together...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, not at all. The Vietnamese, I believe, attended big international
                    conferences on refugees in Geneva and there was pressure put on them to
                    cooperate and slow down the outflow, etc. But in Malaysia proper where I was
                    working I don't recall any instance or evidence of Vietnamese cooperation with
                    the Malaysians or with the international community.</p>

                <p>MILLER: I would say very good. They had lots of problems of coordinating this
                    international effort—international staff coming from different bureaucratic
                    cultures and backgrounds trying to work together—but I would say that even
                    though we had our frustrations with them and they with us, that on the whole
                    their operation was very effective.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MILLER: Our basic interest was to try to encourage US investment in the country
                    and also in Malaysia as one member of a regional grouping—ASEAN. We had a
                    growing investment on the part of EXXON. They had an expanding oil drilling and
                    production operation on the east coast of Malaysia. While I was there oil
                    companies also brought into production a natural gas extraction operation in
                    east Malaysia off of Sarawak and Sabah. So there were big US oil investments
                    there along with other countries' oil companies. We had a fairly major and
                    growing semi-conductor investment in Malaysia. US companies, Texas Instruments
                    and a number of other companies, were installed there. They were competing with
                    the Japanese semi-conductor companies that were also getting installed
                    there.</p>
                <p>One of the problems for the American business community was Malaysia's new
                    economic policy. The policy had been instituted after the race riots of 1969
                    where hundreds of Malays and Chinese were killed. The Malaysian government had
                    decided on an economic policy designed to equalize the opportunities for Malays
                    to improve their economic conditions. The government set certain rules for
                    foreign companies as well as domestic companies which required that Malays by
                    1993 have up to 1/3 of the equity in these companies, that Malays be represented
                    on the board of directors, and that Malays be adequately represented on the
                    employment rolls. This gave some of the American businessmen some difficulties
                    in terms of finding qualified Malays, etc. In effect, it was a massive equal
                    opportunity program for the majority. On balance, I think the US businessman
                    found that he could operate in Malaysia, that Malaysia was receptive to foreign
                    investment. As I recall, our investment probably including the oil investment
                    was something over a million dollars while I was there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Texas Instruments moved much of its production there and
                        in a way we encourage this type of investment, but at the same time it means
                        a drain on American jobs. Is the ambassador getting directions from
                        Washington concerning this? How does this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That is an interesting subject, and a confusing one. The Carter
                    Administration, as I recall, changed the rules under which we were operating
                    with respect to American business. As I recall, we were not to encourage US
                    companies to try to sell arms. There was an attempt at least to leave the
                    armament companies more on their own. Similarly, we were to be neutral with
                    respect to the desire of American companies to find investments in Malaysia. Our
                    role was more or less restricted to making sure that American companies were
                    treated fairly and equally with Japanese companies, British companies, French
                    companies, in other words, with other international companies working in
                    Malaysia and that they were treated fairly by the Malaysian government if they
                    had any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble with businessmen at this time? Did
                        they complain about not getting enough help from the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MILLER: I don't recall any specific problem from an American businessman saying
                    that we were not giving him enough help. Let me make a couple of points. One, I
                    was very pleased that during my tenure in Malaysia the American business
                    community formed an American business council and they got the Malaysian
                    government's approval for the council. It was an American chamber of commerce,
                    but for some reason the Malaysians didn't want it known by that name. We also
                    succeeded in getting the then deputy prime minister, now prime minister,
                    Mahathir as the first formal speaker before that club. I think that was a very
                    good beginning for the council because basically Mahathir at that time laid down
                    the rules by which foreign businessmen were to operate in Malaysia. He said, “We
                    made the rules to solve our own internal problems, but we want foreign
                    investment and if you are willing to play by our rules you will find a very
                    receptive climate here.” And then he said, “If any of you find in dealing with
                    the Malaysian bureaucracy inconsistent with what I say here today, come and see
                    me.” And a couple of businessmen did come to me saying that they were have
                    problems and would like to get to see the deputy prime minister to see if they
                    could be worked out. He did receive them and I understood that their problems
                    were resolved. So, I would say we had a fairly good and constructive
                    relationship with those in government, including the deputy prime minister.</p>
                <p>I recall businessmen have individual problems, some of which, I think, were
                    self-inflicted, but I don't ever recall getting the complaint that there was
                    general unhappiness with the role of the US embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things we try to do in these oral histories is
                        to aim them at people who probably have not been involved in foreign affairs
                        themselves. Could you tell us what you would do during a day as an
                        ambassador in Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I would start out by reading the morning cable traffic...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be from the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, from the Department of State to find out if we had any new
                    instructions in terms of demarches to make on the Malaysian government, or
                    reports to send to Washington to answer their queries. I would read cables from
                    neighboring posts to see if there were any regional developments that affected
                    our business one way or another in Malaysia. I would certainly read cables from
                    other major capitals of the world that were sent our way to keep up to date on
                    major world developments. I would also read religiously the Wireless File, the
                    document sent out daily by USIA containing important public statements by the
                    President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, as well as articles
                    which would keep us up to date on major developments within the United States.
                    In other words, try to keep well informed about what was going on in the world,
                    in the United States, in the region where I was serving and elsewhere in the
                    world, to make sure that I was up to date on anything that might affect the
                    conduct of my responsibilities in Malaysia.</p>
                <p>The second thing I would do is have a staff meeting with at least the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission, the Political and Economic Counselors, the Defense Attach�,
                    the PAO and maybe one or two others to sort of plan our work day and to see
                    whether I needed to be brought up to date on any developments that they were
                    aware of but which I was not aware of.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, almost any work day would have a number of appointments. Either a
                    visiting American businessman; a foreign ambassador who wanted to call on me to
                    compare notes about something; or perhaps a visitor from Washington, either an
                    official visitor or an unofficial visitor who would want a briefing. There would
                    probably be either some luncheon commitment or a dinner commitment that would
                    require my attendance either for social reasons or for business reasons; to make
                    contacts under informal circumstances with colleagues, with Malaysian government
                    officials, with American businessmen, etc.</p>
                <p>Finally during the course of the afternoon, a lot of reports, primarily cables,
                    would end up on my desk for approval for transmittal to Washington to answer
                    Washington's requests for information, or initiated by us to make sure
                    Washington was aware of developments in Malaysia in case they got press queries
                    or congressional queries, or so we could on a continuing basis contribute to the
                    policy-making process in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The social side—the reception or cocktail is often the
                        bane of the foreign service life. How valuable were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MILLER: I would say that if you include cocktail parties, dinner parties and
                    other social invitations, I think they are very important for a number of
                    reasons. They are also a lot of hard work, not just social occasions. You never
                    know when you are going to find out something from somebody that is important to
                    you in carrying out your responsibilities. Very often you could find out things
                    on social occasions that people would be reluctant to tell you in a formal
                    setting in the office. In terms of social occasions generated by Malaysian
                    officials, there again you were showing them that you were interested in things
                    they considered important—ceremonies, ribbon cutting ceremonies or other
                    traditional ceremonies or occasions and therefore you were building up your
                    knowledge and understanding of the local culture, what they considered important
                    and hopefully making a favorable impression on them so that you would improve
                    your ability to deal with them and carry our your responsibilities. If you got
                    to know the ministers well or the secretaries general in the ministries, when
                    you had to go see them on business and sometimes make points on which they
                    disagreed, if you had a good personal relationship with them the conduct of
                    business was made that much easier. The process of developing a good working
                    relationship was enhanced by seeing them in informal social situations. So the
                    cocktail circuit is very hard work, but it does serve an important underlying
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I had a very good staff. It was my first ambassadorial assignment and I
                    was very pleased with my staff. I can't think of any professional staff member
                    who was a problem, whom I didn't feel was pulling his or her weight. It was a
                    very productive staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much dealing with people in the embassies of
                        neighboring countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. We had a relatively small diplomatic corps and a very close-knit
                    one. The Singapore ambassador was the Dean. He had been there many years. He is
                    now the president of Singapore. He was a highly respected colleague who did what
                    he could to get us together. But we also had our own professional reasons to see
                    our colleagues to exchange information and judgments, to coordinate positions,
                    etc. I don't recall any of the ambassadors or charg�s in Malaysia who were
                    difficult to get to know with the exceptions of the ones representing countries
                    we had no relations with, like the North Koreans and Libyans. But we saw a lot
                    of each other and often compared notes. It was particularly important to stay in
                    touch with the countries that were taking refugees in order to work out
                    problems, compare notes, exchange ideas, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This particular time from '77 to '80 what was the feeling
                        of those involved in matters with Vietnam? Was there the feeling that
                        Vietnam might become a major destabilizing power in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MILLER: During the first year and half or so that I was there, the intentions and
                    motivations of the Vietnamese were suspect because of the great refugee outflow
                    and the impact it was having on the entire region. There were efforts on the
                    part of the ASEAN governments in particular to try to persuade Vietnam to slow
                    down the outflow. Vietnam was not cooperative at all. Then, of course, when
                    Vietnam invaded Cambodia and occupied it at the end of 1978, there was great
                    consternation and I think indeed a genuine feeling on the part of the ASEAN
                    countries, particularly closest to Cambodia like Malaysia and Thailand, that
                    Vietnam may have aggressive designs on the region. And we were concerned about
                    that. Vietnam had just signed a security pact with the Soviet Union and nobody
                    was quite sure what Vietnam's ultimate intentions were. So there was great
                    concern in the region and I think a great concern on the part of many foreign
                    embassies there.</p>
                <p>We were still in the period of the aftermath of the fall of Vietnam and Cambodia
                    to communism and the failure of the US effort there. There was apprehension on a
                    lot of people's part that the US was “going to turn tail and run.” We tried to
                    assure them that that was not the case. We indicated our interest in
                    establishing a dialogue with the ASEAN countries whenever they were ready. We
                    pointed out that we continued to have security ties both with the Philippines
                    and Thailand and that we maintained these commitments.</p>
                <p>So there was concern about the security, stability of the region and about
                    Vietnam's intentions. There were a lot of common concerns throughout the
                    diplomatic community, particularly the Western diplomatic community and the
                    ASEAN diplomatic community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left Kuala Lumpur and went back to the
                        Department in 1980. How did that assignment come about and what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: When I was on home leave in 1979, Ben Read, then Under Secretary for
                    Management, asked me if I would be willing to work for him as Director for
                    Management Operations. My reaction was that I always go where I am needed. I
                    felt it was a little early to leave Malaysia and I said that I would prefer not
                    to come back until I had completed at least three years there. He was at that
                    time considering other candidates, but finally he chose me and pressed me to get
                    back in March 1980 which was earlier than I would have preferred.</p>
                <p>So I came back in March 1980 to be Director for Management Operations, my first
                    management job in the Department. I was there for three years during the
                    transition from the Carter Administration to the Reagan Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MILLER: Larry Eagleburger had set up the office when he was Under Secretary for
                    Management as a management tool to help him run herd on the three great empires
                    under his jurisdiction— Personnel, the Comptroller's Office and the
                    Administration Bureau. He wanted a small staff that had no operational
                    responsibilities to help sort out the priorities and recommendations coming up
                    from these three big empires in order to help him make independent judgments and
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>Within that general framework, the specific task of M/MO as it was called,
                    Management Operations, was to help the Under Secretary for Management allocate
                    the resources of the Department in support of foreign policy priorities. We also
                    had some additional specific tasks. We were assigned the unpopular task of
                    overseeing the so called MODE program, the interagency program designed to
                    monitor the limits on all agencies' employment overseas. A very unpopular
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this MODE program so unpopular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: As part of the annual budget process, OMB set agency-by-agency worldwide
                    ceilings on overseas employment in US diplomatic missions which the State
                    Department was then directed to enforce. Under that program, during the Carter
                    Administration, and I think it had also been enforced during the Nixon and Ford
                    Administrations, if an agency was up against its OMB overseas personnel ceiling
                    and wanted to put additional personnel, say, in Amman, Jordan it had to propose
                    to take somebody out of Bonn, Germany, let's say, in order to keep within its
                    worldwide ceiling. This became a cumbersome and basically unworkable procedure,
                    but the State Department liked to manage it because it was one way to keep
                    control over the mushrooming of other agencies within US embassies abroad.</p>
                <p>When the Reagan Administration came in, President Reagan sought to bolster our
                    defense expenditures and to build up our defense and intelligence capabilities
                    abroad. Secretary Weinberger immediately found that the State Department—my
                    office— was blocking his ability to send more people to Cairo, where we were
                    building up aid programs, because the Defense Department had no more overseas
                    personnel ceiling to do so. And therefore, in effect, he said to Haig, then
                    Secretary of State, “Your minions are preventing me from carrying out the
                    President's foreign policy.” Haig had enough problems of his own with Weinberger
                    and the White, House and so basically directed us to dismantle the operation. I
                    was put in charge of dismantling the operation. Many people in the State
                    Department thought that I was betraying the State Department because I was
                    dismantling the one mechanism whereby the State Department could control the
                    overseas presence of other agencies of government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the State Department's concern about other
                        agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>MILLER: The State Department looked upon itself as responsible for the conduct of
                    foreign affairs abroad. With the Secretary of State being the first cabinet
                    officer and the President's principal foreign affairs adviser, the State
                    Department looked on itself as the Secretary's agency for maintaining this
                    primacy in foreign affairs. Therefore we felt we properly had a role in
                    controlling the burgeoning of other agencies staffs abroad. My own personal view
                    is that this was a losing ball game. Not because the State Department didn't
                    have genuine responsibilities of managing and coordinating US foreign policy
                    abroad, but because US foreign policy as it was conducted abroad was becoming
                    more complex and more inter-related in terms of the responsibilities of many
                    agencies. Arbitrary ceilings on the positions available to other agencies was
                    not the way for us to maintain our primacy in foreign affairs. But the instinct
                    of the State Department was to keep other agencies down so that we could
                    maintain our primacy in the running of our missions abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a chance to look at the guts of the management
                        part of the State Department. One of the accusations that I have heard many
                        times is that those who are in the State Department really don't want to
                        manage. They are interested in policy formulation, etc. and often so
                        interested in the problems of policy that they lose sight of the fact that
                        unless you are a good manager you may not get what you want. How did you
                        feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I feel that the word “management” is over-worked. I think the word
                    “leadership” is a better one. The State Department is weak on providing
                    leadership—and I am talking now about the State Department as a bureaucracy and
                    not the relationships between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
                    Defense or the Director of CIA. State tends to substitute insistence on its
                    prerogatives and on institutional mechanisms such as MODE for genuine leadership
                    in the field of foreign affairs. For example, when we dismantled the MODE
                    operation and negotiated a new procedure to replace it, we put much more
                    responsibility on the chief of mission abroad to make decisions as to what he
                    needed as the President's representative to carry out his responsibilities in
                    the country to which he was accredited. It was my experience that very few
                    chiefs of mission were willing to exercise that authority and that instead, they
                    were constantly passing the buck back to the State Department to solve their
                    problems for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>In general, when State Department senior officers are asked to chair interagency
                    groups to review the policy toward country x or country y, they tend to rely on
                    mechanisms rather than on forceful leadership to solve their problems. I think
                    there is a weakness in the State Department on that score. In defense of the
                    State Department, the conduct of foreign affairs has become so complex across
                    the broad spectrum that it does in fact have to be coordinated out of the White
                    House. There is a State Department point of view and a State Department
                    responsibility, but the broad coordination of foreign policy really must come
                    out of the White House. Because almost every agency of government is involved in
                    some way or another in our relations with foreign countries as is our whole
                    society, whether it is a journalist or academic, scientist or travel group, you
                    name it, there is so much contact between countries today that the role of the
                    State Department, in my view, has shrunk relatively in the whole foreign policy
                    spectrum. Commerce and Treasury, for example, to say nothing of Defense, have
                    major foreign policy responsibilities. This is why foreign policy must be
                    coordinated in the White House. Nevertheless, the State Department, headed by
                    the President's first cabinet officer, the Secretary of State, could exercise
                    dynamic inter-agency leadership in foreign policy formulation and
                    implementation. In my view, it fails to exercise that leadership and, instead,
                    takes a parochial view of its prerogatives. As a result, from the White House's
                    viewpoint State is just one of the foreign affairs agencies that needs
                    coordinating.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two leaders, two Under Secretaries. First there
                        was Ben Read, who had been there for some time, and then Richard
                        Kennedy.</hi>

                <p>MILLER: And Jerry Van Gorkom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you do a little comparing and contrasting to how they
                        viewed their power within the State Department and their interest in what
                        was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Ben Read and Dick Kennedy and then Jerry Van Gorkom, who was brought in
                    from the business world, were three very different personalities. First of all,
                    Ben Read is a very gentle soul with a lot of experience in the State Department
                    and with his own views of how the resources of the Department should be managed.
                    Dick Kennedy was probably the most difficult supervisor I ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came out of the Army didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MILLER: He had been an Army officer. He had worked with Haig on the National
                    Security Staff and he is a man who, at least in that job according to my
                    experience, transmitted pressure on him to his staff rather than absorbing it.
                    He was just very difficult to work for. Jerry Van Gorkom came in as a personal
                    friend of George Shultz, but very quickly ran afoul of Kenneth Dam, who thought
                    he was the senior manager of the Department. Van Gorkom didn't stay very long.
                    He found that his frustrations were too great and he left very soon.</p>
                <p>The position of Under Secretary for Management is very difficult because there
                    are many pressures on the Under Secretary which make it virtually impossible for
                    the Department to operate in a rational fashion. Every time the Under Secretary
                    for Management or one of his senior assistants makes a decision it makes
                    somebody unhappy; great effort is therefore undertaken to overturn that decision
                    and very often the decision is in fact overturned. So, managing the Department
                    is a tough job. Sometimes a decision is overturned by the Congress, sometimes it
                    is overturned by the Secretary, sometimes it is overturned by the White House.
                    The rational use of resources in the conduct of foreign policy is still more an
                    art than a science. This is why I ended up believing that management operations
                    was an injury the Department could not afford, if one measured results against
                    resources. We conducted many studies during my stewardship of M/MO of how to
                    streamline, rationalize and conserve the use of resources. To my knowledge, none
                    of these studies were ever implemented: each recommendation gored someone's
                    bureaucratic ox and that effort was totally wasted. I recommended the
                    abolishment of the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Personnel matters become matters of much more concern in
                        the State Department than they do in many other organizations don't they
                        because of the constant change, the obvious prestige, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Personnel is a field where my immediate previous comments would have
                    applied in spades. The assignment process is one subject to very complex
                    procedures which are negotiated in great detail with the union, AFSA, and yet
                    are constantly being overridden by pressures above. Joe Blow gets assigned to
                    Asmara, which is not his idea of where he wants to be assigned; he sees somebody
                    up above him, who sees somebody up above him, who in effect goes to either the
                    Director General or the Under Secretary for Management and gets that assignment
                    overturned. So I think the personnel system of the Department is a major problem
                    area.</p>
                <p>I recall being very unpopular at a Bureau of Personnel “retreat,” by observing
                    that the more miles that were instituted to assure the rights of the employee
                    being assigned, the more dissatisfied with the system employees seemed to
                    become. At this same retreat, I couldn't help contrasting the rigid defense of
                    the Personnel Bureau's procedures and assignment system that occurred during the
                    formal discussions, with the utter cynicism about the system voiced by the same
                    officials informally in the lunch line.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Reagan Administration came in (a change from
                        Democratic philosophy to Republican philosophy) was their a hostile takeover
                        on the management side or was it done in good grace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I don't remember any sense of a hostile takeover. One of the big projects
                    we got involved in at the beginning of the Reagan Administration was the Grace
                    Commission. The President decided he wanted ideas from the private sector for
                    streamlining, rationalizing, reducing costs, etc. The Commission was headed by a
                    businessman W. R. Grace. It had teams that went into every agency of government
                    including the State Department. As Director of Management Operations, I was
                    asked by Dick Kennedy to be the Department's liaison with this team in the State
                    Department. We had a very good relationship. The people were very interested in
                    what we had to tell them, etc. and they had free rein in the Department. They
                    came up with a lot of recommendations, which to my knowledge, like a lot of
                    other recommendations have never been implemented. You cannot run the State
                    Department or probably any department of government like you run W.R. Grace and
                    Co., partly because it is not designed to meet a bottom line, it is designed to
                    perform services for the public. Also, it is always subject to a lot of
                    pressures both foreign and domestic which mean that it carries out its
                    responsibilities in a rather disorganized, inefficient, haphazard way sometimes.
                    But, no, I do not recall really having the sense of a hostile takeover. There
                    was some question at the beginning whether the senior career people in the
                    Department were going to be switched around, but that happens with every new
                    administration. Some were and some weren't. I was kept in that particular job
                    basically until I finished my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that some of the new political
                        appointees in the various geographical and functional bureaus were sort of
                        charging around and trying to put pressure on you to make sure that their
                        particular bailiwick got more resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, absolutely. We had fights for resources, for positions and for office
                    space. Those went with the territory. We had those constantly. I remember one
                    day being startled by a phone call from George Shultz when Dick Kennedy was out
                    of the country attending a conference. The Director for Management Operations
                    was always acting Under Secretary for Management under such circumstances.
                    Shultz had just been down inspecting the area that Elliott Abrams, then
                    Assistant Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs was occupying. Abrams had
                    complained to him that the management area was long delinquent in refurbishing
                    these offices. So the Secretary of State, himself, called me to complain that we
                    were not serving Elliott Abrams satisfactorily. I saluted and told the Secretary
                    that I would look into it immediately. As it turned out the rug-layers were on
                    their way down there almost before I did anything, I think in accordance with
                    their normal schedule. Anyway, yes, Assistant Secretaries sometime went to the
                    Secretary to put pressure on Management to get things done. That went with the
                    territory. In the Abrams case, I wrote the Secretary a little note saying that
                    we were taking care of these things and he sent me back a little note that very
                    graciously said, thank you very much for your expeditious action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then got another shot as ambassador. You were in the

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In the normal course of things. I spent three years as Director for
                    Management Operations and one day was called by Personnel and asked if I would
                    allow my name to be put on a list for the Ivory Coast. I said I had never been
                    to Africa and asked for time to check with my wife to see how she felt about it.
                    I came back and said sure. Somehow my name came out of the hopper and we went
                    off to the Ivory Coast as the representative of President Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Ivory Coast in this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Before I answer that let me say that it took me four or five months from
                    the time I was considered as a nominee for Kuala Lumpur before I was on my way.
                    The process had lengthened to ten months from the time Personnel first called me
                    up to the time that I actually arrived in the Ivory Coast. As I understand it,
                    it has gotten even longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the delay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MILLER: The delay is one in the nominating process. The pulling and hauling
                    between the State Department and the White House, the additional requirements in
                    ethics in government forms, for background investigations, for medical
                    examinations—the paper work is just very slow. As it happened my nomination
                    finally went up on the day that the Senate adjourned for more than 30 days,
                    therefore the nomination was sent back to the White House saying it had to be
                    resubmitted.</p>
                <p>The situation in the Ivory Coast was a fairly favorable one. The Ivory Coast,
                    like Malaysia, was one of the few success stories among former colonies. The
                    Ivory Coast, even today, is the world's greatest producer of cocoa and the third
                    or fourth greatest producer of coffee. And it also exports a number of other
                    things like tropical hard woods, etc. It was very prosperous and it had a long
                    record of prosperity. What it suffers from today was too great an assumption
                    that that prosperity would continue. It got very heavily in debt, prices of
                    cocoa and coffee dropped and I understand today it is in dire economic straits.
                    But basically while we were there it was a country under civilian leadership, a
                    civilian elected president, who had been elected five times, since the country
                    has been independent, and he is still the president. He is getting very old and
                    people are restive for a change, especially with the turn in the economic
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Felix Houphouet-Boigny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there did you go out with instructions
                        or ideas of what American interests were—what you were trying to
                        accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. The Ivory Coast was an easy country for the United States Ambassador
                    because it basically was supported by France as an ex-French colony and one of
                    many ex-French colonies in West and Central Africa. The United States looked to
                    France to support these countries with aid. Our interest under the Reagan
                    Administration and probably also under previous administrations, was to try to
                    promote US investment in the region. It had concern about subversion via Libya
                    and there were some incidents that occurred during that time which added
                    substance to our concerns, but we didn't pay a great deal of attention to the
                    Ivory Coast because it was: one, too prosperous for our aid; two, it was
                    basically supported by French and we were happy to have it that way. The French
                    ambassador was by far the most visible, highest profile ambassador in the
                    country. Most of the leadership, having been educated in France and having ties
                    with France were really oriented towards Paris rather than towards Washington. I
                    was fortunate when I got to the Ivory Coast that Houphouet-Boigny had just had a
                    State Visit in Washington with President Reagan and was still basking in the
                    glow of that experience. He had been the first black African leader invited by
                    the Reagan White House for a State Visit; it had been a very successful visit
                    even though relations were not that close and we didn't have a great deal of
                    day-to-day business. But in terms of diplomacy and symbolism I was able to enjoy
                    the fruits of that visit for most of my stay there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular things that we wanted to get out
                        of the Ivory Coast government at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We were very interested in their support in the UN and on our Southern
                    Africa negotiations. During the time that I was there the Ivory Coast was close
                    to the top of the Third World countries in the number of times it voted with us
                    in the UN or at least not against us. That was a very happy situation; even
                    though they sometimes took positions that we didn't like, they took a lot of
                    other positions in support of our objectives.</p>
                <p>We also wanted their support and understanding on our negotiations in Southern
                    Africa. Every so often I would get instructions to brief either the foreign
                    minister or the President himself on what Assistant Secretary Crocker was doing
                    in Southern Africa. Houphouet-Boigny is one of the grand old men of Africa and
                    is in touch with everybody. He even had quiet contacts with the South Africans
                    and was seeing people like Jonas Savimbi and Dos Santos in Angola. Therefore he
                    was somebody we were anxious to keep up to date on our negotiations in Southern
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>We wanted his support and understanding and, hopefully, his work with fellow
                    African leaders after the President decided to attack Libyan targets. Houphouet
                    was really very supportive of these US efforts. I use to argue that because
                    Houphouet was so supportive we ought to pay more attention to him; that he was
                    more useful to us and more important to us than our policy towards him would
                    suggest, but I never got very far.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there very much we could do for him? What could we
                        have done that we didn't do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think that we could have taken him more into our confidence than we
                    did. Even though we briefed him regularly, we really didn't confide in him or
                    consult him on moves we were about to make. I think we could have done more to
                    bolster the Ivory Coast economy. We could have done more to recognize the
                    support we were getting from him in the United Nations. They were conscious of
                    the fact that we didn't pay much attention to the Ivory Coast. So I think we
                    could have built a relationship that was more direct and closer in a number of
                    ways without saying that it should have been based on a lot of aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much to do with the French ambassador? Would
                        you use the French ambassador as an intermediary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the relationship between the French and ourselves in parts of the
                    world where the French have predominate interests is always a touchy one. We
                    were very friendly, the French ambassador and I, socially. We would exchange
                    information, but basically he wasn't very forth-coming. He never took the
                    initiative, as I recall, to brief me on developments that he was aware of. Some
                    of his staff were more helpful to our staff, but he was rather standoffish. The
                    French were always, in my experience, concerned if we were too active; had we
                    been more active in the Ivory Coast, they would have been convinced that we were
                    doing it to supplant them, to get them out of there. That was one thing that
                    Washington didn't want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In doing these interviews it seems a constant theme in
                        French Africa—the concern by the French that we are trying to supplant
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It is indeed a constant theme. It is a sensitivity on the part of the
                    French that is misplaced. On the other hand, if we had gotten closer to
                    Houphouet and he had spent more of his time worrying about what Washington
                    thought or was doing than what Paris was doing, this would have been seen as
                    inroads in their preserve. Even though they deny that the Ivory Coast and these
                    other countries in Africa were their preserve, in effect they were their “chasse
                    gardee.” And they wanted it to stay that way. It was hard to convince Washington
                    that we should be more active and it was hard to be active. The French had ways
                    of deflecting or thwarting us because they had advisers in the ministries, etc.
                    So it is an ongoing problem that hasn't been solved and, as long as France wants
                    to main its position in these countries, I think we will be happy because it
                    means their resources and not ours—and basically they are allies of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the events in Chad concerning Libya taking place at
                        that time? There we were playing a much more active role along with the
                        French.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, we were pressing the French, of course, to stay out in front. We
                    were providing them with transport for their forces, etc. and providing them
                    equipment. That was another area in which we kept Houphouet briefed and he was
                    pleased with what we and the French were doing in Chad. He was very much
                    concerned about Libyan intrusion into the center of Central and West Africa if
                    it had gone too far in Chad. So he was cooperative, sympathetic and supportive
                    vis-a-vis other African leaders on Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington did you feel there wasn't a lot of attention
                        as far as instructions from the Desk, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Bureau of African affairs, of course, has a problem. It has twice as
                    many countries to deal with as any other geographic bureau. Many of these are
                    small countries where we don't have many interests, but just bureaucratically it
                    is hard for one assistant secretary and his deputies to pay much attention to
                    any one country other than a crisis country. Even the Office of West African
                    Affairs, which was the office backstopping me in the Ivory Coast, had one office
                    director and 16 countries and a problem—the western Sahara. I always felt that
                    even the office director didn't have the time to pay enough attention to our
                    problems and what we were trying to encourage Washington to do with respect to
                    the Ivory Coast. Chet Crocker, of course, understandably, was almost totally
                    involved with Southern Africa. He spent most of his eight years working on that
                    problem and in the end he proved to have been able to accomplish something.
                    There were other crises like Chad, the Horn of Africa, etc. which kept the rest
                    of his attention. So a quiet, little, prosperous country where we assumed France
                    was going to take the leading role, was just a country we couldn't get much
                    attention to. And I guess I can understand that, but sometimes it was rather
                    frustrating to try to get answers out of Washington, and favorable answers to
                    things we were trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Abidjan in 1986. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came to a position at the National Defense
                        University.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. When my third year in Abidjan was marching along and I knew someone
                    was in the pipeline behind me, Dennis Kux, I started inquiring about my next
                    assignment. To make a long story short, I was sent as Vice President to the
                    National Defense University. It was a very interesting out-of-area, out-of-
                    Department assignment. It's a position that has traditionally been filled by a
                    senior Foreign Service officer who has served as an ambassador, because of the
                    long State-Defense relationship with the War College and the Industrial College.
                    When the University superstructure was created about 15 years ago, it was agreed
                    between State and Defense that the same structure would be followed, namely,
                    that the number two person, the vice president, would also come from the State
                    Department. I succeeded Bruce Laingen, who had been there for five years after
                    he came out of Tehran as our senior hostage. Basically it was a kind of senior
                    academic administrative position. I would advise the president, who is a 3-star
                    general and rotated among the services and in my time an Air Force 3-star
                    general. I would give him advice on the activities of the University and act as
                    his senior liaison person with the Director General in the Department.</p>
                <p>The big issues that were being dealt with while I was there were issues of joint
                    professional military education. Certain Congressmen had great interest in the
                    subject and were concerned that the educational programs at the National Defense
                    University were not sufficiently joint (inter-service) in their approach.
                    Therefore they were pressing the Pentagon to re-do the curriculum and re-do the
                    whole educational structure. While I was an “innocent bystander” in these
                    issues, I did have views and ideas on the subject as an independent observer
                    which I volunteered to the president from time to time, which I think he found
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In talking to my colleagues who went to the war college
                        one thing they commented on was that the military seemed to have a warped
                        view of the State Department as being an overly peaceful type of operation
                        and not being able to deal with things. Did you find that there was a real
                        divergence between the State Department people and the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, yes, I think there is a built-in bureaucratic and professional
                    difference of view between the military and the State Department officer. But
                    that is exactly the purpose of the college year to let each see the other up
                    close—to exchange views. And I think it is safe to say that by the end of that
                    year the Foreign Service officer has a better appreciation for the
                    responsibilities of the military officer and vice versa. Of course, a lot of
                    them develop contacts and friendships that are useful as their careers
                    continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is much more important now because in our time
                        you could almost rely on almost every male Foreign Service officer to have
                        served in the military, and that just isn't so today.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MILLER: On the other hand there is also, post Vietnam, an interesting instinct on
                    the part of the military not to resort to the use of military force unless the
                    issues, objectives and outcome are clear. You have more cases today than you may
                    have had some years ago where the Foreign Service officer is proposing the use
                    of force and the military is saying, “wait a minute, you don't realize the
                    consequences of what you are proposing.” And those kinds of exchanges are also
                    healthy and useful.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>The interview ended here. Following his assignment as Vice President of the
                    National Defense University (1986-89), Ambassador Miller spent two years as
                    Diplomat-in-Residence at George Washington University's Elliott School of
                    International Affairs. He retired on March 31, 1991.</p>
