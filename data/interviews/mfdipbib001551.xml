                <p>Recruitment into Voice of America and Initial Training: 1946</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the circumstances of your joining the Voice of
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: In 1946, the Department of State decided to start planning for
                    broadcasts to the Soviet Union, at first only in the Russian language. They
                    started not only planning the broadcasts as such, the technical aspect of it,
                    but the main point was to create a nucleus of competent personnel that they
                    could rely on, to start preparing that personnel for actual broadcasting. At
                    that time I was administrative secretary and executive officer of the French and
                    Belgian University-in- Exile in New York, which existed since 1942 under the
                    auspices of the New School for Social Research, whose director was Dr. Alvin
                    Johnson. They invited me in fact to be chief of administration for that
                    university-in-exile in January 1944. I stayed with them for three years.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Then in the middle of the summer in 1946, good friends told me that they had
                    heard that the State Department was looking for American citizens with native
                    knowledge of Russian, Russian-born. These friends knew that Russian was my
                    mother tongue. And since the financial basis of the French university-in- exile
                    was becoming a little shaky at that time, after the war, I decided to file my
                    application. By the end of September or so I was invited for a translation test
                    in the old Argonaut Building on 57th Street. The man who gave me the rest was
                    named Michael Benisovich. What he was, who he was, I don't know, but he was an
                    American citizen, a Russia intellectual of some sort, very nice gentleman who
                    had been delegated to carry out these tests. Apparently I passed the new
                    translation test on the spot. Two weeks later, I received a letter from Mucio
                    Delgado, who was the official in charge of recruitment, with a Russian text and
                    an English original, asking me to edit the translation that had been made by
                    somebody else. I edited that text at home and sent it back. The next thing I
                    heard was in early November, saying that I had been accepted. And so I informed
                    my wife and the university-in-exile and the New School, and submitted my
                    resignation. And then on December 30, on the basis of a letter from the State
                    Department, I presented myself at the Fisk Building. The letter advised me that
                    I was being hired as an editor, GS-12. When I came, and the young lady who was
                    sitting at the desk saw the letter, she flushed and said, “Wait a minute,
                    there's some misunderstanding,” and went into another room, came back and said,
                    “There is a mistake. You are being hired as a script writer, GS-11” — which was
                    a thousand dollars a year less” quite a cut, because the whole thing was $5,900
                    for the editor and $4,900 for a writer. I had already resigned from my previous
                    job, so I called my wife and said if it was all right with her I would still
                    like to accept. So we did.</p>
                <p>And then, the whole group that was assembled in these first few days — which
                    included Victor Franzusoff, who started the same day I did — the whole group was
                    extremely small, I don't remember the exact number but it must have been no more
                    than a dozen people, perhaps even less, for full-time jobs. Several were working
                    WAE or on purchase order, and most of them stayed on for a few years. Now, the
                    group of executives, or supervisors, who were in charge of forming that group —
                    transforming it, rather, from a motley crowd into a group of broadcasters — was
                    headed by Charles W. Thayer of the State Department; Nicholas Nabokov, who had
                    an indefinite status — I don't think he was full-time on the staff, I don't
                    recall that, he was in charge of programming and working out assignments and so
                    on; and then there was our good friend Eddie Raquello, to whom I think those who
                    started working then and worked for years owe an absolute debt of gratitude. He
                    may have been pedantic and extremely difficult to deal with but he gave us a
                    technical basis, a notion of what broadcasting means, including such amusing
                    points as when he was training his announcers, men and women, he said, “You
                    always have to speak with a smile on your lips, because then the listener will
                    feel that you are a friendly broadcaster. So whatever you have to say, say it
                    with a smile.” But on the other hand he was very strict and demanding, and he
                    thought of things, some of which I still use in the preparation of my scripts
                    today, as a free-lancer. We remained very good and close friends for the rest of
                    his life.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>We were given about seven weeks' time — the date of the first broadcast was
                    determined and announced from the beginning: February 17, 1947 — in other words,
                    all of January and two and a half weeks in February, to transform a group of the
                    old Russian intelligentsia into modern broadcasters. None of them had ever
                    broadcast; it was a superhuman task. Nevertheless, we achieved it. And here I
                    want to mention that we entered the service, Victor and I, on December 30, 1946
                    and on January 2, 1947, I was given the task of preparing a schedule of programs
                    in the field of science, technology and agriculture, as a project, and submit it
                    to Nabokov and Thayer. And when I looked at this page a few days ago I was
                    amazed. First of all because I am not a scientist, I am not a technician, I am
                    not a farmer, and I had been in this country at that point for seven years; I
                    had immigrated to the United States at the end of October 1939, after the start
                    of World War Two. Apparently I had gleaned enough information or impressions of
                    what America was all about that I was able to submit such a list.</p>
                <p>Frenkley Background</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: My background was very far from having anything to do with radio. I was
                    born in the south of Russia, in Odessa, and moved with the family of my divorced
                    mother to Bessarabia, to Kishinev, where her parents and she lived at that time.
                    I was born in 1907 and we moved to Kishinev in 1911. My grandfather was an
                    industrialist. My mother on the other hand wanted to become a lawyer, and she
                    had been permitted by her parents to go to Paris — she was 18 — and she entered
                    the law school of the University of Paris. My father was ten years older and was
                    a writer and a musicologist and a violinist. Also a socialist, not very well
                    regarded by the Imperial government, he was also studying in Paris. And they met
                    and fell in love and decided to get married. They came back to Odessa, and were
                    married. A year later I was born. Two or three years later they were divorced,
                    because both were very strong personalities, each wanting his or her own way;
                    there was no compatibility.</p>
                <p>I went through high school, which was still Russian in the beginning, the first
                    several years. In the winter of 1918, Romania took over Bessarabia, after which
                    the gradual Romanization of the educational and administrative system of the
                    whole province started and moved very fast. The result was that I started with
                    the Imperial gymnasium and ended with a diploma of a Romanian lycee, which was
                    the equivalent to the French lycee, which opened the doors to most Western
                    European universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In the fall of 1925 I moved to Paris and entered law school, and in three years
                    obtained my licentiate degree in law — in between the master's and the
                    doctorate, in French terminology — and continued my study of English for several
                    years. After that, being a graduate of the law school, I had the special
                    possibility of doing in one year what normally takes more, at the Academy of
                    Higher Commercial Studies in Paris. Then I came back and spent a reduced term in
                    military service in Romania, as a university graduate. I obtained the
                    equivalence of my French law diploma with a Romanian law diploma, which was very
                    easy. The professors testing me had studied with the same professors I had
                    studied with in Paris. The presiding professor said, “Who are we to question
                    your qualifications if our professors have given you a diploma?” I returned home
                    and submitted my papers and entered the Romanian bar. And for the next seven
                    years I exercised my attorney's practice.</p>
                <p>In 1937, in December, the King of Romania, Carol the Second, was finally
                    compelled to form a semi-Fascist government. I expect that he feared
                    assassination if he didn't, because the rulers of the country had become the
                    Iron Guard, a highly organized, anti-Semitic, pro-Hitlerite group. And when in
                    early January 1938 I opened one of the local papers and read that despite the
                    fact that I was a Romanian citizen and a member of the bar and all the rest I
                    would have to, as a Jew, obtain permission from the police each time I wanted to
                    go to the movies with my friends — and my friends were Jews and Christians and
                    believers and non-believers — I said to my family, my mother, “This is the end,
                    I'm leaving the country forever.” I had my passport always in my desk, and
                    reluctantly they agreed, so I packed my suitcases and went back to Paris, hoping
                    that I could earn a living there. No sooner had I arrived in Paris than the
                    French government, in its wisdom, published a decree prohibiting non-resident
                    foreigners from obtaining permanent jobs in France.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I had met my wife-to-be, Natasha Tumarkin, the sister of a friend
                    of mine who had got married and moved to the United States. Under his influence,
                    and the influence of the circumstances, we decided to do the same. We got
                    married at the end of December 1938, my mother in the meantime having died of a
                    stroke. In January 1939 we applied for American immigration visas, and got our
                    visas after the start of World War Two. Eventually we left France via Belgium
                    and England and sailed on a British ship into New York harbor at the end of
                    October 1939.</p>
                <p>Organization and Early Programming of VOA Russian Service</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the VOA Russian Service organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FRENKLEY: The Service was small in the beginning. I was very soon charged not
                    only with aspects of the programming but also mainly of editing, and writing
                    certain scripts, mainly in the cultural field and the economic field. I wrote
                    for five or six years the weekly Economic Roundup. Occasionally I would write
                    news if need be. Victor Fransuzoff and a few others were assigned to writing
                    news and nothing but.</p>
                <p>The programming at that point was limited in nature, as I recall. We had the
                    news, of course. So far as political material was concerned, if memory serves me
                    well, the only political material at the beginning was a review of the American
                    press, editorial opinion. So far as I remember, there was no commentary and no
                    political analysis in the early period of the Russian broadcasts. It later took
                    the form of a political commentary, if you want, called the Washington Observer,
                    which, so far as I remember, came to us from Washington, through Charlie Thayer,
                    with policy clearance. Of course, whatever we did was subject to policy
                    clearance at the beginning. Every news item, every line, was checked by Nabokov
                    as the expert in Russian and Charlie Thayer from the political point of view. We
                    got the news from the newsroom, but they checked the transformation of the
                    English original into Russian.</p>
                <p>Now we had, all of us, to completely adapt, or readapt, our writing ability, to
                    the needs of shortwave broadcasting — in short sentences, as much as possible in
                    simple sentences to avoid complex syntax. The Russian language has very many
                    long words. We had to try to make it as simple as possible. We had to make sure
                    we didn't use too many sibilant sounds, which are also typical of some of the
                    Russian words and sounds. These technical details — to master them in seven
                    weeks is practically impossible. That's where Eddie Raquello came in. He trained
                    us day and night. We worked like slaves.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I had to do a basic guide for feature script writers. Length in lines, reading
                    time approximately so many minutes; we had an average established speed of 12
                    Russian lines per minute, so that we'd be clear. Start every feature script with
                    a few lines of introduction to the specific subject, to be spoken by the
                    announcer. Close every feature script with a standard paragraph provided for the
                    particular feature group, also to be read by the announcer. For the present,
                    treat the text as a one-voice or two-voice narration, or as a dialogue,
                    interview, etc. Eventually dramatization — which came very soon. I wrote a
                    dramatization of the Zenger trial — freedom of the press at the end of the 18th
                    century. Style — how did I know! Well, of course, from Raquello. Use brief,
                    clear sentences. Avoid subordinate and compound sentences. Avoid using too many
                    technical terms. Avoid presenting too many figures in one script. Wherever
                    possible, present round figures, easily pronounced and listened to, unless exact
                    figures are essential. All numbers must be spelled out and not printed in
                    numerals, because they take up lines of reading. Carefully check Soviet Russian
                    terminology. Transfer all measurements into the metric system. And so on. We had
                    no sooner started than, early in March, almost mid- March, President Truman made
                    his now-famous speech proclaiming the Truman Doctrine of aid to countries
                    wanting to resist Communism. The first two were Greece and Turkey. And that
                    added to the unpleasantness between the two countries. After that speech, the
                    atmosphere, the climate of relations between the Soviet Union and the United
                    States became even worse. And we had to begun to change. That's probably when
                    this Washington Observer and the permission to use more political material came
                    about.</p>
                <p>1947: Congress Threatens VOA Budget, but Relents</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In the meantime. Congress in its wisdom, by around May 1947, started questioning
                    the usefulness of the Voice of America, and of Russian broadcasts especially,
                    and refused to approve the budget. By the end of May, all the members of the
                    Russian Service received a formal notification from the Department of State that
                    our jobs were not secure, the budget not having been approved as of that date,
                    and that no one would object if any one of us would start looking for another
                    job — without, of course, any kind of compensation for the time lost. I called
                    the chief of the Russian translation services of the then fledgling United
                    Nations, who was the father of our good friend Stan Barsky, Peter
                    Grigorovich-Barsky, a very famous name in the history of Russian attorneys and
                    law. So I came to see him at Lake Success. I passed the test with flying colors.
                    He said he would call me back, and if other friends want to do the same here are
                    some forms to give them. A couple of weeks passed, and there was still no budget
                    for the Voice of America. We were working by inertia, waiting for an order to
                    stop. I called Mr. Grigorovich-Barsky at the UN and he told me that although my
                    test was excellent, and some of my friends', the Soviet delegation to the United
                    Nations had vetoed the hiring of anyone connected with the Russian Service of
                    the Voice of America. That was in early June 1947, less than half a year after
                    we had been assembled and a few months after we had started — which shows to
                    what extent the Soviet government already at that time was dead set against the
                    Voice of America Russian broadcasts. I reported to Charlie Thayer, and perhaps
                    it helped in a modest way, but in any case the House of Representatives reversed
                    itself and approved a modest budget for the Voice. So we all kept our jobs.</p>
                <p>By then the U.S. Government had decided to add the Ukrainian Service to the Voice
                    of America and, if I recall, it was toward the end of 1947 or maybe early 1948.
                    I think they celebrated their fortieth anniversary this year, 1987. By the end
                    of 1947, I was promoted to editor-in-chief, which was a title, not that I was in
                    charge of the whole operation. Charlie Thayer was still there, Nabokov was still
                    there, but I had the title and the authority that goes with it.</p>
                <p>1948: Early Security Problems: Nikki Nabokov,A Principal Founder of VOA Russian
                    Service Ousted</p>
                <p>In 1948, problems began to arise with some of our people, not many, including
                    Nikki Nabokov, when Truman announced his program of loyalty and security checks.
                    In connection with Nabokov I don't want to expostulate on the reasons for it but
                    they were of a doubtful character. Maybe part of it was rumor, probably most of
                    it was rumors, but he was forced out. And by the middle or end of 1948 for all
                    practical purposes he stopped working. He had been an extremely valuable man. He
                    was a kind of Renaissance man. He was a brilliant musician and composer, and he
                    carried a weekly commentary on musical life in the United States, which he wrote
                    and voiced himself and illustrated with music excerpts — it was brilliant. He
                    also helped hire a number of his friends, of a very high intellectual level,
                    including such well-known figures as Arthur Lurie, a composer of perhaps second
                    rank but very distinguished, then Alexander Nazarov, who was a writer and
                    commentator on literature. And even these people had to undergo the Raquello
                    training.</p>

                <p>1948: Alexander Barmine, Former Soviet General, Defects Comes to Voice as
                    Director, Russian/Ukrainian Branch; His Background</p>
                <p>Some time toward the end of 1948, Charlie Thayer was appointed Director of the
                    Voice of America. And then he appointed me as acting chief of the Russian
                    Service, as he put it in his memorandum, “vice myself.” In other words, I was
                    acting in his stead. Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian Service being in the
                    process of organization, Alexander Barmine was hired as the future chief of the
                    Russian and Ukrainian Branch, it being understood that I would work under his
                    authority, taking care of the Russian Service, and he would supervise both me
                    and the Ukrainian Service.</p>
                <p>He had come to the United States in 1938 or 1939, and as soon as war was declared
                    he joined the army. He had been a brigadier general in the Soviet army and
                    Soviet military attach� in Athens. In 1937, the Stalin purges annihilated the
                    Soviet high command, including Marshal Tukhachevsky, who was a good friend of
                    Barmine from the time they had attended together the famous Soviet Frunze
                    military academy. And when Barmine heard about Tukhachevsky's arrest and got an
                    order to return to Moscow at the same time, he refused. He broke with the Soviet
                    regime, stayed for a short while in Athens, and then moved to Paris, where he
                    was taken under the wing of Isaac Don Levine. He started writing his book, the
                    first among the books of “non-returners,” as they were called then, and the most
                    brilliant: “One Who Escaped.” Isaac Don Levine translated it into English. And
                    through Levine he became good friends with such former Trotzkyites as Max
                    Eastman, Eugene Lyons and others who had become violent anti-Stalinists. They
                    probably had a hand in recommending him, because the mood in the State
                    Department I think also was changing, under the influence of all the events.</p>
                <p>Soviet Government Attacks VOA; Begins Jamming Broadcasts;1949: VOA Enters Cold
                    War Era Broadcastings</p>
                <p>One event I must mention, as Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith mentions in his book.
                    In April 1947, Ilya Ehrenburg, the well-known, repeatedly turncoat, Soviet
                    writer and pamphleteer, back in the Soviet Union and in the good graces of the
                    Stalin regime, came out with two consecutive rabidly violent anti-Voice of
                    America articles in the Soviet newspaper “Culture and Life,” which was a sign
                    that something was going to be wrong. In 1948, the Soviet government started
                    occasional jamming, sporadic. It was not properly reported. Then, a year later,
                    I remember very well — it was Easter Sunday in April 1949 — we were advised — I
                    was called at night, at my home — that systematic and complete jamming of the
                    Russian broadcasts of the Voice of America had started. And within days and
                    weeks, we got orders, participated in discussions and so on, to make features
                    short, and all other technical changes that were necessitated. And that went on
                    and on, and the ambassador (Smith) reflects on this fact. He says that he was
                    surprised that they waited so long to start jamming.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So, from then on the Voice of America was in the midst of the Cold War, and it
                    affected our programming, the tone of our broadcasts and everything else. We did
                    not become vituperative. In May 1947 I wrote a script about the way the city of
                    New York handled the problem of smallpox — non- political, as you can see. But
                    then in November, November 7, 1947, the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, I
                    wrote a script in connection with the 30th anniversary of the Russian Revolution
                    and went into the history of the American Revolution — American ideals and
                    philosophy. And of course there were digs. I was permitted already at the end of
                    1947 to have a dig like this, for instance: “The American Government is based on
                    the agreement of the majority. If such an agreement of the majority does not
                    exist, if a minority dictates its will to the people and thereby becomes
                    tyrannical, the people have the right to change that government. There is
                    another political philosophical point of view, in which the minority assumes the
                    right to overthrow the existing government, and by this coup to decide the fate
                    of the majority.” Et cetera. This was the first attempt.</p>
                <p>In August 1949, I sent a copy of another script to Charlie Thayer and said, “Hope
                    you'll like it,” and he said, “Excellent!” The subject was People's Democracy.
                    “The Voice of America will supplement the answer of Radio Moscow to the question
                    of 'What is a country of People's Democracy?'" Then we go into the question of
                    what a people's democracy is and what it isn't. And that was a very sharp
                    article, which made it to the papers: “Moscow Radio Quiz Answered by U.S.
                    Voice.”</p>
                <p>The Service grew in size, modestly, not so much in full-time staffing as by
                    attracting outside contributors from among the Russian intelligentsia, which
                    represented refugees either from immediately after the Revolution or those who
                    had come to the United States in the twenties and thirties, or during and after
                    the war.</p>
                <p>Barmine's Influence on VOA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Barmine's influence and the changes under
                        his leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: Under Barmine's influence there was some sharpening of the output. He
                    arrived in October or November 1948. I soon became his right-hand man, in
                    addition to my duties of supervising the Russian Service. Not that I shared many
                    of his views, but I shared some of them, and of course his entirely Soviet
                    background was anything but my background. I was a bourgeois capitalist by
                    formation; he was not. But he was, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many
                    others, a politically extremely astute mind, a very intelligent man, perhaps not
                    so much by education as in a natural sort of way, innate intelligence. Of
                    course, he was entirely anti-Soviet. But he did not let this influence his
                    editorial or executive ability, except in matters of discussing policy, trying
                    to influence policy. If policy was determined, and we were given some central
                    material to carry, he would be the first to make sure that we did, if he
                    approved of it. If he did not, he would go back to the authorities and fight it
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard he used to appear to ignore the discussion
                        during the morning policy meetings, but then would say something like
                        “Nonsense!” when someone at the table said something with which he
                        disagreed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: I do remember he would sit with his New York Times open in policy
                    meetings, but I do not remember his ever shouting “Nonsense” as some of our
                    colleagues have recalled. But it could have been, because these morning meetings
                    were very different from what I understand they have become today. They were
                    really substantive policy discussions.</p>
                <p>Volodya Mansvetov joined the Service a short time after Victor Franzusoff and I
                    did, first on purchase order, then on WAE, finally as a writer and eventually
                    editor. In my opinion, to this day no one ever wrote as well for the Russian
                    broadcasts as Vladimir Mansvetov. His style, his ability to give the gist in
                    short and beautiful Russian, was amazing. As an editor, he never tried to
                    substitute his text for the text of the writer. He corrected the writer but he
                    respected his individuality. And he gradually grew in that job, but by so doing
                    he sacrificed his first love, which was Russian literature and poetry. He
                    gradually ceased writing either poetry or prose in Russian. He knew Russian
                    literature very well, of course, he was a specialist in it. But he knew
                    amazingly well also American literature, and wrote about it brilliantly. He was
                    on the literary and feature side, but when needed he became an editor or even a
                    writer of political commentary. And when it was needed he did a brilliant job,
                    but he didn't like it.</p>
                <p>There were quite a number of contributors in the first couple of years, who came
                    and went because some of them proved to be anything but useful, but they
                    represented a brilliant stratum of Russian society which has disappeared from
                    the face of the earth. Or is gradually disappearing. Not so much the Russian
                    aristocracy, but the Russian intelligentsia of the old roots, with that immense
                    breadth of knowledge and education.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>In the beginning, there was no effort to preserve the traditional Russian culture
                    among the listening audience. For quite some time, the task of the Voice of
                    America was to reflect America and present America and nothing but. The Russian
                    element was occasional, as a comparison, but there was no effort to preserve
                    “Russian culture” in the first couple of years. This began to change when the
                    displaced persons camps, the DP camps, in West Germany and elsewhere began to be
                    emptied under the special immigration laws the U.S. Government had passed, and
                    these people began arriving in large numbers in the United States. With the help
                    of Barmine mainly, who also went to Munich to recruit people, several of these
                    people joined the ranks of the Russian Service, and by then the Ukrainian
                    Service. And although their intellectual background was far weaker than the one
                    of the old Russian intelligentsia, those he selected were very gifted people. An
                    example: Peter Veres, as he was officially known, Peter Uranov as he signed his
                    scripts, became our best writer on agricultural matters. He had been a Cossack,
                    a poor Cossack of the Kuban area. He had lived in total misery. But his family
                    and his friends were all farmers, peasants, and he knew something of the
                    experience of farming in Russia. But he was also a natural intellect, and while
                    he had difficulty with the English language he absorbed America very quickly,
                    and he became a brilliant contributor. A very miserable man, because he was
                    never able to feel adapted to the new country. He knew the country, but never
                    felt at home. And he married an American girl and had five children.</p>
                <p>And there were others, like Irgizov, who was a former inmate of a Soviet
                    concentration camp. He became a brilliant political writer. Of course, that was
                    already at the time not only when Barmine was increasing political material in
                    the programming but when the critical, anti-Soviet element in the programming
                    was becoming very important. So this influx of DPs had an impact.</p>
                <p>1952: Frenkley Sent to Munich to Set Up DirectRussian Broadcasts From Munich to
                    USSR</p>
                <p>In 1952, when Foy Kohler was director of the Voice, he asked me to go to Munich
                    and help set up direct Russian broadcasts from the Munich Radio Center,
                    addressed not only to the Soviet Union proper, but through medium wave to the
                    Soviet army of occupation in East Germany and Eastern Europe. So I went in April
                    and spent three months in Munich. When I arrived at the Frankfurt airport I was
                    met by Perry Harten representing VOA in general, not Munich at that point, and
                    on the way by car from Frankfurt to Munich I asked him whether he had anyone
                    cleared for employment. He said yes, there was one young girl of about 18 or 19.
                    “I gave her texts to translate,” he said, “and apparently she did a brilliant
                    job because I showed it to some people who know Russian and she had done a
                    beautiful job in news and press reviews.” I asked whether she was available and
                    he said she was. I asked what her name was, and he said Natalie von Meyer. And
                    today, 35 years later, she is the head of the Russian Service. And that gives me
                    satisfaction, because when I saw her and checked her translations myself I came
                    to that conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>My first stop was in Frankfurt, for consultation with the NTS, the “National
                    Labor Union,” which was an anti-Soviet emigre organization, which exists to this
                    day. They were putting out a newspaper, financed by the Americans, and a monthly
                    magazine. I had a meeting with the directors and asked whom they could recommend
                    from among their contributors, and they gave me one name, that of Alexander
                    Kazantseff. They were reluctant to part with him, but since they had an American
                    master behind their back they couldn't say no. He proved to be a brilliant
                    political writer, although his knowledge of English was extremely limited.
                    Nelson Chipchin was sent as a future deputy to the future chief, who was Charlie
                    Malamuth. They both arrived toward the end of May after I had set up the whole
                    service, practically speaking, in the building of the American Consulate
                    General, the Consul General being — Charlie Thayer. Which helped, of course.
                    Whenever we needed anything, I just went to Charlie at the other end of the hall
                    and he gave whatever was necessary. But by then of course it was Cold War
                    outright, and that lasted for a long time.</p>
                <p>Return to Discussion of Barmine Influence on Voice</p>
                <p>There was one incident between Barmine and me very early in our cooperation, when
                    he raised his voice and said something to me that I didn't like. And I said to
                    him, “Alexander Grigorievich, I will not permit even you to talk to me in that
                    tone of voice and to give me that kind of orders. I am delighted to cooperate
                    with you, and so far I think I have done it well, but if you want further
                    cooperation, treat me as your equal.” And from then on, for the next 15 1/2
                    years, there was never a bad word spoken between us. We understood each other
                    very well.</p>
                <p>We were the last editors of anything that went on the air. For years and years,
                    Mansvetov or Franzusoff or whoever else edited this or that, the requirement was
                    that while the rehearsal by the producer and the announcers of a given show was
                    taking place, both Barmine and I got copies of the newscast and each went
                    through it with a blue pencil. If we found anything that in our opinion was
                    wrong, we went to the rehearsal people and asked them to change this or that.
                    Most often Barmine's corrections and mine coincided. Very often we consulted
                    each other before sending it to the rehearsal. If it was a feature script we had
                    to see every one before it went into the recording session. And that worked. I
                    don't recall mistakes — there were, undoubtedly, but I don't recall the quantity
                    of mistakes that later developed. We had five programs a day. And this is where
                    my disagreement with Terry Catherman began, when he became the chief of the
                    Russian branch. But of course it was not his decision alone. To this day I
                    consider that it was a mistake to create that constant flow of programming in
                    one language that today extends to seven hours, not including night programs and
                    repeats. Not only did it strain the manpower to an enormous extent, but it
                    weakened the editorial control. It spread it among too many people. It was
                    impossible to keep track of changing news and corrections. One crowded upon the
                    other, constantly. And there is no respite, such as we had when we had several
                    programs separated by periods of preparing, working, editing and doing a good
                    job. And at the BBC, which was our mentor and example, they still have separate
                    programs. So many decades later, they still don't have this constant flow. I
                    think this is a strain from which the Service has not recovered.</p>

                        Catherman's assignment to VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1964: Barmine's Transfer Out of VOA; Terry Catherman's Arrival as Russian Service
                    Chief and His New Policy of Recruiting Young American Citizens with Russian
                    Language Ability: Frictions with Catherman</p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: I don't know who decided on Barmine's transfer, but I assume it was in
                    conjunction with the State Department, the leadership of USIA, to a great extent
                    under the influence of our Embassy in Moscow. Barmine left in February of 1964,
                    appointed to the headquarters of USIA as a special consultant, assistant,
                    whatever, to the head of the area office. He was given a special assignment, to
                    go on a recruiting trip, mainly in this country, because we were faced with this
                    six-hour block of programming so of course we needed more people. He found some
                    very talented people, some of whom are very useful to this day. He sent all the
                    materials to me. While he was on this trip, and before Catherman's arrival, I
                    was appointed acting chief of the branch. Then Clem Scerback came in to help,
                    and in May of 1964 Terry Catherman arrived. It was at the time, if you remember
                    — and the start of this trend had been during the Khruschchev thaw. Khruschchev
                    himself didn't last long, but the couple of years preceding his fall had already
                    started influencing our Embassy thinking and our superiors' thinking, perhaps we
                    should soften our output, that we should have more American voices rather than
                    pure Russian voices. And that's when Terry Catherman undertook this recruiting
                    of talented American young people from universities and colleges. Of course I
                    was one of the official examiners, appointed by the Civil Service, and we went
                    through many, many applications, and some of them were very good, such as Mary
                    Patzer. But they didn't last, because after a few years they found they could
                    live better in the USIA in general or they became frustrated because the
                    promotion policies of the Voice were — and still are, in my opinion — very
                    poor.</p>
                <p>I can't complain. I got my first promotion within a year after I entered the
                    service, my second promotion one year later, and then I waited for ten years.
                    From 1949 to 1959 I was a GS-13, as deputy to Barmine, who was a 14. And then
                    something happened that to this day is amazing to me, knowing our bureaucracy.
                    Henry Loomis was director at that time. One day his secretary called Barmine's
                    office and asked him to assemble all the most important people in the service in
                    his office. He came to the office, with a paper in his hand, and addressed me.
                    He said, “Alex, on the recommendation of Alex Barmine, I have the papers here
                    appointing you officially deputy branch chief, at the same grade as your boss,
                    GS-14.” Which was unheard of for the bureaucracy at that time — a deputy having
                    the same grade as the chief. But here was Loomis doing it on the recommendation
                    of Barmine, which was very touching to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>In those early (post-Barmine) days, Mike Hanu helped with the new format with a
                    number of scripts. He is a very talented script writer. He worked with me, and
                    he worked with Clem Scerback, and for some time with Terry Catherman, but
                    Catherman didn't like other people to tell him what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the various groups making up the Russian
                        Service, with their different backgrounds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: From the beginning, staffers had to be American citizens with a native
                    knowledge of Russian. There was no exception to that rule. Supposedly, as
                    American citizens, they knew something about the United States and the American
                    way of life. The second group were selected people from the ranks of Displaced
                    Persons who had been admitted to this country. They had influence of various
                    kinds. All of them were rabidly anti-Stalinist and anti-Soviet. But their
                    influence was felt when they were asked, sometimes behind our backs, by higher
                    authorities, to monitor our output, our scripts. When I heard anything about the
                    criticisms, that was through Al Puhan, who was program manager. Some of these
                    criticisms came from Munich, from released DPs who were still in Munich. Some of
                    them were here already. Under the circumstances, in the political climate of
                    that day, some of the remarks and criticisms were well taken, and were taken
                    into consideration. Some of them were of a self-serving nature. They thought, as
                    many do, that if they criticized what is going on they will be hired to improve
                    it, to change it, to throw out those they don't like, et cetera. You know very
                    well how it works.</p>
                <p>Then there was the Catherman era of Young Americans, who spoke Russian, sometimes
                    excellently, like Bill McGuire or Mary Patzer, and some others — Jill Dougherty,
                    a lovely girl from Chicago. But some spoke with a heavy American accent, which
                    was supposed to charm a Soviet listener but in fact impeded his listening
                    properly to the content.</p>
                <p>And then there is this recent crowd of arrivals. Soviet emigres; but here I would
                    say I should refrain from characterizing them because all this happened after I
                    had retired, and I only know — either from hearsay or when I wrote my scripts
                    and some of them started editing — that they knew best, they always know best.
                    But that is a matter of authority, to edit or not to edit, that is something
                    else. But they brought with them — not in general, but some of them — those
                    elements of Soviet life which had become ingrained in their nature, because
                    that's where they grew up, in those circumstances.</p>
                <p>An Example of Barmine's Defence of Russian in McCarthy Era</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>This had never happened before. In all the long years of Barmine's stewardship,
                    and my being his deputy, we did not have this kind of climate. He was the most
                    passionate defender of the Russian Service and of all who worked there. During
                    the McCarthy years, I remember one occasion, it was a Sunday and I was on duty,
                    in the Fisk Building. My door, as always, throughout my career, was open. There
                    was never a case, except for a confidential conversation, that it would be
                    closed. Suddenly I see Roy Cohn appearing on my doorstep — on Sunday, at the
                    Voice of America Russian Service. “Is General Barmine here?” I said, “No, but
                    may I help you?” He said, “No, I have to see General Barmine on a confidential
                    matter.” I said, “You'll have to come tomorrow, or call him up.” So he left. I
                    immediately called Barmine and told him about it. He said, “Don't worry.”
                    McCarthy at that time had a headquarters in New York located in the Waldorf
                    Astoria towers. Barmine called up and asked for an appointment for Monday
                    morning. He went there, and he spoke to McCarthy, and he said, “If any of your
                    assistants ever dares to come to the Russian Service you will hear from me, and
                    others will hear from me. I categorically prohibit your representatives from
                    coming to the Russian Service and demoralizing it.” And he defended us from any
                    kind of criticism or attack on the part of McCarthy. He never dared say a word
                    about the Russian Service. Barmine of course was beyond suspicion, from the
                    point of view of the anti-Communist crusaders.</p>
                <p>Comments on Differing Views of VOA Programming; Critique of Recent Programming
                    Blurring of Program Turf Between VOA and Radio Liberty</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been differing views of the proper content of
                        VOA Russian output among different groups, both American and Russian,
                        haven't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: There was very little difference in views during those Barmine years,
                    perhaps because the Cold War, which lasted so long, had created a certain
                    permanent climate. We never vituperated, we never exaggerated, but we never
                    refrained during all those years from criticizing the Stalin regime and the
                    Soviet and Communist ideology as such.</p>
                <p>However, in recent years, if I understand correctly, the tendency, especially
                    under the influence of incoming emigres — under the influence of Solzhenitsyn
                    and others who have become very active in the emigre area — writers, artists,
                    etc. — they want ever more Soviet materials, or Russian material, in the output
                    of the Russian Service, to such an extent that some of the remaining old-timers
                    say, this is not the Voice of America any more. After all, this is supposed to
                    be the Voice of AMERICA. If America has something to say about Doctor Zhivago,
                    the great novel of Boris Pasternak, fine. But we have been giving extensive
                    broadcast readings of novels that have not appeared in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Here is what I consider a great and fundamental mistake: the merging of tasks of
                    Radio Liberty and the Voice of America. It started by giving lengthy readings of
                    Solzhenitsyn's “Gulag” and others of his works. Then they went over to readings
                    of some other Soviet writers. Sometimes it was in the form of interviews, in
                    which the author read in his own voice, which may have been very effective, for
                    all I know. When the autobiography by Rostropovich's wife, Galina Vishnevskaya,
                    appeared, titled “Galina,” they got in touch with her, she has the Russian
                    manuscript of the book — which is very well written, I must say, very sharp,
                    very anti-Communist, and she agreed to read excerpts from that book in her own
                    voice. The tapes were sent from Paris, where she lives, to Washington, and used
                    as a series. Then there were readings from Aksyonov, who lives in Washington
                    now; he was a fellow of the Kennan Institute for a while. Today I saw a script
                    of a reading from Doctor Zhivago. It is now going to be published in the Soviet
                    Union, and Radio Liberty already read it. Also, there is an insistence on
                    including as much material as possible on Soviet life. Soviet events, what is
                    going on there. We may lose track of what the Voice of America is all about. And
                    I think this is a mistake.</p>
                <p>I don't say that what we have to do is to return to what I was initially asked to
                    do. Here is a form I worked out for planning the programs, with two features
                    scheduled each day on the same one-hour show. There was a newscast at the
                    beginning, there was a news summary in the middle and another at the conclusion,
                    but the main substance of each show was Americana in two kinds of features, and
                    I had the task of establishing a program for every week. The New York Times
                    translated our first program into English and published it, and commented on it.
                    Here is Feature A, February 17, 1947, the first program. The first feature was
                    on states' rights, under the section Law and the Constitution. Feature B:
                    Science — Pyribenzamine, which was a recent discovery. Agriculture —
                    fertilizers. Sociology — Veterans in College...the GI Bill of Rights. Literature
                    - Chekhov... not Chekhov in Russia, but Chekhov on the American stage, and his
                    general popularity in America. Americana — foreign correspondents, what they do
                    and how they go about it. Medicine - Streptomycin. Music Review — American
                    composers; this was Nabokov. You see the lengths: 15 minutes, 8 minutes, 9,
                    9:40, 14:20. Friday: Industry and Technology — Telephones in New York City.
                    Clarence Day. Special feature for George Washington's Birthday. Labor and
                    Management — American Federation of Labor. On Sunday we had Art and History —
                    Museum of Modern Art, and the first U.S. Minister to Russia.</p>
                <p>That pattern went through many weeks and months. And then I changed the format to
                    include a Reporter's Notebook, a weekly featurette describing advances in
                    material and cultural standards of living of the American people. More feature
                    items: Interview with Paul Hoffman of the ECA. Description of states. Eisenhower
                    as President of Columbia University. First Russian-American trade agreement. As
                    so on and so on. Here was one of the exceptions to the rule of concentrating on
                    American culture: a feature dedicated to the golden jubilee of the Moscow Art
                    Theater. Not only was it the golden jubilee, but the American theater was very
                    instrumental in using and spreading the Stanislavsky method.</p>

                        broadcasts to the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRENKLEY: My definite opinion is that it has increased and not been reduced. We
                    have to take all the advantage possible after this opening up of airwaves
                    penetration into the Soviet Union. We have listeners. In the beginning, the
                    impression was that only the city dwellers and intellectuals were listening to
                    us. But as the Embassy began to collect impressions, it became clear that the
                    provincial towns, where the reception was better, were interested, and
                    eventually farmers and peasants, kolkhozniks. There was no doubt at any time
                    that the Red Army personnel — I'm not speaking of the generals — especially in
                    the occupation areas, they all had radio receivers, and they were very much
                    interested. So eventually, our audience in our evaluation became the widest
                    possible audience. Then we discovered, especially with the introduction of
                    music, American music, in 1963, that we had conquered the Soviet youth. This was
                    a sort of come-on, but it became an extremely important element of the
                    attachment to VOA and eventually to Western broadcasts altogether. But VOA was
                    always the source of American music, jazz and rock, and nowadays even country
                    music. And they all love it, as we can see from the papers. They are listening
                    to music, or to a description of American fashions, or to trends among American
                    young people — it all influenced them enormously, and it should continue to do
                    so.</p>
