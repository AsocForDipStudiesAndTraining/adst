                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 24th of October 1996, and this is an
                        interview with William H. Lewis. Bill and I are old friends. This is for the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Bill, let's start sort of ab initio, let's start at the beginning.
                        Could you tell me when, where you were born, and something about your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I was born in New York, grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and the reason was my
                    father, a mining engineer with Anaconda Copper — but his background was even
                    more, how shall I put it, adventuresome. He actually was Welsh by origin, and
                    grew up in South Africa. During World War I, serving under General Smuts, he
                    helped chase a famous German general through East Africa ... never did find the
                    fellow, but came down with malaria. And then, after the war, served as a British
                    District Officer in Nigeria and, later, in Sudan. He subsequently returned to
                    South Africa and was awarded a degree in Mining Engineering. In due course, he
                    migrated to the United States and was offered a position with Anaconda
                    Copper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he meet your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: He met her in New York when he was at a conference, and they became
                    engaged, and in due course, married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about your education, growing up
                        in Arizona? When were you born, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LEWIS: I was born June 4, 1928; this was the period when Charles Lindbergh became
                    well known. I was little known, but subsequently determined to rectify that. I
                    went through school in Tucson, attended Amphitheatre High School, the University
                    of Arizona, briefly, but then I came East to get married, and matriculated at
                    George Washington University; also took degrees and studied at Johns Hopkins
                    University, the School of Advanced International Studies, and went to Oxford for
                    a period of time — for a bit of “seasoning” and get Arizona out of my system —
                    and then returned and finished up with a doctorate degree at American University
                    in Middle Eastern and African Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you to Middle Eastern and African
                        Studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Family heritage; my father's background and interests. He had also served
                    during World War I under General Allenby in the Middle East, and was a bit of an
                    Arabist himself. As a result of this, he provided all the romantic stories one
                    does to offspring about the great Middle Eastern Arab world, and so forth. So it
                    was all part of family tradition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get your Ph.D.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I was awarded a Ph.D. in June 1960; it was based upon the pure research I
                    did under a Ford Foundation fellowship in North Africa living among Arab tribes
                    in Morocco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk a little about your thesis, or your
                        dissertation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: The dissertation was an effort to evaluate political dynamics in a tribal
                    community. It was a study of a clan group called the Zaire tribe; they were
                    originally of Arab ancestry. They arrived in Morocco in the 11th century, and
                    became Berberized; they, over time, reversed the usual historic process. Usually
                    the Berber population, the original inhabitants, were the ones who became
                    Arabized by way of culture, language, and religion — but here was an Arab tribe,
                    a very small minority group, an offshoot of the famous Zemmour tribe doing the
                    opposite. By becoming Berberized, they had scandalized their fellow Arabs; in
                    disgrace, they retreated as a tribal community into a narrow gorge area called
                    the Khorifla-Gorge. The Gorge was an effective defensive redoubt. There they
                    became essentially shepherds and farmers. What attracted me to study them was
                    the reversal of cultural assimilation processes. Why an Arab tribe would turn
                    toward Berber culture? They, however, became influential in Moroccan politics
                    after independence in 1956, and one of their leaders was appointed senior
                    minister in the government of Sultan Mohammed V, Mohammed ben Youssef, who to
                    this day, is regarded as the George Washington of the Moroccan struggle for
                    independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So they were a fascinating group, and what I was trying to do was to determine
                    what shaped their attitudes, their opinions, in terms of government, both local,
                    regional, and national, and what their aspirations were in the post-independence
                    period. The title of the dissertation was “The Jackal-Eaters of Romani” — they
                    were jackal-eaters, which also was forbidden food according to Arab culture and
                    tradition. The full title was “The Jackal-Eaters of Romani: A Study in Tribal
                    Politics”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960 you got your doctorate; what did you do with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I put it on the wall! No, I had actually taken leave of the Department of
                    State to do this work; I had been in the Department of State for about five
                    years, in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, then under the direction of
                    Allen Evans, and I decided that if you were going to do a good job in the
                    intelligence and the research field, you should go on and get a Ph.D. So I was
                    approved a leave of absence once I was awarded a Ford Foundation Overseas
                    Fellowship in 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then let's go back to the Department of State when
                        you entered. You entered about 1955, would that be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '52. You went into INR, Intelligence and Research; what
                        area of INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I specialized in North African affairs, and that's why the Department
                    agreed to a leave of absence to work abroad on a dissertation. Since I was
                    specializing in the region where I was going to be doing the study, they thought
                    it was worthwhile, improving one's skills in Arabic and French, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your concentration on North Africa, was that basically
                        the Maghreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Basically, it was the Maghreb, which in Middle Eastern Studies Program
                    terms embraced Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but my area of responsibility in
                    due course extended eastward to include Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somaliland.
                    So it was sort a northern stretch; the only territory that was excluded was
                    Egypt, which fell within the Near Eastern Branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, an interesting time because Arab
                        nationalism was just beginning to get on its feet, and Nasser was coming
                        along. While you were in INR, what was the view of whether North African and
                        Arab nationalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: It was directed towards Arab nationalism in'52; pan-Arab nationalism came
                    later with the rise of Gamal Abdul Nasser, which would be 1954-1956 but he
                    didn't really assume supreme importance in Egypt until 1957, after the Suez
                    invasion the previous year. It was General Naguib who was in charge of the
                    Egyptian government in the initial post-1952 coup period.</p>
                <p>In 1952, you must remember, the Cold and Korean Wars were upon us. The U.S. had
                    developed an approach to the Maghreb which was called the Defense in Depth
                    strategy; this was developed shortly after the formation of NATO. The belief in
                    military circles was that we really couldn't defend the narrow waist of Western
                    Europe; we just didn't have the military manpower and materiel. Therefore, we
                    needed to have a geographic fallback position. What was adopted was this Defense
                    in Depth strategy, which was predicated on our experiences in World War II, the
                    strategy being one in which we, together with the British and the French, would
                    build military bases in North Africa. Consonant with that strategy, for example,
                    we negotiated the Caffrey-Bidault Agreement in 1951, which permitted us to
                    construct four Strategic Air Command bases in Morocco, plus access to a Naval
                    Air Facility called, in those days, Port Lyautey, but is now Kenitra, and also
                    an intelligence collection station, or listening station, at Bounadel. In
                    addition, we constructed the famous air base, Wheelus Field in Libya.</p>
                <p>For their part, the British and the French, consonant with strategy, strengthened
                    their military positions in the area. For example, the French built or added to
                    facilities in Morocco and Tunisia, where they had a protectorate agreement, as
                    well as in Algeria, which was regarded as part of metropolitan France. The
                    British built military facilities in Cyrenaica in the eastern province of Libya,
                    together with strengthening military facilities that they had available to them
                    in the Suez Canal area.</p>
                <p>Well, military necessity shaped our attitudes and our policy with respect to Arab
                    nationalism during this period. By 1951-52, in the case of Morocco, then Sultan
                    Mohammed V, was publicly aligning himself with the Istigal Party and other
                    independence minded nationalist movements there, thus outraging the French. In
                    due course, in 1953, he was deposed and sent, along with his young son, Hassan,
                    the present ruler of Morocco, and his young sister, to Madagascar in exile. The
                    U.S. government, quite frankly, didn't utter a word of protest, even though the
                    removal of the Sultan was the product of blatant French machinations. If you
                    want to go into that I can give you the whole background, in due course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't think we need to on this, but looking at it
                        from the INR point of view and the State Department, I mean, our role was
                        passive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, the U.S. policy was passive. INR itself was divided: those of us,
                    myself included, on the North African side, tended to be somewhat more
                    sympathetic to local aspirations for independence, whereas those in the European
                    section of the Bureau tended to support the French and British positions in the
                    early 1950s. But both of our disagreements counted for little since overriding
                    strategic interest and high policy were determined elsewhere. The intelligence
                    community might look and examine nationalist movements, their leadership, and
                    regional dynamics, but that didn't mean that its assessments could help shape
                    policy on contentious issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a lot of conversation and talk in INR
                        about 'we should be doing this;' or 'we should be doing that'? I mean, or
                        was there a general sort of understanding that well, defense of Europe comes
                        first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: You had a situation which was essentially schizoid; good researchers,
                    intelligence officers, were continually trying to collect information on
                    leaders, key leaders of nationalist movements, their base of support, and so on,
                    leaving to Defense Department officials the responsibility of looking at
                    military requirements and military threats. Our collection and evaluation
                    efforts were basically directed towards the strengths or weaknesses of the
                    nationalist movements, where their domestic support came from, and their
                    external sources of support. For example, Moscow was providing some material
                    assistance. With the rise of Nasser, his government became a significant
                    channel, providing substantial amounts of assistance. External influence was
                    accorded high priority and this was the principal subjects we were tracking at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before the Wriston Program. Could you talk about
                        how INR was constituted, and who were the people, the ones you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: INR basically consisted of three types of specialists. The first group in
                    that early period were recruits from the World War II OSS, who hadn't entered
                    the CIA but became part of the INR “Old Guard”. 'The second group consisted
                    largely of young fellows, such as myself, who were research scholars and area
                    specialists. We came in through the Civil Service. And then you had Foreign
                    Service Officers who were assigned to the Bureau for brief tours; most were
                    specialists who tended to regard their period of service in INR as a sort of
                    banishment or exile since they were out of the policy mainstream. Most of the
                    latter I encountered regarded INR assignment as temporary captivity.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: I took my leave, in terms of the doctoral period, in 1958, and then came
                    back early in 1960.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I was reassigned to INR at that time, but then in due course I came under
                    the tutelage of a gentleman, Ambassador Julius Holmes, of World War II fame, and
                    became his prot�g�e. Julius felt that I should spend a bit of time in the
                    Department of Defense; he called it “seasoning”, as I recall, political/military
                    seasoning, and through his exertions, I spent three years in the Policy Planning
                    staff of ISA in the Office of Secretary of Defense, working with some people who
                    are well known these days: Morton Halperin; Leslie Gelb; Reggie Bartholomew,
                    currently our ambassador to Rome, who was himself a young scholar and
                    specialist; and several others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get attached to Julius Holmes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: It was as a result of a special task force that was organized at the
                    behest of the Secretaries of State and Defense called the State-Defense Policies
                    Study Group, called upon to deal with contemporary issues. Ambassador Holmes was
                    appointed as head of the group and directed to conduct an in-depth analysis of
                    political trends in the Middle East and North Africa. I was selected by
                    Secretary Rusk to be the person representing the State Department on the North
                    African area. The fellow who was dealing with the Near East was Curtis Moore,
                    who was later killed in Khartoum — an old friend of mine. At any rate, we worked
                    together for about a year, and apparently Julius Holmes found me irreverent but
                    responsible in my dealings with the military, and he felt that I would have a
                    useful career in pol-mil affairs if I transferred out of INR. Tom Hughes was
                    then the Director of INR, and he was somewhat opposed but as I say, I fell under
                    the spell of Julius Holmes, and I went along with career guidance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on this board under Holmes, what was your
                        impression of the planning from the Defense Department; was it a them-and-us

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LEWIS: The State-Defense group, the group with which I was associated, had
                    previously done a study on Latin America, another on East Asia, and this was
                    followed by a study on future U.S. basing requirements overseas. The basing
                    study was done at the request of the Secretary of Defense. I arrived on board as
                    the basing study was coming to conclusion — it was important from the military
                    perspective to get State Department input, because State would be responsible
                    for helping negotiate access rights and status of forces agreements. My
                    impression when I arrived, and throughout the period that I was with the study
                    group it was collegial nature of the effort. There was very little rancor or
                    animosity, and I thought the team worked very well together. As a matter of
                    fact, I think today the government would be well served by reconstituting such
                    joint efforts.</p>

                        you can recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Across the geographic board, Curtis and I were covering all of the Middle
                    East as well as North Africa, in which issues such as arms transfer policies,
                    how to deal with the rising Arab nationalism in the area, how to deal
                    essentially with the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Arabs — not just
                    the Palestinians — and one of the equally challenging issues, the future of
                    post-Haile Selassie. What's likely to happen in that ancient empire called
                    Ethiopia when Haile Selassie “shuffled off this mortal coil.” So there were a
                    whole interlinking skein of issues that we were covering. To provide depth to
                    our analysis, we traveled widely. We visited with a number of the military CINCs
                    responsible for the Middle Eastern and North African affairs, with EUCOM, and
                    several others. Particularly constructive and supportive were General Lemnitzer
                    in Europe and Ambassador Bruce in London, both personal friends of Ambassador
                    Holmes. The result was a finely tuned policy report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view arms sales to Israel and to the Arab world
                        at that time, because this is before the '67 war when things changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Generally, we tended to be rather restrained and moderate in terms of
                    sales to both parties. This changed in the wake of the'67 war; President Johnson
                    decided the U.S. should tilt our arms sales policy in favor of Israel, and of
                    course, many of the old Middle Eastern hands in the Department were pretty much
                    opposed to this, but such was the Presidential decision, and that was it.
                    Unfortunately after'67 there was a dramatic tilt, one that continues to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But while you were there, it was on a....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LEWIS: The basic position was that there should be a parity of effort, in other
                    words, we should do as best we could. The problem you had at that time, in the
                    early and mid '60s, was that Nasser was not viewed as one of our friendly Arab
                    leaders in the Middle East. He had turned toward the Soviet Union for his arms
                    supplies and force training, but then we had others who were requesting
                    assistance — for example, the Moroccans were requesting military equipment, the
                    Tunisians under Habib Bourguiba, before he was dispatched by Qadhafi, King Idris
                    and his government were looking for military equipment and other forms of
                    military assistance. So one could be fairly even handed until you got closer and
                    closer to Israel, then you had a little problem as to where and how you would
                    begin to deal with Arab government requests. We were very favorably disposed
                    toward Jordan; King Hussein was regarded as a friendly Arab leader. And, of
                    course, Turkey, as a member of NATO, was a non-Arab beneficiary of our military
                    aid programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we view Nasser as a Soviet tool at this point, or
                        someone who was taking advantage of the largesse of the Soviets? How did we
                        view him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, during the Dulles period — the 1950s — he was viewed by some policy
                    makers as an implacable foe of the West, not just the United States; this
                    despite what happened in Suez in 1956. You have a carryover of this perspective
                    into the 1960s as well, particularly with the increasing number of Soviet
                    Mediterranean Fleet visits to Alexandria and the large number of Soviet military
                    advisers practicing their “magic” in Egypt. Throughout, there was a tendency on
                    the part of some people in our government to regard Nasser as a Soviet
                    surrogate. Others who were somewhat more sophisticated, would tend to view him
                    as an important, significant independent nationalist leader, but one capable of
                    a lot of mischief, as we witnessed in Yemen, where poison gas was used by
                    Egyptian forces.</p>
                <p>So you encountered divided opinion, some inclined to be more balanced in
                    appraising Nasser in terms of his constructive aspirations, others harboring a
                    negative assessment in terms of his close ties with Moscow and his misadventures
                    in Yemen and elsewhere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: That's right. When the Imperial bodyguard sought to overthrow the Emperor—
                    he was traveling abroad at the time, in Latin America — one of the remaining
                    sons aligned himself with the bodyguard, in the midst of the coup. As I recall,
                    when we helped to rush the Emperor back to Addis Ababa, the disloyal son was at
                    the airport. Selassie deplaned, looked at his son, and said, “You know, I wish
                    you weren't here.” In other words, “I wish you were dead, get out of my sight.”
                    The Emperor survived on the throne until '74, so he had a pretty good run, some
                    of our better known dictators go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were looking at this, did the problem in Algeria
                        raise its head, of what to do and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, the Algerian problem became something of a very real policy concern
                    during this period for several reasons. One, King Hassan had established very
                    cordial ties with us. His father, Mohammed V, died under strange circumstances
                    in 1960. Hassan ascended the throne, and became closely associated with us. He
                    had sent Moroccan troops to Congo, now present day Zaire, at our urging during
                    the 1960s crisis; he was clearly serving as an intermediary in Arab discussions
                    with the Israelis. So we were favorably disposed towards him. In addition,
                    despite the demand that we remove ourselves from the Strategic Air Command bases
                    in Morocco, there was a gentleman's understanding that we could keep some
                    military supplies lodged in several of them, so long as we did not provoke
                    public awareness about our presence.</p>
                <p>So King Hassan was a leader with whom we shared a community of interest, and who
                    we were inclined to support during this early 1960s period. Algeria emerged from
                    its traumatic struggle for independence in the summer of 1962, and then
                    experienced a near-civil war by mid-1962. Colonel Houari Boumedienne rushed his
                    25,000 troops to Algiers, captured the city, and declared Ahmed ben Bella
                    President of Algeria.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Well, the Moroccans became very much concerned: who was this Boumedienne? What's
                    happening in neighboring Algeria? There were border difficulties between the two
                    countries, and while they had pledged during the Algerian struggle for
                    independence that, once independence was achieved, political unification would
                    follow; it never materialized, obviously. But the Moroccans felt that while the
                    French were in charge of Algeria they had stolen Moroccan territory, and in '63
                    a really bloody border war broke out between Morocco and Algeria over a series
                    of oases called “the War of the Sands”. I remember State people getting very
                    nervous — were the Moroccans going to get defeated and with what consequences?
                    And at this time, ben Bella aligned himself with the Soviets, then Col.
                    Boumedienne, who was his Defense Minister, toppled ben Bella in'65. Because of
                    the poor performance of his troops during the “War of the Sands” turned to the
                    Soviet Union for additional military equipment. Ben Bella himself had visited
                    Cuba and aligned Algeria with Castro, proclaiming that Algeria was going to
                    become the international headquarters for national liberation movements. So
                    clearly, we and the Moroccan government were very concerned about Algeria and
                    what the dickens was happening there.</p>

                        sound analysis of what was happening, did we have any policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: We had sound analysis regarding what was happening in the region. We were
                    called upon to provide our analysis and conclusions; on two occasions, for
                    example, I was dispatched with a certain general, whose name I should not
                    provide you, to Morocco, for meetings in Rabat to assess the “Algerian threat to
                    Morocco”; the Moroccans were very agitated and feared that they might be subject
                    to a major military collision. We were seeking to calm them down. We were
                    dealing at the time with General Oufkir then security chief to King Hassan. In
                    the early '70s the military tried to get rid of Hassan....</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the famous birthday parry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, the King's birthday party, where cadets attacked the Royal palace,
                    located just outside of Rabat. The king had hidden himself away in the bathroom
                    and secured access to a phone, and was rescued. But the more famous incident was
                    the following year, when he was returning from his annual vacation in France
                    aboard his 727 airplane. Lo and behold, three American-supplied F-5 aircraft
                    attacked the 727, and riddled it. It shows the combat proficiency of the pilot
                    training we had provided the Moroccans that they failed to take the plane down,
                    with the King onboard. He engaged in a ruse, had the pilot say that the Monarch
                    was dead in the passenger cabin, and couldn't the crew be spared. The F-5 pilots
                    agreed, permitted the plane to land at Rabat-Sale airport. Out popped the King,
                    and accused Oufkir of masterminding the effort to kill him. It was reported in
                    the press a few days later that Oufkir had committed suicide — reportedly, he
                    had 14 bullet holes in his body. It stretches credulity to believe he had
                    committed suicide, but one never knows: if you couldn't down a 727....</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But to get back to the main point, we had two annual meetings with Oufkir
                    exchanging evaluations of the nature of the Algerian threat. Basically, our
                    assessment was far from alarmist when compared with that presented by the
                    general. These exchanges reflected a close relationship, a very close
                    relationship.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: I went into ISA in 1966 and stayed there until 1969; I covered the Middle

                        find working in the military? Was there a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: The culture is very different, and obviously the learned doctrine that
                    helps guide policy — the history of war, military strategy — you needed to
                    become familiar with all of it. You also needed to have some familiarity with
                    force structure analysis. That's helpful when you're doing arms transfer
                    programs, which I was assigned later on, for purposes of orientation and
                    training. It was a different world, but a professionally productive world to
                    live in, highly structured, rigorous in terms of analytical approach. When it
                    came to military questions and related policy issues, we in State just didn't
                    have enough people with the experience, knowledge of this culture; the military
                    and civilian professionals could run circles around most State Department
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had this Middle East area, and the '67 War came, when
                        Israel looked like it was on the ropes at one point, and then which turned
                        into the Six Day War, and won out, and there was a major tilt towards Israel
                        as far as arms supply and all that. How did this hit our military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: It was an interesting reaction from my perch. One, the military was
                    dazzled by the Israeli military performance, and as a result, they spent a great
                    deal of time with counterparts in the Israeli Defense Staff looking at Israeli
                    war fighting strategy, the tactics, trying as well to understand the
                    preparedness deficiencies on the Arab side.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>From the military intelligence point of view, the principal areas of interest
                    were the doctrines and tactics the Egyptians had absorbed from the Russians, and
                    how were they applied or misapplied. It was part of a learning process —
                    especially a need to collect battle assessment material. But also, to repeat,
                    there was a genuine admiration for what the Israelis were able to accomplish
                    against three major foes virtually simultaneously: the Egyptians, the Syrians,
                    the Jordanians. The respect was palpable.</p>
                <p>When it came, however, to the question of arms policy, that was more a civilian
                    type of question; the military could obviously offer advice and suggestions, but
                    the decision was largely made by civilian authorities. Even here, divided
                    counsel was evident. Some policy makers in the Pentagon were leery about tilting
                    arms supply policy too heavily in favor of Israel. They felt that there would be
                    a negative reaction in the Arab world where we needed access to bases, and this
                    could cause unanticipated difficulties.</p>
                <p>You may recall that in'67, just as the Egyptian forces were suffering this
                    humiliating defeat, Egyptian radio said that the Israelis were not supermen,
                    that in actual fact, much of the war had been conducted by the American Air
                    Force flying out of North African bases and elsewhere. Well, our DOD officials
                    acknowledged the big lie could gain credibility in terms of arms aid for Israel;
                    this could lead to a lessening of support for us in terms of access to bases and
                    special relationships. And this actually occurred. When Qadhafi, for example,
                    seized power in September of '69, he immediately called for negotiations for the
                    withdrawal of American and British bases in Libya, and we felt compelled to
                    accede.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem later after the '73 war; there were
                        screams about the supplies we were giving to the Israelis, that they were
                        drawing down on our stocks for our wars; was this a problem after the '67
                        war, or did the military feel that the supplies to Israel could go through
                        without any particular....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: There were no major problems with the general notion. We had difficulty
                    with which item of equipment would be provided; the Israelis were constantly
                    pressing for the most advanced American military technology and equipment. The
                    U.S. military tended to be reticent. You generally found that there was pressure
                    and counter pressure on this; it was not an easy exercise. It doesn't mean that
                    our military didn't want to supply some material, it was the items that were on
                    the Israeli list that became....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role; I mean, how did you fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LEWIS: In due course, I was involved in coordinating State and Defense policy in
                    arms transfers, in addition to covering the Middle East and Africa. We began to
                    turn out something called the State-Defense Policy Guidance Document on Military
                    Assistance Worldwide. This was at a time when Ron Spiers from the State
                    Department's PM Bureau was very much in favor of it. This was the time when
                    ISA's Paul Warnke thought it was a great idea. They agreed to put me in charge
                    of the effort. I was constantly negotiating with State and Defense before we
                    turned out this document. It then became the source for field guidance for all
                    of the commands and embassies after being cleared by the two Departments. It was
                    very useful. When I returned to the State Department, a member of Congress, I
                    forget who it was, secured a copy of it, and asked then-Secretary Rogers in the
                    Nixon Administration, while testifying, “Is this your document?” And Rogers
                    said, to Ron Spiers' surprise and not bemusement, “I've never seen this thing
                    before in my life.”</p>
                <p>Then we dropped the whole exercise, after Rogers had avowed that this was not an
                    official document. It was a rather frustrating experience. Poor Rogers, he just
                    was not properly briefed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Focusing on the '66-'69 period, how did we view the
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Generally, in terms of the French, we tended to regard them as competitors
                    with the United States. They began to enter, for example, the Latin American
                    arms market, which some of our people, military as well as some in the State
                    Department, regarded as American preserve. The French were flogging military
                    equipment there, and this became a sensitive issue. In due course, you may
                    recall that Senator Fulbright — I'm jumping ahead now to the early '70s —
                    insisted that we engage in what we called “a self-denying ordinance” — that we
                    would not sell “advanced” military equipment to Latin American, military
                    establishments in Latin America. In the period, I think it's '71-'74, and again
                    later on, under the Carter Administration, the same self-denying ordinance
                    applied. The British and French jumped in and they gained a tremendous amount of
                    market share, as far as advanced military equipment was concerned. That began to
                    become a question in the late '60s. If we don't sell, the French will do it, and
                    if not the French, then obviously the Russians and the like. There was little
                    collaboration you may recall. The French had pulled out of the NATO military
                    system in '67. The military relationship had begun to get a little tenuous. The
                    only place it wasn't tenuous, we now know, was on the nuclear side; we helped
                    the French develop their nuclear arsenal with technical advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were talking about Africa below the Sahara, was
                        there much demand for arms down there, and were we doing anything with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, we provided some modest amounts of military equipment in the '60s to
                    Liberia, basically because we needed military access to Roberts Field, and we
                    also had the LORAN station there, Voice of America was there, and so on. It was
                    a modest amount.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Obviously, the military advisory group sent to Liberia was not really very
                    effective in creating a 'Liberian Wehrmacht'. I know I was there in 1960 with
                    Loy Henderson, and when Loy was making his tour through Africa...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A famous tour....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: We decided to open all those posts, and I was taking somebody else around
                    Africa at the time, and we kept running in and having drinks together, and one
                    day Loy and this gentleman and myself were in Liberia. We were invited to a
                    banquet in Loy Henderson's honor, and seated on my right was a woman wearing
                    medals, and I said to her, “What exactly is your position, if I may ask?” And
                    she said, “I'm the Minister of Defense.” She wouldn't have known a rifle if she
                    fell over it, but she was part of the Tolbert clan. Obviously it worked out
                    pretty well from the Liberian perspective.</p>
                <p>We then met with the American, I think he was a Lieutenant Colonel, who was head
                    of the military advisory team there, an African-American team, very honest, and
                    we asked him whether the Liberians were militarily fit. And he said, “Sir, when
                    I tell them to go left, they go right.” He observed: “This is not an Army; I
                    just want you to know what we have here.” I said, “You're trying to
                    professionalize them?” He said, “No, we just want access to the benefits.” The
                    Liberians were armed men, but they were not soldiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, in this arms sale, again, during this
                        particular time, '66-'69, what about American firms: Lockheed, Boeing,
                        whoever makes tanks, whoever makes backpacks — in other words, were you
                        feeling the impact either through the manufacturers themselves or through
                        their Congress people about you've got to sell more stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: When I was in the Pentagon, there were a number of trade associations —
                    aerospace trade associations, and the electronics trade associations — and they
                    sought to influence policy in Defense and State — less so in State, more Defense
                    — and on the Hill trying to secure support for military sales abroad. In that
                    period, U.S. military sales were beginning to rise very rapidly, although
                    agricultural exports remained our leading export. However, the military was
                    beginning to come up for a substantial portion of market share. The associations
                    were ubiquitous. They had, of course, their natural base in the Defense
                    Department. When you retired, if you were a military man with sufficient rank,
                    you went to work for some of these firms. This was all pretty much
                    understood.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The firms were very effective in their lobbying. One of the contentious issues,
                    and it remained a contentious issue even in the Carter Administration, was
                    whether American embassies and consulates should serve as intermediaries for
                    these firms when their representatives arrived in town. Should they sponsor them
                    with local officials? Who should have primary responsibility? Should it be the
                    Commercial Officer? Should it be the Defense Attach�? If you happened not to
                    have a Defense Attach� in the area, should it be the Station Chief and his
                    people?</p>
                <p>Some of the companies were very, very successful in developing a multi-stage and
                    multi-faceted approach. They would bring some of the foreign dignitaries, Deputy
                    Ministers of Defense, and others to the States at company expense, take them
                    around their plants in an effort to enhance sales. At the same time, they were
                    lobbying Congress. A whole series of networks in operation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say you were dealing with Liberia or Iran or something,
                        where you can't do this because Congressman So-and-so is in the pocket of,
                        say, the Iranians, or Company X or Company Y, were you feeling this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, and if you had any sensitivity, you realized what was going on. There
                    was a famous case of an American Congressman who went to the Republic of Korea.
                    This particular Congressman liked his bourbon, and he liked other pursuits. The
                    Korean company in Seoul, and the government, took care of his every need. This
                    was during the period of Bill Porter, our Ambassador to the Republic of
                    Korea.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: This particular Congressman was satisfied in every way. During his last
                    evenings s�ance with a lady of the evening, she informed him that the Republic
                    of Korea was defenseless against naval attacks. He said, in his best Southern
                    twang, “My dear, I'll get you a cruiser, I promise.” He had to have certain
                    shots administered to make sure that he didn't come away from Korea with more
                    than he had gone in with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviets? One, as arms sellers, or in the
                        field you were dealing with, what role were the Soviets playing at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LEWIS: We understood the Soviet's goal was to develop a reputation as a global
                    power, not merely a European power. The Soviets were expanding their Navy at a
                    very rapid pace. This was a matter of very real concern. They were also trying
                    to flog/sell some of their naval and air force equipment. Clearly, they were
                    trying to demonstrate that they had a global reach comparable to that of the
                    U.S. As evidence, they were seeking access to home ports, and bunkering rights
                    for the Soviet Navy. As quid pro quo they were using offers of military
                    equipment to secure overflight landing rights in Africa and elsewhere. Some of
                    our ambassadors got a little hysterical and stretched, if you will, their powers
                    of analysis.</p>
                <p>There was the case of an American ambassador when news was announced in this
                    particular African country that its government had granted the Russians
                    overflight and landing rights, who dispatched this apocalyptic telegram: “And so
                    I've now lost this country from the American point of view.” His message was
                    viewed as nonsense, but it's entirely possible he was trying to get an increase
                    in AID funds by inflating the “crisis.” It produced a negative reaction,
                    probably a black mark on his record.</p>
                <p>But, clearly, what the Russians were doing was trying to establish a reputation
                    for global reach, an ability to emulate the United States. The Soviet Navy had
                    been a coastal Navy, but now covered the world. Giant Soviet aircraft were now
                    capable of shipping massive amounts of military equipment. It was part of the
                    power projection game that was going on. Russian efforts deeply concerned us at
                    the time, especially in the Middle East region.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I wasn't selling. I was involved in helping to shape policy in terms of
                    which countries and what amounts, of equipment and training should be available.
                    If I'd been out selling, I'd be a multi-millionaire and well-established in
                    Monaco.</p>

                        done very well at all. Do you ever get the feeling that we were overselling
                        the Soviet menace?</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Obviously, from a Defense Department point of view, the natural impulse
                    was to engage in worst case analysis, for obvious reasons. Soviet equipment
                    proved of varied quality. By the time we were afforded an opportunity to examine
                    some of their main battle tanks, we found they were pretty good. And I think the
                    consensus began to develop within the analytical community, military and
                    civilian, that part of the difficulty when they transferred high performance
                    equipment to Third World countries the Soviets didn't provide them with adequate
                    training or tactical indoctrination. As a result, quite often the Third World
                    recipients were not using the equipment properly. For example, the after-action
                    reports in terms of the Six Day War out of Israel was that the Egyptians just
                    simply didn't know how to deploy and operate their equipment efficiently. The
                    Egyptians learned from their mistakes and the performance in combat conditions
                    improved. They certainly proved much more effective in '73 when some of the
                    equipment, such as main battle tanks, performed well. Their surface-to-surface
                    rockets were not bad at all. Their major deficiencies were in such high
                    technology areas as electronics.</p>
                <p>Their aircraft, also, were of varied quality. I was involved in a military survey
                    mission to Sudan back in '77. I served as the senior State Department
                    representative. The mission was led by a Major General. We were looking at some
                    of the MiGs the Soviet Union had supplied to Sudan that were 30 years old at
                    least, both in technology and fire support systems. You couldn't expect the MiGs
                    to put up a good show against an American F-5. But by the time other countries
                    got into the newer generation, more contemporary stuff such as their present
                    SU-29s, they have a pretty good combat worthy aircraft.</p>
                <p>In the Third World, part of the problem was poor training, limited spare parts,
                    inadequate doctrine and orientation, and so forth. Many of the instructor pilots
                    were not very proficient, but that's the best that the Soviets made available.
                    Egyptian pilots were inferior in every respect compared to the Israeli pilots.
                    In the '73 war, though, that was offset by the better use of anti-aircraft and
                    other air defense systems. As a result, some of this advantage that the Israelis
                    clearly had in terms of pilot proficiency and aircraft capability didn't hold up
                    all that well in the initial stages of the conflict; that's why the U.S. felt
                    compelled to make aircraft replacements available to Israel in the Yom Kippur
                    War of '73. The Egyptians had learned to adjust and to adopt improved
                    tactics.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Yes. Ambassador Holmes, sadly, died in 1968 of lung cancer.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Another unanticipated development. President Nixon decided, in view of
                    Congressional criticism, to establish a Presidential Commission to examine
                    American arms transfers and economic assistance programs, a review intended to
                    meet Congressional criticism. He put together a commission headed by the
                    president of Bank of America, Rudy Peterson; designated by the White House, the
                    Peterson Task Force. A four-star general was on it, as was Cardinal Cook and
                    Bill Casey. It was a very distinguished body.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The head of the CIA, a very, let's say controversial
                        figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, I mean, he often excoriated the staff for its initial draft papers
                    and then he walked out of the plenary sessions. He had that interesting style of
                    not giving full attention, but knew all the answers anyhow. At any rate, I was
                    the designee for the Department of Defense to cover arms transfer policy issues.
                    The staff director, an old friend of mine, Ed Fried, from Brookings Institution,
                    a fine economist, served as Executive Secretary and Staff Director. I prepared
                    the military section of the report. In due course Ron Spiers, Head of PM, said,
                    “Bill, it's time for you to come back; you know too much to stay away; why don't
                    you come back and join us at the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs?” And I
                    said, “I'd be delighted.” Ron and Tom Pickering brought me back and appointed me
                    Deputy Director of the Military Assistance and Sales shop in 1970. By then we'd
                    finished the Peterson Report, it was submitted to the President. Mr. Nixon
                    received the report and approved it, and asked that some of us put together new
                    legislation to be called a “New Foreign Assistance Act,” embracing some of the
                    principles in the report I had developed. I met with State and Defense lawyers,
                    and we finally put together an impressive piece of legislation, and the White
                    House presented it to the Congress. The only thing Congress accepted and passed
                    into law was the proposal that the State Department create a new position, that
                    of Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance Coordination — the word
                    “coordination” was intended to bring together State, Defense, and AID under
                    State policy “direction”. The rest of our legislation was ignored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: The issue Congress addressed was whether there should be clearly defined
                    State Department supervision and coordination with the Department of Defense on
                    arms transfer policy and AID on supporting assistance. It was Senator Fulbright
                    who pushed for this legislation. He believed State had not provided adequate
                    oversight and policy supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was lack of White House interest the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LEWIS: I always suspected lack of White House interest in the overall package we
                    had presented to Congress. On the other hand, this was a “Democratic” Congress,
                    why give a Republican president all the White House wanted? That was my take on
                    it. At any rate, we had labored mightily, there it was, one little thing. And
                    for my — how should I put it — as my reward, I was called in by the Deputy
                    Secretary, and he said, “Now, Bill, I want you to work to set up this new Office
                    of Under Secretary for Security Assistance.” And I said, “Well, that's fine, who
                    will I be working with? “Well,” he said, “I'm going to bring back somebody who's
                    a tough old Foreign Service officer to work with you on this. His name is George
                    Newman.” I was delighted having known George for years, so I sent out a telegram
                    saying, “George, I'm really looking forward to working with you”. And back
                    channel came this message: “What a rotten development this is!” He loved his
                    existing posting as DCM, Bangkok. At any rate, an unhappy George Newman was
                    brought back to Washington. I was then being seconded for an all-out effort to
                    create the Office of Under Secretary for Security Assistance. However, the
                    assignment placed me in the middle of a delicate problem. Might we go off the
                    record on this one?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, let's stay on the record, and you can edit when you
                        want, but I think..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I have the greatest respect for Ron Spiers, I always thought he was a fine
                    fellow to work with. I was not aware at the time that he and George Newman were
                    not always on cordial terms. George never apprised me, and I was not aware of
                    when or where they had previously “crossed swords”. George and Ron simply
                    couldn't get along. Ron, I think, wanted to limit the mandate, the span of
                    control of the Office of Under Secretary for Security Assistance, because if it
                    were large, as expected, this would constrain his authority as head of PM.
                    George, of course, wanted to give the new office full authority. I was caught in
                    the middle of the controversy, and I finally said, “I've got to do something.”
                    We had temporary offices on the first floor, a magnificent suite actually.
                    George was occupying the throne room pending arrival of the Under Secretary
                    designate, and I went to Ron, and I said, “I'm going to put the two of you
                    together in the throne room, and would you please sort it out? You're killing
                    me, the two of you, because, you know, I can't serve two masters at the same
                    time.”</p>
                <p>In due course, they entered the throne room; they were in there an hour with the
                    door closed. And it was a most delicate situation for me. I was reporting to
                    Ron, my superior, and I couldn't be disloyal to George. They could not agree on
                    jurisdictions. And as the dispute persisted, AID got into the act and sent some
                    AID people to “assist.” They duly reported to the Director of AID on internecine
                    conflict in State. The Defense Department sent some officers over, who provided
                    similar input to their “masters”.</p>
                <p>We finally got the mandate, and inscribed it in the Federal Register. Later, the
                    White House informed us who the incumbent was going to be. Remember the name
                    Curtis W. Tarr?</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Curtis W. Tarr had been President of Sarah Lawrence University, but was
                    from California. When the Nixon Administration arrived in Washington, the
                    President appointed Ehrlichman and Haldeman to find a candidate to fill the
                    position. Tarr wanted a time in Washington, so they had him replace Hershey, to
                    phase out the Selective Service System. Did an excellent job, from what I
                    understand. Shortly thereafter Secretary of the Air Force Seamen announced plans
                    to retire; he'd had enough of life in Washington, and Curtis apparently was
                    promised by Haldeman and Ehrlichman that he would be nominated for Secretary of
                    the Air Force within a year. He was urged to take the position of Under
                    Secretary of State on an interim basis. He accepted.</p>
                <p>Curtis is a gentleman who had this sort of Western twangy type of accent, 6 foot
                    7 or 8, huge, tall fellow, skinny. Unfortunately, he gave the impression of
                    being a bit of a yokel. I mean, he was pretty savvy, but he just could not
                    escape that impression. For example, if ambassadors made official calls, he
                    would throw his long legs over the conference table, and say, “Tell me, pardner,
                    what's going on in your neck of the woods?”, which is hardly traditional State
                    Department style.</p>
                <p>Curtis did not succeed in his quest to become Secretary of the Air Force.
                    Watergate intruded, and Ehrlichman and Haldeman became otherwise engaged. Tarr
                    departed after a while, to pursue other activities. He went to work for John
                    Deere, Vice President of Midwest Sales. In due course I returned to PM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, this Under Secretary for ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Coordination...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coordination.... it sounds like one of those almost non
                        jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>LEWIS: It was a seventh floor State Department position. The incumbent obviously
                    was going to be resisted by AID since Security Assistance embraced the Economic
                    Supporting Assistance Program. It also included the public safety program that
                    Alex Johnson had sponsored, and of course, the military side. The Defense people
                    were not about to surrender the family jewels. It was very difficult to bring
                    them into camp. And George Newman and I then decided to put together something
                    called the Security Assistance Program Review Committee, to encourage
                    inter-agency cooperation.</p>
                <p>Well, that concept was fine, except the Pentagon was resistant to program reviews
                    under State Department auspices. AID was conducting its own reviews on the
                    grounds that if it was good enough for the Under Secretary of State to organize
                    one, AID should have its own review processes. So it really didn't quite work
                    out terribly well. Moreover, problems arose in the State Department. The
                    Geographic Bureaus and PM preferred to report to the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. They were circumventing Curtis Tarr whenever possible. It was
                    akin to rival Tong groups going at each other. And they didn't give poor Curtis
                    a chance. It's a position that has evolved away from security assistance,
                    covering technology and nuclear proliferation matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went back to Political and Military Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I went back to Political and Military Affairs just before Henry Kissinger
                    arrived as Secretary of State — it had to be '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on, by mentioning Henry Kissinger, in any
                        of the things that youwere dealing with did the National Security Council
                        play any role, I mean in talking up to this time we've already been talking
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, the role it played essentially was to provide oversight and
                    architecture for the activity that Dr. Kissinger had established. It was the
                    National Security Study Memoranda series, under which the President directed
                    that sensitive national security policy studies be conducted. It was a
                    magnificent maneuver on his part. He then created early on in the Nixon
                    Administration something on the order of eight or nine inter-agency committees.
                    Kissinger presided over each and every one of them. This afforded him a span of
                    oversight that controlled information to the President, brilliant maneuvering on
                    his part. One of the committees included arms and arms transfer related matters.
                    I don't want to enumerate each of the committees, but as a result of this
                    approach, we were directed in Tarr's office to take a look at insurgency in
                    Thailand and what counter-insurgency efforts the U.S. might support.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LEWIS: National Security Study Memorandum, '69. It directed that the Office of
                    Under Secretary for Security Assistance organize an inter-agency team to go out
                    to the field and study counter-insurgency problems up in the Chang Mai area of
                    northern Thailand. Curtis approached me and said: “Why don't you lead the team,
                    Bill, you know how to work with the military and the CIA.” I put together a team
                    of about 25 people; CIA was fully represented as were Defense and AID. We
                    proceeded to Bangkok and went up to Chang Mai. We had a splendid
                    counter-insurgency staff in our embassy in Bangkok; Bill Stokes was its
                    director; I don't know if you know Bill.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't know him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Bill was present and was exceedingly helpful, gave us all sorts of charts
                    and information. And the insurgency problem in Chang Mai was substantial and
                    some of our Embassy officers on the military side were frank to admit that the
                    Thai military wasn't doing all that well in coping. I came back to Washington
                    and prepared the report for submission to Dr. Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, I don't know how it'll be later, but Bangkok
                        and all of Thailand was known as sort of the Sin Capital of the world, and
                        it was a meeting place for everyone, and anybody who went in there sort of
                        got caught up in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: George Newman and Curtis thought it was a fine report. The recommendation
                    was that the U.S. Government should not take on major responsibility in the
                    counter-insurgency effort. Now this was in 1972, our country was torn over
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Kissinger did not welcome the report. He wanted a more active
                    series of policy recommendations. It was only later we learned he wished to send
                    a signal to the Chinese government that the U.S. was seriously considering
                    getting involved in Chang Mai, and that they would be well advised to reduce
                    their support for the insurgency. To Kissinger's consternation, my report
                    concluded that it was a Thai problem, it's not disastrous therefore, let them
                    handle it.</p>
                <p>I passed the report to the White House, and Kissinger asked — demanded —
                    according to his emissaries that the report be withdrawn. To his everlasting
                    credit, Curtis Tarr said, “Absolutely not. It's an honest report,” and he, Tarr,
                    would support its findings. Kissinger reportedly said, “I don't want this
                    report” and tried to return it. Dr. Kissinger was furious; he pigeonholed the
                    report, and the first thing he did, when he later arrived as Secretary of State,
                    Curtis Tarr was summarily dismissed. I had forewarning, and, as a result, I
                    managed to secure a one year sabbatical and retreat to the Brookings
                    Institution. Tom Stern helped me to secure my evacuation from a bureaucratic
                    kitchen that was enflamed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, '73. I went to work with Phil Farley in preparation of a book on arms
                    transfers. Do you know Phil?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Farley was a former head of PM and a recognized arms control policy
                    specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, we'll pick up on that point. This is the 13th of
                        January 1997. Bill, okay, you're in, what is it, arms transfer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, do you want to talk a bit about our Brookings experience?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, let's talk about the Brookings experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: My Brookings experience was in itself unique. Henry Owen, who was then the
                    Director of the Foreign Affairs Division, who had himself had extensive State
                    Department experience, approached a private foundation to finance a study
                    project on U.S. arms transfer policy. He and Phil Farley, who had left the
                    government, approached me and asked if I would join them to conduct the study
                    over a one-year period. I accepted the invitation. The book that emerged was
                    entitled, Arms Across the Sea, published by the Brookings Institution. It was a
                    critique of Administration policy in the arms transfer field, with several
                    recommendations for improving planning strategy and resource allocations. This
                    was a period during which Dr. Kissinger came to the State Department as
                    Secretary of State. I was expected to return to the Department sometime
                    thereafter and pursue my erstwhile activities in the arms transfer field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go to the Brookings study. First place, could
                        you describe at that time, during the early '70s, the atmosphere of the
                        Brookings Institute, as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Brookings was a dynamic institution. It afforded me an opportunity to gain
                    and broaden perspectives on policy issues and related problems. Brookings had a
                    number of divisions within it, inhabited by serious professionals from the
                    academic and the policy communities. Many were on leaves of absence, much as
                    myself, looking at such issues as the peacetime military, whether or not the
                    draft system, or selective service system, should be returned, or a professional
                    army maintained, which was then being introduced, and the degree to which the
                    turning toward a professional army would diminish support for military service
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>Another group was looking at the question of nuclear weapons strategy and
                    problems associated with implementing the SALT I agreement, following on with a
                    second agreement on SALT II.</p>
                <p>A third group we were closely with was concerned with the threat of Soviet
                    efforts to undermine conservative regimes or moderate governments in the Middle
                    East, Africa, and Latin America. This at a time when Dr. Kissinger had been
                    talking in general terms about a period of detente vis a vis Moscow itself, and
                    this was a contentious study by specialists at the Brookings Institution. While
                    the institution had enjoyed, if one might use the label of being a “liberal”
                    institution, the staff there was really a good representative mix of
                    conservatives and “liberals,” if anything, the Brookings Institution was
                    adopting a centrist position. I say this because this was at a period shortly
                    after President Nixon and his National Security Advisor had come to regard the
                    Brookings Institution as a haven of, how should I put it, anti-Administration
                    doves. This was a period too, you may recall, when there had been the break-in
                    at Brookings sponsored by the Administration; and there had also been the
                    Pentagon papers expose. So the atmosphere, at least in the Administration in
                    Washington, was one of unhappiness with the Brookings professionals. I found the
                    Brookings group I dealt with very professional, quite impartial in their
                    judgments — there was a slant in some of the assessment and evaluation — but
                    essentially a centrist in the foreign policy/national security areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about as you were doing the study on arms transfers?
                        It's a fancy way of saying arms sales, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, no, because the program had several dimensions. You had, for
                    example, the grant program; grant military assistance, which was assistance
                    provided with equipment, training, and the like, on a non-reimbursable basis.
                    You also had within the program, even though it was designated security
                    assistance, the economic component called Economic Supporting Assistance that
                    was administered by the Agency for International Development; and then, of
                    course, you had for a short period of time the Public Safety Program, which in
                    itself derived its inspiration from Alex Johnson, who was regarded as the
                    godfather of that program. So it had various components; it wasn't simply a
                    sales program. But the assessment that Phil Farley and I undertook was one in
                    which we tried to see what the rationale or justification was for the various
                    programs, and whether or not there were areas in which their coordination and
                    management could be improved significantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you had certain ideas before you went
                        into this, and was there any sort of change towards what you were doing
                        after you sort of looked at them with somebody else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, I approached the Brookings study somewhat pragmatically, having been
                    involved with the Presidential Task Force in '69, and having been involved with
                    the establishment of the Office of Under Secretary of State for Security
                    Assistance; and also having served within the Bureau of Political Military
                    Affairs establishing a planning and analysis staff. I came to Brookings with a
                    number of clear-cut ideas as to what might be done to improve or enhance the
                    program. Quite frankly, Phil Farley had a somewhat more reserved position as to
                    what really should be done, could be done, might be done with regard to the
                    program, so during our period of association, there was a considerable amount of
                    give and take from each side. I was pushing, if you will, the envelope much more
                    than Phil was prepared to accept during the early stages of our combined
                    effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you did your combined research, did you find, was there
                        a problem getting information from the government, or was it pretty much
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, there were a number of open sources, such as testimony before
                    Congressional committees by various State and DOD representatives.So there were
                    other open sources. In addition, we conducted a number of interviews with former
                    Chiefs of Mission and others who had been involved in recommending transfer of
                    military equipment to various countries. And then, of course, there were also
                    seminar-type meetings, in which we brought together a number of practitioners
                    and academics for lunches at Brookings to exchange views and to try out some of
                    the ideas that we planned to put in the book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the book came out, and this was a published book, so
                        what was the name of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LEWIS: The title of the book was Arms Across the Sea, which has a certain piquant
                    quality to it as a title; I didn't particularly like it — sounded like Ginger
                    Rogers and Fred Astaire to me — but that's the way it goes. I didn't have final
                    veto rights over the title of the book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was published when, in ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: In 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back when to the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, I was told when I departed for the year that my position as the
                    Director of the PM Planning Staff for Arms Transfers would be held open for me,
                    but in the intervening period, there was a need to place other Foreign Service
                    officers in some of these positions. By the time I returned, that position was
                    closed to me. The Office of Under Secretary of Security Assistance was then
                    under the direction of Carlyle E. Maw. Carlyle had been personal lawyer to
                    Secretary Kissinger in an earlier incarnation, then was Legal Counselor to the
                    Department shortly after the arrival of Mr. Kissinger as Secretary of State. I
                    was told that Mr. Maw was very heavily engaged, despite his shift of
                    responsibilities to Security Assistance, in dealing with legal matters, most
                    particularly, the Halperin suit against Kissinger that followed after Halperin
                    had had his civil rights violated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the wiretap case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: The wiretap case, yes. So Maw was discreetly involved in providing legal
                    advice to Kissinger. He was a distinguished lawyer in his own right, but had
                    very little background experience in arms transfers. I was invited to come on
                    board as his Special Assistant in, I believe, '74-'75. My responsibility was to
                    oversee the entire arms transfer program from the remote perch of the Under
                    Secretary. In this position, I worked very closely with Tom Stern, who was then
                    the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs. Tom and I had
                    known each other for several years, and had worked closely on policy issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: 1974 to 1975, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues in policy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LEWIS: A number of issues arose. For example, in '74 you had the invasion of East
                    Timor by the Indonesian military; the question arose as to whether or not we
                    should terminate, or at least suspend, all arms transfers to the government of
                    Indonesia, since this action was a clear violation of the United Nations
                    Charter. The initial position taken by the East Asia Bureau and myself was to
                    suspend the arms, but, in due course, Secretary Kissinger overrode us,
                    contending that Indonesia was of great strategic value to the United States, and
                    that while human rights concerns and related matters were important, the
                    security interests of the United States required us to continue to provide
                    military equipment and training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is just at about the time of the fall of South
                        Vietnam, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: This was also at the time of the fall of South Vietnam, and we were deeply
                    involved. Let me take a step back. With the signing of the agreement in Paris in
                    '73, just before I departed for the Brookings Institution, we had agreed with
                    the government of North Vietnam to terminate our arms supply to South Vietnam
                    within a specified period of time. The government of North Vietnam, for its
                    part, indicated it would not take advantage of the situation by increasing its
                    military presence in the South. We had a very finite deadline, and in that
                    finite deadline, there was an operation that was launched, we worked very
                    closely with our friends in the Pentagon. It was code worded “Enhanced Plus”.
                    This involved operating, within the agreed deadline, to provide the ARVN forces
                    with a substantial amount of upgraded equipment. For example, we decided that we
                    would provide them through our friends and allies, F-5 aircraft. F-5 aircraft
                    was not available in large numbers in our military inventory; so we prevailed
                    upon the governments of the Republic of Korea, Iran, and one or two others, to
                    make F-5 aircraft available to the government of South Vietnam within the
                    deadline. That was nibbling at the margins of the agreement, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel during this time about how Henry
                        Kissinger felt about this business, I mean outside of saying, “Don't mess
                        with Indonesians”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, the general impression one had was that Dr. Kissinger, even when he
                    was National Security Advisor, viewed arms transfers as an appropriate and
                    effective instrument of policy. Given his global view — that of a grand
                    strategist — he believed that certain selected countries should become the
                    beneficiaries of our arms transfers. Within his strategic framework, he also
                    believed that the United States couldn't always and everywhere assume a
                    stabilizing role in various regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf,
                    Asia, and South Asia. And, therefore, we should select, identify, if you will,
                    so-called middle powers, friends of ours in each region, that could play a
                    “policeman's” stabilizing role. A classic example of this was the Persian Gulf.
                    In '69, if I recall the date correctly, the British government announced that,
                    as a result of financial considerations, it could no longer provide the security
                    forces necessary to ensure a stable Gulf area. Actually, the entire region East
                    of Suez fell under the British retrenchment decision. In 1972, then-National
                    Security Advisor Kissinger, as a result of a series of studies called “National
                    Security Memoranda”, prepared a determination or decision memorandum for
                    signature by President Nixon that Iran would serve as an effective replacement
                    for the British in the Gulf area. And we were directed at that time to launch a
                    major arms transfer sales program, on the order of several billions of dollars,
                    to the government of Iran. The Shah, most curiously, at the same time, was in
                    large measure responsible for increasing the price of oil through the oil
                    cartel, all of which had an adverse impact on the U.S. economy. We were caught
                    in the paradoxical position of supporting a friend and ally in a policeman role,
                    while suffering double jeopardy in terms of arms transfers and, if you will, the
                    attack on our economy. A classic example of real politik in misdirected
                    action.</p>
                <p>Indonesia, as an emerging middle power, if I am not mistaken, could play a major
                    balancing role in the Southeast Asia area. That is why Kissinger insisted that
                    our arms program continue to be maintained in Indonesia after the East Timor
                    takeover. Then there was the classic example in Southern Africa, the so-called
                    “Tarr Baby Study”, which involved a National Security Memoranda study that
                    engaged the attention of Tony Lake at the time — who was on the White House
                    Staff. Dr. Kissinger was looking for an emerging middle power in sub-Saharan
                    Africa. The study concluded that most of the Black African nations would be
                    beset by insecurity and instability; there was only one area in which you would
                    have a very large stabilizing element; that would be the “White Redoubt” regions
                    of Southern Africa. The W.R. embraced South Africa, and if you will, Southern
                    Rhodesia, which had broken away from British colonial rule, Angola, and
                    Mozambique. This view, then, led the United States to adopt a hands-off posture
                    in independent Black Africa and low key support for White Redoubt regimes.
                    Events took a sudden turn in '75 to undermine that policy. But covertly, prior
                    to the debacles, we began to provide assistance through various agencies, to
                    South Africa and others.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LEWIS: It was known to our office, but this was at the direction of the White
                    House, and then-Secretary Kissinger, so obviously, this was established policy,
                    and one might enter a dissenting vote, but it would have no effect whatsoever.
                    As a matter of fact, there was general view — at least it was my impression —
                    that on the part of Dr. Kissinger and his immediate subordinates, that the
                    traditional Foreign Service and Civil Service bureaucracy were of uncertain
                    loyalty and not to be kept terribly informed as to what Kissinger's motivations

                    was encumbered, and I was appointed Special Assistant to Carlyle Maw, Office of
                    Under Secretary of Security Assistance. I devoted most of my time trying to sort
                    out policy differences between Bureaus, since Mr. Maw was deeply involved in the
                    Halperin case, and had little real interest in arms transfer.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Well, I had been in the African Affairs section of INR for a number of
                    years, I had also served in the Office of National Estimates, CIA, on assignment
                    to cover Africa and the Middle East; this was the 1960-62 period. I had also
                    served, you may recall, in '67 and '68 and part of '69 in the Policy Planning
                    Staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense covering African and Middle
                    Eastern affairs, so I had a fair amount of background.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: This would be from 1976 to 1978. Primary responsibility of the Regional
                    Affairs Office in the Bureau of African Affairs, at least as assigned to me by
                    Bill Schaufele, was to be responsible for bringing together various of the
                    several offices in the Bureau to establish a coherent overall strategy for arms
                    transfers and security assistance, to help develop planning for funding outyear
                    programs, as they were called, and to basically be involved in assistance
                    missions to countries in the African region. I directed and later was Deputy
                    Director of three missions in Africa involving arms transfers. One was to the
                    Sudan, where President Nimeiri, having thrown Russian advisors out, turned to
                    the United States to upgrade Sudanese military capabilities. There was also
                    Ethiopia, where we were involved for awhile in the removal of the U.S. from
                    Asmara station which had been opened in the late '40s by the U.S. military and
                    an examination of the type of facilities we should have as a result of our
                    withdrawal from Ethiopia. Another mission was to Kenya, where the government had
                    expressed growing concern about Somali incursions and the prospect of Somali
                    irredentism leading to the destabilization of the East African area. And
                    finally, I was also required to attend NATO expert meetings on Africa; they were
                    held twice a year in Brussels, to discuss security issues and looming problems
                    in the African region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there very definitely a division of Africa into the

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Geographically, there were two functional offices, the regional office,
                    concerned primarily with security issues, and related problems, plus providing
                    an overriding view of the region as a whole; the second functional office was
                    Economic Affairs. But in geographic terms the Bureau was divided into an Office
                    of West African Affairs, no distinction between Francophone and Anglophone;
                    Office of Central African Affairs, which was essentially Zaire and neighboring
                    territories; East Africa; and Southern Africa, Southern Africa embracing
                    primarily South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Rhodesia. The North African
                    region, which had been part of the African Bureau's area of responsibility, had
                    been hived off by Secretary Kissinger shortly after his arrival as Secretary. He
                    had decided that Turkey and Greece should fall within the purview of the Bureau
                    of European Affairs, and as a consolation prize, North Africa to the Bureau of
                    Near Eastern/South Asian Affairs. So the African Affairs Bureau was stripped of
                    linkages to the Mediterranean area, courtesy of Secretary of State
                    Kissinger.</p>

                        did we think of the Sudan as being important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: By 1975 and '76, Nimeiri had gotten rid of Russian advisors. The Sudan was
                    the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa geographically. It was regarded as
                    strategically placed vis a vis the Red Sea-Persian Gulf region, and therefore
                    was of considerable strategic value in terms of our interests. Secondly, we
                    became aware that Sudan's leader, Col. Nimeiri wished to be closely associated
                    with the United States. He would support our policies on Middle Eastern
                    questions, which was considered of potential value. Sudan was also regarded as
                    important because of the unstable situation that was beginning to emerge in
                    Ethiopia. In 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie, our friend of over three decades, was
                    toppled from power. He was replaced by a military committee in 1974 consisting
                    of 130 military men, officers of general rank, and colonels down to sergeants,
                    who tried to guide the country. I don't want to bore you with all the convoluted
                    details. But the ruling committee (Dergue) could not agree on policies to be
                    pursued in the post-Selassie period; there was a contest over power which was
                    resolved in the most democratic fashion possible — the committee members began
                    to draw their pistols and shoot each other! And a number of the generals, not
                    being particularly proficient in the use of arms, were carried out, and a
                    gentleman emerged, Mengistu, who we had trained in the United States. He was
                    known in Ethiopia, perhaps not affectionately, as “the Sharpshooter”. Colonel
                    Mengistu, by '74 and '75, was beginning to make clear that he was going to
                    reorient Ethiopian foreign policy away from the West in general, and the U.S. in
                    particular. In addition, by '75 he was unleashing the so-called Red Terror
                    campaign against Western-trained intellectuals and university students. Some of
                    the professors were actually lynched, hung on lampposts as warning signs for
                    other refractory elements. Some of us were rather disturbed by this; I felt at
                    the time that university professors might be expendable, but university students
                    should be safeguarded from this type of Red Terror campaign.</p>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Kagnew Station by the mid-'70s had lost its strategic military value. In
                    the '40s and '50s it was an important listening post, involving intercept
                    communications and the like, covering the Middle East and portions of Africa. It
                    was of great value to us, at the time. As a result, we supported Haile Selassie
                    when he incorporated Eritrea as part of the Ethiopian Empire, in violation of
                    the UN resolution that said Eritrea should remain an autonomous entity. But in
                    the course of the years, advanced technology reduced the importance of Asmara
                    Station. Secondly, Eritreans were rebelling against Ethiopian rule and the
                    situation was becoming increasingly unstable in Eritrea generally. We decided,
                    in due course, that we should close down Asmara station, particularly as the Red
                    Terror Campaign continued to mount. With the arrival of the Carter
                    Administration in 1977, President Carter determined that Ethiopia would no
                    longer be a major beneficiary of our U.S. arms transfers program. The Mengistu
                    regime retaliated by saying, “Well, then, you'd better get out of Kagnew
                    immediately”, and we withdrew with some alacrity in that period.</p>

                        Soviets at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, you may recall that when Somalia gained its independence in 1960, it
                    had five stars implanted in its national flag; the stars were symbolic of
                    Somalia's irredentist ambitions, that is, the integration of the Somali
                    populations in all of the Horn area. The first star, of course, being Somalia
                    itself; the second star being British Somaliland, which was peacefully
                    incorporated into Somalia shortly after its independence; the third star
                    represents the enclave of Djibouti, only half of whose population was Somali;
                    the fourth star represented the region of Ethiopia, which encompassed one-third
                    of Ethiopian territory; and the fifth star involved the northeastern portion of
                    Kenya. If the Somalis had succeeded, then obviously it would have led to the
                    unraveling of nation states throughout the Eastern portion of Africa.</p>
                <p>The Somalis began to cast around for an external supplier of arms to assist them
                    to create a national army. The Italians, the former trustee power, showed some
                    interest, but the government in Mogadishu turned to the Soviet Union; since the
                    U.S. was the principal arms supplier of arms to Ethiopia it made good sense in
                    Mogadishu to have another superpower serve as countervailing element. The
                    Russians became the principal supplier, and as quid pro quo they secured access
                    to a major naval base in the northern portion of the Somali republic.</p>
                <p>With the arrival of the Carter Administration, one of the tenets or planks of the
                    Carter Administration was, if you will, to reverse the Kissingerian approach —
                    no major arms transfers should occur without approval by the President. The U.S.
                    government would begin to reduce the level of U.S. arms transfers annually, and
                    there would be stricter oversight of the activities of corporations flogging
                    arms transfers. This seemed to signal growing withdrawal of the United States
                    from real politik policy as represented during the Nixon-Kissinger period.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Peculiarly enough, shortly after the arrival of the Carter Administration, the
                    President was approached by Anwar Sadat in the name of several Arab governments
                    from the Red Sea-Persian Gulf area saying, “We're very much concerned about the
                    growing Soviet presence in this area, and we would like to see the removal of
                    the Soviet presence. When can we anticipate U.S. support?” The President
                    reportedly gave a noncommittal reply, but didn't say no. The Sudan became the
                    first target; with the ejection of Soviet advisors, the Sudan should be
                    encouraged to turn to the U.S. for arms. We acquiesced. The decision was to say,
                    “Yes, we're prepared to do this,” as a result of the survey mission in which I
                    had been involved.</p>
                <p>With regard to Somalia, there was a meeting of the National Security Council, and
                    President Carter had invited a Time Magazine correspondent to the meeting. As
                    they were addressing the Red Sea-Persian Gulf area, somebody pointed out that
                    the Russians still had a naval base in the Hargeisa area. The President
                    apparently said, “Well, we've got to do everything possible to get rid of that
                    base.” And so, despite protestation that we were moving away from a real politik
                    position, in the case of Somalia, we clearly were adopting a contrary position.
                    This was reported in the Time Magazine, and people in Cairo, Riyadh, and Teheran
                    concluded, “Aha! We do have the President on our side!” Their governments began
                    to urge that the Somalis terminate their dependence on the Russians. At that
                    stage, a certain Russian official began to urge that the Somalis themselves not
                    undertake military action to get control over the Ethiopian Ogaden region, that
                    they behave themselves. This cautionary note was reinforced by the visit to the
                    area of Mr. Fidel Castro. The Bearded One urged the Ethiopians and Somalis to
                    resolve their differences peacefully. The Somalis were told that if they would
                    intervene with the Soviets supplied military equipment in the Ogaden, this
                    action would lead to a termination of Soviet military assistance to Mogadishu.
                    In May or early June of 1977, for some unexplained reason, the White House
                    National Security Council staff prevailed upon the President to agree to a shift
                    in American policy. The shift involved agreement that the U.S. would provide
                    arms to Mogadishu. As quid pro quo, the Russians would be asked to leave
                    Hargeisha. That is my personal appreciation of the demarche, but that signal
                    sent to Mogadishu then freed the Somalis to invade the Ogaden region.</p>
                <p>The point basically was that within a few weeks after that the Somalis did invade
                    the Ogaden, the Russians did terminate their military assistance program. The
                    Somalis then called in their pledge from Washington, but the White House
                    determined that the Somalis had been condemned by the OAU for the invasion of
                    the Ethiopia. Hence, we could not provide arms to the Somalis at that time. We
                    had argued previously that our arms were for defensive purposes, but what the
                    heck, rifles shoot in all directions, so the distinction was without merit.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The unraveling — should historians write, should study this misadventure — was
                    truly significant regionally. Precisely at the time that the Somalis were
                    requesting American weapons, the Saudis, the Iranians, and the Egyptians had
                    supplies available. The Egyptians were going to provide Soviet arms for the
                    Somalis, the Saudis and the Iranians were going to provide American arms, and as
                    their planes were prepared to take off, Washington suddenly sent a signal
                    saying, “No, we can't do this because of the OAU and the fact that the Somalis
                    are being characterized as aggressors in this matter.” So they backed off, there
                    was confusion all over the place as to what was Washington's intentions.</p>

                        had problems, they kept getting involved and then pulling back, as with the

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: It was all part and parcel of the same thing. But this helps, I believe,
                    explain in part the reason why the Shah of Iran, in the midst of his crisis a
                    little later, in 1978, was never quite sure what American policy was, because we
                    were emitting all sorts of signals in Washington at the time, all terribly
                    confusing. The Administration never got itself sorted out in that region.</p>

                        fascinating, and particularly at that period. What was your feeling at the

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: My feeling at the time was that we should stop pretending that we had a
                    hands-off policy, first of all. Secondly, that it was in our security interests
                    to make clear to the Somalis that we wanted to see Hargeisha evacuated by the
                    Soviets. If they could, good and well, we would supply American arms, but with
                    the proviso the Somalis were not to use American arms for the invasion of the
                    Ogaden. We never made that clear; our signals were ambiguous. By then it was
                    clear that Mengistu was somebody we couldn't work with. The problem we had in
                    trying to shape policy was that the then-Assistant Secretary of State to Africa
                    was much more interested in the Southern African problem.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, there was that. And remember, too, we had our special Ambassador to
                    the United Nations, Andrew Young. Andrew Young felt, quite properly, that the
                    tilt of the Nixon Administration, in particular Secretary Kissinger, had been in
                    favor of the White regimes in South Africa. This was unacceptable policy, and
                    that President Carter needed to reverse it.</p>
                <p>By the time the Carter Administration arrived in 1977, the U.S. was not held in
                    high esteem in Black Africa, because by then our unbalanced position had leaked
                    to the press. You may recall, as a matter of fact, in '76, Dr. Kissinger was
                    busily involved in trying to resolve problems relating to Angola and Rhodesia.
                    He tried to tour Africa, and was not received by a goodly number of African
                    chiefs of state; they held him in very low esteem. With the arrival of the
                    Carter Administration, Andrew Young and others, quite properly, said, “No, we
                    have to publicly set aside the Kissingerian policy.” This became priority number
                    one. But there were divisions within the Bureau, as to how to deal with other
                    regions such as the Horn of Africa. On the Horn, there was an inclination on the
                    part of Moose and others not to become deeply involved, eschewing real politik
                    approaches. As a result, the decision making responsibility migrated to the
                    White House staff. Here, once again, you had division of view in terms of how to
                    deal with the festering Horn problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, does that continue throughout the Carter
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: No, it didn't. You then had a series of events which led the
                    Administration to change its position. Now this involved linking, if you will,
                    the Horn region of North Africa with the Gulf area. By '78 and '79, you had, of
                    course, the overthrow of the Shah of Iran and the arrival of the Ayatollah
                    Khomeini. You also had the insertion in '78 of Soviet forces into Afghanistan,
                    and the fear in some Washington circles that the Russians, once they subjugated
                    the people of Afghanistan, would move on Iran, and thereby gain control of the
                    Persian Gulf region, traditionally viewed as one of the basic objectives of
                    Soviet national security policy. As a result, in January of 1978, President
                    Carter, during his State of the Union Address, declared that the Persian Gulf
                    was of the highest possible interest to the United States, and that we were
                    therefore going to create “an American rapid deployment force” to be inserted
                    into the Gulf in the event of an act of aggression by an unstated party.
                    Everybody understood this to be the Soviet Union. This represented a major
                    reversal of policy in terms of the Horn area and the Gulf. Why? Because we
                    didn't have a rapid deployment force. We started to create one, but if you had
                    such a force in the United States, where was it going to be based once deployed
                    overseas. How would they get there?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We started, after the State of the Union Address, a mad dash led by American
                    diplomats and Defense Department officials, to gain basing rights in the region.
                    We negotiated special access agreements with Egypt, which accorded us the right
                    to overfly or land at selected Egyptian airports and to use the Suez canal in
                    the event this rapid deployment force had to be moved into the Persian Gulf. We
                    negotiated the same with Sudan; we arranged for naval rights at Port Sudan. We
                    established compatible rights with Somalia, and with Kenya. We signaled Moscow
                    we were prepared to project American military forces into the region should
                    circumstances warrant. And what was the quid pro quo? We agreed in exchange for
                    these rights that the U.S. would make arms available for these countries
                    providing access rights. By the time you are at the final stages of the Carter
                    Administration, there has been a complete reversal of national security and arms
                    transfer policies.</p>

                        tribes...</hi>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: There are two things that are misleading here. First of all, there were
                    those who contended that we should support the Somalis in their desire to create
                    a unified nation state, since the Somalis constituted a clearly identifiable
                    ethnic community. Presumably they spoke one language, which they didn't — there
                    were a number of sub-dialects. And they appeared united by a common history and
                    culture. As we have seen, that was not the case, and should never have been
                    viewed as such, a terrible mistake on our part.</p>
                <p>But in terms of your question they were using American arms: and cast-off Russian
                    arms to pursue the irredentist goals. The main military contingent under General
                    Said used American arms. Some of the clans opposing the General were using old
                    Russian equipment. In addition, in this part of the world, as elsewhere, there
                    were plenty of private arms dealers prepared to cash in on local conflicts. So
                    it's a bit misleading to assume the Somalis were totally dependent on American
                    arms. They had access to a wide variety of weaponry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what was going on in Angola, Mozambique,
                        that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes. Let me offer a context. Remember that until 1975, the policy clearly
                    favored the Whites Redoubt regimes. In the case of Angola and Mozambique, both
                    were under Portuguese colonial control. With the death of Salazar in '75, the
                    situation began to unravel, from the perspective of Secretary Kissinger. In the
                    case of Mozambique, its transition to independence came relatively rapidly and
                    without too much internal upheaval. Frelimo, the leading liberation movement,
                    quickly took control, and was operating reasonably effectively at that time, and
                    was collaborating over economic issues with the Southern Rhodesian and South
                    African governments — although on an unofficial basis.</p>
                <p>The situation in Angola was entirely different. In the case of Angola, the
                    struggle against the Portuguese involved three parties. One was a party directed
                    by Holden Roberto — I always thought his name should be Robert Holden — of the
                    FLNA, a very minor group located in the northern portion of Angola, and enjoying
                    covert support from Mobutu and company in neighboring Zaire. The second
                    political group was the Unita movement under Savimbi, located in the central
                    portion of Angola and controlling the country's diamond mines. The third was a
                    group led by Agostino Neto, which had seized control of the capital city of
                    Luanda. Dr. Kissinger was apparently experiencing a Stenglerian phase at that
                    time. The government of South Vietnam had fallen, Turkey had invaded Cyprus, and
                    NATO was in disarray over the invasion. You had the emergence of a Socialist
                    regime in Spain, after the death of Francisco Franco, and the growing influence
                    of the Communist Party in Italy was of concern to the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Portugal, of course, was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: And Portugal, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, it was almost a write-off</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Almost a write-off. Kissinger also believed that the effort at detente
                    with Moscow was not working terribly well, and the U.S. post-Watergate was
                    increasingly on the defensive from a strategic viewpoint. He believed that
                    detente had been undermined by Soviet actions in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, he
                    apparently believed that the Russians were under an obligation to notify us as
                    to what Sadat's intentions were, and failed to do so. The Russians argued they
                    didn't know because Sadat had thrown out all Russian military advisers a year
                    previously.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In 1975, Kissinger believed that the U.S., being on the defensive, would be
                    challenged somewhere in the world by not specifically the Soviet Union, but by
                    Soviet surrogates, possibly in the form of liberation movements. The Secretary
                    determined that Angola was where the challenge would arise. He directed that the
                    U.S. undertake a covert action program against the Neto group, to throw them out
                    of Luanda. Working closely with the South African government and through our
                    CIA, a “flying column” of mercenaries was organized to enter Angola and to gain
                    control of the capital.</p>
                <p>At that time, you may recall, we had an Assistant Secretary of State for African
                    Affairs who objected and requested reassignment as a form of protest. He was
                    reassigned and Kissinger persisted in adventure. The flying column entered
                    Angola and were cutting through Neto forces, with the assistance of Savimbi and
                    his crowd. As they approached Luanda, Holden Roberto and Savimbi suggested it
                    would be more seemly to permit their forces to enter the capital. The mercenary
                    force stood down. We agreed, as did the government of Pretoria. In the
                    intervening period, the Russians injected thousands of Cuban troops and provided
                    military supplies. Lo and behold, the flying column was sent flying back to
                    neighboring Namibia.</p>
                <p>Kissinger then wanted to raise the ante, but by then our intervention had become
                    public knowledge, and Congress then passed the Clark resolution which enjoined
                    the U.S. further involvement, covert or non-covert, in Angola and Southern
                    Africa. Kissinger's effort failed rather badly. But, we continued, covertly to
                    provide arms to Savimbi, and kept the movement alive until the arrival of the
                    Reagan Administration, when the operation became a lynchpin of the Reagan
                    Doctrine — i.e., support for anti-Soviet insurgency operations.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Only indirectly. This was a covert action program. We bureaucrats in the
                    Bureau were excluded from any involvement.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: The period at the onset of the Carter Administration was an interesting
                    one. Carter and his people in the White House and in State, believed generally
                    that human rights considerations should be an overriding concern in foreign
                    policy — that the U.S. should no longer be the world's leading arms supplier. In
                    short, the Administration wished to move away from real politik, towards ideal
                    politik, emphasizing human rights and support for democracy. Consonant with
                    this, then, the President issued a directive, PD-13, in May 1977, that declared
                    the U.S. should not, among other things...</p>

                <p>LEWIS: '77, yes; U.S. embassies and consulates should not provide assistance to
                    American firms marketing military products in the Third World. The PD also
                    announced the President intended to personally review major arms supply sales to
                    countries in the Third World. Various other limitations and restraints were
                    directed, and remained in effect until the overthrow of the Shah.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, try to capture how things were
                        run, of Dick Moose as head of the AF.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Moose had been a junior Foreign Service officer who early in his career
                    decided that he did not wish to continue in the Foreign Service. Being from
                    Arkansas, he was invited to join the staff of Senator Fulbright. Moose was
                    deeply involved criticizing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam conflict, convinced
                    that the U.S. was on the wrong track in Vietnam. During the Ford Administration,
                    he endorsed the view that we should shift priorities in the foreign policy area
                    away from the use of military force and emphasize human rights concerns, as well
                    as support democratization efforts in the Third World. When he returned to the
                    State Department in '77, Moose was appointed Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration. But after several months something went awry. At that time, as
                    the Director for African Regional Affairs, I was responsible for setting up a
                    Chiefs of Mission conference; it was held in Abidjan in the Spring of '77. The
                    purpose was to discuss new strategies that might be adopted in Africa. Andrew
                    Young was the principal driver in terms of policy content. Moose indicated to me
                    that he would like to attend the conference. He was invited, and did so as
                    Deputy Under Secretary of State for Administration. He and Andrew Young
                    apparently hit it off personally. They agreed on a policy approach that would be
                    accorded high priority to Southern Africa and the White Redoubt problem. As a
                    result, Andrew Young supported Moose's moving down from the number five to the
                    number 12 position at the State Department, i.e., Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs.</p>
                <p>Moose clearly mistrusted his inherited Foreign Service bureaucracy. He apparently
                    believed that a number of us were unreconstructed, unrehabilitated real politik,
                    and that he should look elsewhere for loyalty and support for policy approaches.
                    This became manifest with tensions that developed with several office directors,
                    whose careers suffered badly as a result. In one case, one deputy office
                    director was in such disagreement with Moose's approach that he requested he be
                    relieved of his responsibilities and transferred elsewhere. So it was a Bureau
                    that had difficulty in the initial period adjusting to shifts in policy, as well
                    as adjusting to Moose's idiosyncratic way of running the Bureau itself.</p>

                        problem with the Carter administration, and of course, the irony is he came
                        back under the Clinton Administration again as the head of the
                        Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: His credentials were not impeccable as far as Administration was
                    concerned, and it showed up in the way in which he handled Senior Foreign
                    Service officers in the Bureau, as well as his handling of officers returning
                    from field assignments. He tended, on the whole, to be quite suspicious of
                    anybody who had served in Kissinger's State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, when you were looking at regional affairs,
                        that there were certain areas that you say, like Chad and elsewhere, this is
                        French, and let's just stay out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: In the period prior to the arrival of the Carter Administration, I think
                    there was a greater degree of mutual understanding between ourselves and the
                    French with respect to Africa and African problems. Kissinger himself, I think,
                    developed a very close relationship with the French Foreign Minister and others
                    in the French government. There was not as much disparity of view and friction
                    as we see today, under the Chirac government.</p>
                <p>In the Carter period, the emphasis on human rights and condemnation of
                    governments Francophone or Anglophone, for abuses, proved an irritant to the
                    government in Paris. The British had a different view; they didn't feel that
                    their interests were threatened by this; they did feel the need to engage in
                    polemics with Washington, because on the whole, London believed the special
                    trans-Atlantic relationship was holding. On the other hand, some British
                    corporations, and officials in defense, expressed concern with Carter Phase II
                    foreign policy, in which we began seeking access to military facilities in
                    Africa and offering arms in exchange. I remember such an occasion with regard to
                    Kenya. I was the Deputy Chief of a military survey mission that was assigned to
                    Kenya; the Head of Mission was a two-star general, a very, very fine officer. He
                    and I got along exceedingly well. We both wished to avoid excessive exuberance
                    in providing military equipment to Kenya. We did make a recommendation to the
                    White House that was subsequently approved — i.e., the U.S. should sell a
                    squadron of helicopters to the Kenyan government to enhance their long-range
                    reconnaissance capabilities in the northeast area. This was intended to ensure
                    some degree of control over refractory Somali clans. I was invited to London to
                    meet with people in the Ministry of Defence. They made it clear that as far as
                    Defence were concerned, and made it very clear that as far as they were
                    concerned, Kenya was their preserve, and that they would oppose in every way
                    possible the sale of American military equipment to the Kenyan military.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Moreover, they expressed unhappiness that General Hill, leader of our mission,
                    had indicated to the Kenyan Minister of Defense that corruption was rampant in
                    the Kenyan military, and that was one reason why the U.S. government proposed to
                    approach our special ties with a great deal of caution. Hill urged the Minister
                    of Defense to have his generals clean up their act. Well, not surprisingly, it
                    was reported to London, and during my discussions with British Defence officials
                    who noted; “You realize that this impetuous general of yours has to cast
                    suspicion on the integrity of the Kenyan military establishment, but indirectly
                    he is pointing an accusatory finger at us. He is suggesting we're turning a
                    blind eye on corruption within the Kenyan military; we resent this very deeply.”
                    It was an attack on our mission, which I tried to shrug off. It also reflected a
                    British sensitivity with respect to the arms market and the appearance of
                    American competition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything during this Carter period, any
                        dealings with Patt Derian, Assistant Secretary for Human Rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, we did. Derian arrived in an inhospitable atmosphere which reinforced
                    her view, that there had been too much of Kissingerian nonsense, to put it
                    politely. Patt was intent on ending this. Assistant Secretary Patt Derian made
                    clear that the human rights performance of other governments would be closely
                    scrutinized. Patt made it a point to bring in newly-minted American ambassadors
                    before they departed for field assignments, to wave a finger under their noses,
                    and say rather directly: “Well, ambassador, I want you to know I'm going to be
                    watching your performance in terms of human rights, and if I get any indication
                    that you're not performing up to the standard demanded by the White House,
                    you're going to be recalled immediately for reassignment.” In other words, Patt
                    proposed to be the Inspector General for human rights matters. Her approach had
                    the desired effect in some quarters.</p>
                <p>But Derian sometimes went off the reservation a bit. I remember when I was in
                    Khartoum involved in a military survey mission, that Patt had been apprised of a
                    terrible — and it was terrible — problem of female circumcision, a tribal rite
                    in Sudan. Patt had a message sent out to Khartoum demanding our ambassador
                    approach President Nimeiri and insist that this practice be terminated post
                    haste. The ambassador reported back that he had admonished the President of
                    Sudan on this matter, not that the President could do a thing about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Nimeiri?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, this was Nimeiri. The ambassador, an old friend of mine, reported
                    back that he had admonished the President on this matter, and the President
                    would take appropriate action. In actual fact, he hadn't said a word to the
                    President. The intervention would have been viewed as blatant intervention in
                    Sudan's affairs. Nevertheless, Patt did have an impact elsewhere. Remember that
                    Patt, very much an activist, was involved in the early phases on the unfolding
                    Iran crisis. It was Patt and her Bureau that held up the sale of police
                    equipment to Teheran in '77, the contention being that the Shah had adopted
                    authoritarian measures and that gross human rights abuses were becoming
                    apparent. Therefore, the U.S. should not provide crowd control devices. Well,
                    the Shah became aware of this and was very much distressed, particularly after
                    the episode involving the Somalis. But to his surprise, adding to the confusion
                    over American policy, you may recall that President Carter arrived in Teheran
                    around Christmas time of 1977 and toasted the Shah for the very liberal leader
                    he was. By that time, we were flogging something like $50-60 million in military
                    equipment to the Iranians, and we had 40,000 Americans there. But this is added
                    to the Shah's confusion. Here you have one part of the Department sending out
                    critical epistles saying you can't do this, and then the President arrived
                    saying, you're a fine old fellow.</p>
                <p>Another facet was the requirement to produce country-by-country human rights
                    reports and evaluations. That became another contentious issue — i.e., whether
                    various office directors in the African Affairs Bureau, as well as elsewhere,
                    were providing the toughest-minded, most hard-headed evaluations of human rights
                    situations. Before annual reports were issued, a tremendous amount of time was
                    devoted to “negotiations” in which perceptions clashed repeatedly.</p>
                <p>Remember that this first arose during the Kissinger period, as Secretary of
                    State. Congress had indicated in legislation that human rights reports should be
                    prepared each year; initially, Kissinger was unalterably opposed. He believed
                    that from a diplomatic point of view could undermine relationships; but he did
                    not publicly declare opposition, as I recall. He encouraged delaying tactics on
                    the part of State Department people, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of influence while you were there
                        on Andrew Young and our African policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Andrew Young was, for all intents and purposes, the principal architect of
                    our African policy, establishing the basic frame of reference and goals for
                    policy. Recall that at the time of the arrival of the Carter Administration, the
                    U.S. government in general, and State Department in particular, were held in
                    very low esteem by most Black African leaders. By 1976 they were aware that our
                    policy was to ignore them and to concentrate on White Redoubt Southern Africa.
                    When Young arrived at the UN, he found that we needed to establish the
                    credibility that we were adopting a different approach to Africa's problems.
                    Early on, he made an extensive swing through sub-Saharan Africa, meeting with
                    Chiefs of State and convincing many of them regarding U.S. intentions, although
                    some remained agnostic. The highest priority would be Southern Africa, he
                    pledged, and the U.S. would do everything in its power to work with the British
                    in the case of Southern Rhodesia to end the White regime there. It would also
                    end any special ties, military, para-military, covert in nature, with White
                    ruled South Africa; indeed, we would exercise pressure on the South African
                    government to withdraw from Namibia and to withdraw its support for Savimbi in
                    Angola. That was the first priority.</p>
                <p>The second priority was to assist Black African governments. We would feel free
                    to criticize them where there were gross and consistent human rights violations,
                    we would, as we began to draw down the levels of arms transfer programs in
                    Africa, try to replace these programs with significant increases in economic
                    aid. Peace Corps involvement would increase as well. We proposed to move towards
                    a confrontational posture with the White regimes, and seek to end the UN role in
                    Namibia. We would also try to enhance economic prospects in the other areas of
                    Africa.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Not on a daily basis, but my impression was that any significant
                    initiative that might be taken by Moose and company would be checked out first
                    with Andrew Young, and if not Andrew Young, then Andrew Young's deputy at the
                    United Nations, R. Aggrey. And so that became the preferred channel on that
                    side.</p>
                <p>My impression was, and remains, that essentially, with the exception of Northeast
                    Africa, the White House generally deferred to Andrew Young, his deputy, and Dick
                    Moose with regard to the remainder of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

                        the Congo and elsewhere. What was the feeling within the Bureau during this
                        time you were there, the '75-'80 period, of the Soviet threat?</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LEWIS: During the '75 period, when Dr. Kissinger was orchestrating strategy, it
                    became an overriding concern in terms of the Secretary's perspective,
                    particularly Soviet support for African liberation movements. The Secretary
                    remained, in '73 and '74, wedded to the strategic notion that the U.S. should
                    treat most of Black Africa with — in the term of the day — benign neglect, and
                    that the U.S. priority was to ensure that the White Redoubt area of Africa
                    should be secure from Soviet influence. Consonant with that view, the approach
                    he took was to support Mobutu in Zaire. Mobutu was our creature, we created him
                    in 1965. He was the recipient of a substantial amount of American assistance,
                    official and covert. Mobutu was a channel for the provision of assistance to the
                    Unita movement and to Holden Roberto, to ensure that Angola did not become a
                    Soviet satellite.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Mozambique, we turned a blind eye and did not denounce the
                    creation of a counter-Frelimo liberation movement, which was supported by
                    Southern Rhodesian Whites, and by the Government of South Africa.</p>
                <p>In the case of South Africa, we clearly exchanged intelligence information, and
                    estimates on the Soviet “threat” in Southern Africa. That was an abiding
                    concern, but it was consonant with the findings of National Security Study
                    Memorandum #39, in the context of world-wide competition with Moscow.</p>
                <p>Now, this represented a paradox, in the sense that here we were entering a
                    period, Kissinger thought, of detente with Moscow in the early '70s. He
                    attempted to massage Moscow; yet, we wanted middle regional power closely
                    aligned with us on security issues. You had a certain hedge here, reflecting
                    incompatibilities of policy and strategy vis a vis Moscow. Detente, but we don't
                    want Moscow to gain control over sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: There was not the true global strategic overview that Kissinger had
                    fashioned. On the other hand, Bill Schaufele, as Assistant Secretary, was very
                    cognizant of Kissinger's preferences and did attempt as best he could to keep a
                    balance in terms of realistic approaches. But Kissinger was the overriding force
                    as far as the policy on the continent was concerned.</p>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>LEWIS: I tend to view the Carter Administration as Carter Phase I and Carter
                    Phase II. Carter Phase I was the one in which there was a benign view of the
                    world at large in which the President expressed a desire to shift away from real
                    politik policies — to de-emphasize military force, military power, alliances,
                    arms transfers and to favor instead democracy and human rights concerns. That
                    approach held up until the end of 1978 and early '79.</p>
                <p>When you enter Carter Phase II, you have the Carter Doctrine relating to the
                    Persian Gulf, and the search for bases, and the use of arms transfer — this
                    represented a complete reversal of position. You may recall that at that stage,
                    the onset of Phase II, Carter said, I think, with political embarrassment, “Now
                    I understand what the Russians are up to.”</p>

                <p>LEWIS: The hostage takeover and the perceived shift of the power pendulum in
                    favor of Iran in the Gulf area. This produced a U.S. emphasis on the Horn region
                    as a zone in which we would contest Soviet influence. This was the situation in
                    which you have the arrival of the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Doctrine is
                    announced, and part of the Reagan Doctrine emphasized that we would create our
                    own liberation movements — e.g., the Contras in Central America — and these
                    liberation movements would seek to overthrow Communist regimes.</p>
                <p>One of the areas that we contested was Ethiopia, and we began covertly to provide
                    assistance to the Eritrean liberation movement and others, to get rid of the
                    sharpshooter, the infamous Colonel Mengistu, who had now turned full bore to
                    Moscow to prop up his regime and who was seeking to transform Ethiopian society
                    along essentially Marxist lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the time you were in the African Bureau, it's
                        been sort of a tenet of faith regarding African policy that the boundaries
                        of these states may be lousy, but any changing of the boundaries of the
                        states would be even lousier. How did you all feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LEWIS: There was full acknowledgement that the OAU Charter stipulated that the
                    boundaries inherited from the Colonial period should be respected, that there
                    could only be changes as a result of peaceful negotiation, not under duress.
                    Therefore, there was recognition in the Carter White House that the Somalis,
                    when they invaded the region, this could not be supported. The OAU would not
                    sanction or approve the invasion of Ogaden in any way. There have been many
                    boundary disputes, and military force has been used outside the Horn region. You
                    may recall the war between Tanzania and Uganda, when Idi Amin tried to seize
                    control of territory; finally Tanzanian forces and Ugandan threw out Idi
                    Amin.</p>
                <p>In terms of boundaries, they are meaningless with respect to the ability in many
                    countries to monitor them — there is recognition they have no ability to patrol
                    or maintain control over their boundaries. They are frontiers, zones of
                    geographic expression, and indeed, as time went by, after many of these
                    countries became independent, the fiat of government didn't extend throughout
                    the country; the span of government control was circumscribed.</p>
                <p>Boundary disputes erupted elsewhere. For example, the Libyan invasion of Chad and
                    the Aouzou Strip involved multiple boundary questions. The OAU tried to deal
                    with them by sending out wise men, which didn't work terribly well.</p>
                <p>There was the Moroccan claim, historically grounded, to territory in Mauritania
                    and Mali. Shortly after Morocco gained its independence in 1956, the then George
                    Washington of Moroccan independence, Mohammed V, issued a public statement
                    saying that the boundaries of Morocco should be extended to include all the
                    historic frontiers of tribes that one time or another owed loyalty to the
                    Moroccan monarchy. This led to a brief but punishing border war in 1963 with
                    Algeria, and of course, it opened up after Francisco Franco's death the question
                    of Western Sahara. Most of the African OAU member states recognized the SADR,
                    the government in exile, not Morocco's control. Morocco also had to reconsider
                    its claims to northern Mauritania and northern Mali. But these things still
                    obtain, and could lead to future conflict.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, again, the time you were there, what about the role
                        of Libya and its influence south, into the area that AF was concerned
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: In the case of Libya, its boundary was reasonably well determined by
                    cartographers at the time of its independence in 1950-1951. Libya was viewed by
                    many as a geographic expression, one presided over by the monarch Idris I, an
                    elderly gentleman without male issue, as they put it in England. But we financed
                    Libya so that we could have access to a base called Wheelus Field outside
                    Tripoli.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In September '69, Idris was overthrown while on vacation in Turkey, and control
                    of Libya then fell to a young military officer named Muammar Qadhafi, a man of
                    limited background and foreign affairs experience. In due course, Qadhafi tried
                    to unite Libya with the other Arab nations; he's a firm believer in Arab unity.
                    He had been influenced heavily by Nasser when Qadhafi was a young student. But
                    each of his efforts to form a federation with Arab neighbors fell apart. Sadat
                    couldn't stand his primitive views; he couldn't get along with Syria; an effort
                    at federation with Tunisia lasted 72 hours, when Bourguiba, the then-President
                    of Tunisia, heard about it — he hadn't been consulted by his Foreign Minister;
                    he terminated it quickly and sacked the Foreign Minister from office.</p>
                <p>As a result of rising frustration, Qadhafi was looking elsewhere for targets for
                    federation, and Chad looked like a promising area. There was disagreement over
                    the Aouzou Strip, and on top of this, people in Northern Chad — nomadic and
                    semi-nomadic — were Muslim. But they did not control Chad politically. The top
                    echelons were controlled by a Black African population called the Saras, a
                    tribal group. The Saras had benefited most directly from French rule and
                    therefore controlled the senior echelons of government.</p>
                <p>The problem was the people in Northern Chad were dissatisfied under the Sara
                    domination. The Sara were not Muslim, they were not of the same culture and
                    background. Insurgency erupted with regularity in Chad. Qadhafi, increasingly
                    frustrated by an inability to enter into a long-lasting federation with Arab
                    countries, decided to extend Libya's frontier southward. Libya was to have an
                    empire-building mission in not just Chad, but all of the Saharan Desert regions.
                    According to the best reports we had, the Libyans intended to create a central
                    African republic, united with Libya. Chad would be the starting point, to later
                    include portions of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, and ultimately even southern
                    Algeria. I mean, this man appeared a megalomaniac.</p>
                <p>Qadhafi sent covert assistance to the tribes of northern Chad, and in due course,
                    even sent some Libyan forces into the conflict. The OAU intervened, failed to
                    negotiate resolution of the problem, and it fell to the Reagan Administration to
                    deal with the problem.</p>
                <p>As Libyan forces went into Chad, Khartoum expressed its concerns and asked
                    Washington to signal Qadhafi we could not accept the intervention of Libyan
                    forces in northern Chad, thus threatening Sudan. We deployed a mighty force — I
                    think it was six or seven F-15's, unarmed — to Khartoum, whereupon Qadhafi said,
                    “What, they're unarmed, the Americans aren't terribly serious.” The firmer came
                    later when the Reagan Administration decided that Qadhafi would be Public Enemy
                    Number One in Africa, and that we had to thwart his ambition.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Yes. Briefly, the point is that in due course, the French were prepared,
                    at the urging from Washington, to intervene with military forces and curtail the
                    activities of Mr. Qadhafi south of a certain parallel in Chad. But while we were
                    involved in the Bureau, under the Carter Administration, we didn't really deal
                    directly with Chad in any meaningful way. We relied on OAU “wise men” to
                    intervene and try to solve the problem.</p>

                <p>LEWIS: Nigeria was a matter of growing concern, because there we faced the
                    problem of the seizure of political power by the military. Democracy and human
                    rights, you may recall, was the leitmotif of the Carter Administration which
                    hoped the military would return power to civilian authority — that Nigeria would
                    return to the path of Democracy. That hope failed, failed very badly. I think
                    Andrew Young and others were deeply disappointed on that score, because it
                    raised doubts in some circles that we had to bring representative democracy to
                    Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and to South Africa. So in a sense, Nigeria undercut
                    that argument.</p>

                    sanctuary in Saudi Arabia. He professed himself to be a Muslim. An interesting
                    case, Idi Amin. He also, like our friend Bokassa in the Central African Empire,
                    was a sergeant who rose through the ranks and in due course seized power. In the
                    case of Idi Amin, he had received paratroop training by the Israelis, and
                    proudly showed his paratroop patch, yet he was a Muslim. And when we had that
                    '76 crisis in which an Israeli plane was seized and landed at Entebbe Idi Amin
                    played host to a number of Israeli citizens.</p>

                    of overflight by Israeli military aircraft. I believe we quietly, even though we
                    were not on good terms with Mengistu, made clear to some people that we hoped
                    they would not interfere. The Ethiopians acquiesced to overflight. I don't think
                    the Sudan was directly involved; it was primarily Ethiopia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Let me think. The other area, of course, that was very contentious, was
                    Zaire, but we prevailed upon — Congress despite a great deal of grumbling — to
                    continue to provide significant amounts of aid. Our military aid did not produce
                    a very significantly improved performance on the part of the Zaire's
                    military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your, maybe some of the other people in the
                        African Bureau, feeling toward Zaire and Mobutu at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Well, during the Kissinger period, clearly the Zaire account, as they put
                    it, was under the control of the Secretary, a few of his advisers, and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency. The principal support channel was outside of the
                    hands of the State Department. We did have an Ambassador named Bob Oakley, who
                    tried to ameliorate the situation. He was severely chastised by Mobutu who, I
                    think, attempted to have him removed. Did Washington pull Oakley?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember. Well, you left the African Bureau in
                        what, 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Yes, '79-'80, and went to George Washington University and enjoyed my
                    period there, and in doing so, established a graduate program in security policy
                    studies, which remains to this day the largest professional program in the
                    School of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find when you moved to the academic side that
                        there was still a tie to the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: What do you mean by “tie”?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in other words, were you ever called upon to help
                        look at things and that, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LEWIS: Oh, yes, I was invited to participate in some State Department meetings
                    dealing with primarily Northern Africa, but also West African problems involving
                    boundary disputes. Another matter of very real concern at that time was the
                    growing spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa and the political/military
                    implications. I was also invited by members of Congress to write a special
                    report on the Horn area and the post-Carter policies that might be adopted.</p>
                <p>In recent years, I've been associated with the Department of Defense's National
                    Defense University, and with the Institute for National Strategic Studies, which
                    is not an academic institute; it actually does perform special and useful
                    services for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, some of the unified commanders such as CENTCOM. These are policy analyses
                    and contingency studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back to the time you were in the AF Bureau:
                        I'm in the process of interviewing Stephen Solarz, of Congress; he at one
                        point had the committee for Africa. Did he come into our purview at all
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: Only in the latter stages. During much of the period that I was there, it
                    was Congressman Diggs who was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa. The
                    relationship with the Department was frequently contentious, because Diggs
                    believed that the Kissinger approach, with the benign neglect and all the rest,
                    was racist, or reflected denial of traditional American values. And so, he
                    tended to be very skeptical about policies in Africa during his stewardship of
                    that particular committee.</p>
                <p>Solarz came somewhat after that, and I had to deal with Solarz for a bit of time.
                    He was somewhat more even-handed, but he, too, was skeptical on policy issues.
                    Solarz was a very much more constructive and activist type of chairman during
                    his period, and I thought he did a very, very good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bill, why don't we stop at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEWIS: I agree.</p>
