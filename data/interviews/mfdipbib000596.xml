                <p>Interviewed by: Hans Tuch </p>

                <p>Introduction</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Hans Tuch interviewing Henry J. Kellermann on
                        January 30, 1989 at his home in Bethesda, Maryland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Henry Kellermann was born in Germany in Berlin, in 1910; attended school at the
                    University of Heidelberg at Freiburg, and also, in this country, Johns Hopkins
                    University from 1937 to 1938, as well as Columbia University in New York in
                    1942.</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: And Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Berlin, yes. Of course. That goes without saying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Kellermann, Henry Kellermann, spent 25 years with the Department of State
                    both in Washington and as a foreign service officer abroad.</p>
                <p>What makes him and what he has to tell us particularly interesting in the context
                    of public diplomacy is because I believe he was one of the originators in the
                    post-World War II era of what we now call public diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In my view, the whole post-war public diplomacy field — and it really wasn't
                    called that until quite recently — emanated from two different sources.</p>
                <p>One of them was the Cold War when, after President Truman's speech on his
                    campaign of truth in 1950, we from then on, primarily, initially through the
                    Voice of America, tried to have a world-wide public affairs program which would
                    oppose the aggression of the Soviet Union and the aggression of communist
                    ideology.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The other source, in my view, comes from our efforts after World War II in Japan,
                    Germany and Austria to try to reeducate, reorient, the populations of those
                    defeated nations in order to redemocratize or bring back democracy, or bring
                    democracy to these countries.</p>
                <p>In that effort we, for the first time, really got involved in cultural-education
                    exchanges and relationships in order to promote an intellectual exchange between
                    our two countries, which was then translated into the other countries of Europe
                    which needed such intellectual input, together with their economic redevelopment
                    in that period of time.</p>
                <p>You, Henry, were particularly instrumental in that period, from, say, 1945, '46
                    to the early '50s in this whole reeducation and reorientation effort. As a
                    matter of fact, you published a book in 1977, I believe. Is that right?</p>
                <p>Entrance Into Public Diplomacy Work</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, which is called Cultural Relations: Instrument of
                        Foreign Policy, U.S.-German Exchanges, 1945 to 1954. If you don't mind, I
                        would like to focus on that particular period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So the first question is: How did you get into this at all? How did you get
                    involved in this?</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, let me think back for a minute. After all, it's more than 40
                    years ago. While certain things are very vivid in my mind; others have faded a
                    little into the background.</p>
                <p>What happened was that after the termination of hostilities in 1945, you had a
                    period in which the American government, together with the British, the French,
                    and initially with the Russians, was, in a way, the quasi-government of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>It performed functions which are normally the responsibility of any normal
                    government. We were responsible for politics, for economics, legal affairs,
                    administration affairs, and foreign policy all of which in the beginning were
                    not very well defined, but which in the course of the following years became a
                    well-planned, thoroughly organized program in which the United States inserted
                    much of its prestige, manpower, and financial resources.</p>
                <p>What you call “public diplomacy” didn't start as an integral part of military
                    government. It was only after the State Department took over that certain
                    functions were welded into the so-called public affairs program. It consisted of
                    different, but related activities, cultural and educational programs on one side
                    and public information on the other.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I was sitting in the Department of state in those days, at the long-arm of this
                    policy. All the operations in Germany were supervised and directed by the
                    Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to forty-nine ('49).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes, until State took over. The colonels under General Clay ran the
                    program.</p>
                <p>Now we found out very early in the game that while economics and politics figured
                    very prominently in Clay's program, education and information were a stepchild
                    of his operation. In fact, General Clay, who was a true believer in his own
                    priorities, felt that he could not teach democracy on empty stomachs.</p>
                <p>So for this reason, everything that had to do with food and the most important
                    necessities of daily life came first; education and information took a backseat.
                    When one day a group of German journalists appeared in my office in the State
                    Department, they reminded me that we had promised them a democratic press.</p>
                <p>I said, “We did, indeed.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Well, we are dead before we even get started.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: That was, I believe, '46 or '47. I asked: “How come?”</p>
                <p>They said, “We have no paper. There's no newsprint for newspapers, nor paper for
                    textbooks. The general doesn't believe in spending money on what he seems to
                    consider at this point to have a lower priority.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I tell you what I would do if I were you. You have been invited to
                    attend a conference of publishers and press people in Texas beginning tomorrow.
                    You go there and you tell them just exactly what you told me, namely that the
                    press is a stillborn child of the occupation.”</p>
                <p>They did, and what I expected happened. The following morning the front pages
                    carried headlines: “German press being starved out of existence.”</p>
                <p>General Clay, had a great deal of respect for public opinion and the press. In
                    less than a week the paper was shipped in from Sweden and other places. That was
                    the first time we put a foot down.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Origin of Licensing System For German Newspapers</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, at that time is when the newspapers were
                        licensed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: They were licensed. Incidentally, the licensing system was a scheme I
                    had worked out when I was still with OSS preparing the occupation. I wrote a
                    guide book for Military Government which proposed the licensing system, which
                    had its good effects and some bad effects as well. The British must have adopted
                    the same system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. It was adopted all over Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Reformation of The German Educational System</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Now you mentioned the word reeducation. I really never quite like it.
                    It has a certain flavor of arrogance and, at the same time, naivete. It
                    suggested that we were trying to make Germans all over again, from scratch. This
                    is not what we had in mind.</p>
                <p>Neither did General Clay, I have to say in his defense. What Clay had in mind,
                    and what we supported, was a change of the educational system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: ...that is to say, of the institutions, and particularly of the
                    nefarious so-called two-track system, which separated the poor kids from the
                    rich, which enabled a privileged minority to go to high school and to the
                    university. The rest of them stopped being educated at the age of 14 or so.</p>
                <p>We thought this was a low down, highly undemocratic feature of the prevailing
                    system. We came out in favor of free text books and free tuition and equal
                    educational opportunity for all.</p>
                <p>Now those were all unheard of things in Germany, and there was, of course,
                    resistance. Many didn't like us out-landers who would come in with newfangled
                    ideas and try to revamp a system that they felt was second to none, that had had
                    a rich tradition with well-known standards of excellence and had to be defended
                    against any kind of interference from the outside.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Well, as I said, General Clay had his problems. In certain parts of Germany
                    reforms did succeed. Berlin was one notable example. Bremen at least for a
                    while, was, and Hesse. But in Bavaria we had to face Alois Hundhammer, Minister
                    of Education, who had been a strong and devout anti-Nazi, but who was also one
                    of the most reactionary traditionalists. He even insisted on the ritual of
                    corporal punishment.</p>
                <p>I met him, a very well-groomed, almost elegant man with an Andreas Hofer beard.
                    His excuse for reintroducing corporal punishment (”Pruegelstrafe”), was:
                    “Bavarian boys wear leather pants. They can take it.”</p>
                <p>Coming back to General Clay's school reform efforts, it has always been
                    questionable whether such esoteric things as education and culture can be taught
                    by military force. The military operate by fiat, by order. This is —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a second. I'm going to change the batteries on this
                        because I think maybe they're getting a little weak. Just a moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Continue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Beyond this, there seems to be a self-contradiction in trying to
                    teach democracy by military command. Now when the State Department took over in
                    '49, we had to give up most of the controls which permitted us —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's “we”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: All western allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Previously, under military government we were able to enforce our
                    policy in political and economic areas and in education and information as well.
                    In 1949 we proposed to let go of our controls in the latter two areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The French didn't like our abandonment of controls. They considered it premature.
                    I remember I was at the time in Paris attending the conference of foreign
                    ministers. I was called in the inner sanctum of Mr. Sauvagnargues, who later
                    became ambassador to Bonn, and also foreign minister.</p>
                <p>He kept saying, “What is your hurry? Why do you want to get rid of controls in
                    education? We are not ready yet. We still have a job to do; we want to hold on
                    to the controls as long as we can.” There was a real difference in our policies
                    between us.</p>
                <p>The French, undoubtedly, were the most tenacious, or I might say, the most
                    consistent of the western occupiers. They wanted to hold on to every bit of
                    control as long as possible. The British were the most relaxed. Timing didn't
                    mean much to them. We were somewhere in the middle.</p>
                <p>What happened was that when in 1949 the State Department took over, we decided
                    that we had to have a change of methods.The military was no longer an acceptable
                    instrument of occupation policy. We had to make do without it. There were two
                    key arguments or key pillars of this new policy. One was that we had to hand the
                    responsibility for “reeducation” over to the Germans. Actually a beginning had
                    been made earlier when Secretary Byrnes made his speech in Stuttgart in
                    1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary of State, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Secretary of State, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to '46.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: He indicated then that this was the way things had to go. When we
                    took over in 1949, we started on it in earnest.</p>
                <p>The other pillar of the new policy was money. We decided that democratization
                    couldn't be done on a starvation budget like the one Clay had for education. It
                    had to be a big program or it made no sense having any program at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking when we say “we” for the State

                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes, the State Department.</p>

                <p>The Great Expansion of The Exchange of Persons Program</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: I remember that I was discussing the problems with my staff. We were
                    planning the future of the exchange program. Until then the exchange program had
                    been a mere trickle of, at best, a few hundred people. I said, “If you really
                    mean it, it has got to be not a hundred but a thousand — not only a thousand but
                    I would say three thousand people per annum.” I remember one budget director,
                    Irving Schwarz spoke up and said, “Why not 3,600?” I asked, “Do you think we can
                    do it?” Somebody said, “We've never done anything like this before. We have no
                    idea, but we can try.” So we started. Eventually we moved thousands of people
                    back and forth during those critical first years of the McCloy High
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was 1949 to 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes. In those years we moved a total of about 14,000 people. In other
                    words, it was a sort of “Cultural Marshall Plan.” We had a budget which by
                    today's standards may not be too impressive. It was between 50 and 60 million
                    dollars per year. If you translate it into present monetary values, it would
                    probably be ten times that much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For just one country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: For one country. Other countries benefited from it —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: — because later we extended the program to France, to Switzerland, to
                    Sweden and to other European countries to make it —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The lower countries, Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: — to get them into the act. The point was that instead of us telling
                    Germans what to do we invited them to come over here and to look for models that
                    they might want to use upon their return to Germany. That was the secret of our
                    success. It worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the exchange program was one element of this
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We also at the time — I know because I was involved in it
                        myself — had a number of cultural centers. America always had these, with
                        libraries and speakers and exhibitions and various different seminars,
                        etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which also were — do you think that they were also an
                        important element?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Oh, yes, they were an essential part of it. So was Radio Station RIAS
                    in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: So was Die Neue Zeitung, a daily newspaper which we published in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Frankfurt and Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: And in Munich. These were also like Huete and Neue Aus which we
                    published in addition. All this was part of what was called the public affairs
                    program under the direction of Shepard Stone. A publisher Ralph Nicholson was
                    the first director. He was followed by Shepard Stone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Mickey Boerner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes, then came Mickey Boerner. There were many others who followed.
                    But there was another thing which turned public affairs into public
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>The Complete Integration In The Department Stateof Political, Economic and Public
                    Diplomacy Programming</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>You see, in Washington as well as in Germany, the key elements of our
                    administration consisting of politics, economics and public affairs, were not
                    isolated operations, but worked as a team. That was true in Germany, where Shep
                    Stone belonged to the inner counsel of High Commissioner McCloy. But that was
                    also true in Washington where I, as one of the directors in the Bureau of German
                    Affairs, formed a team with my political and economic colleagues, all under the
                    guidance, first, of Robert Murphy, and later on of Hank Byroade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: In Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Then came Jimmy Riddleberger. The German Bureau was a team. I was as
                    much involved in general policy discussions as the political and economic
                    officers were in public diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, that was really quite unusual for the Department
                        of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: It was absolutely unique; it was the first time it ever happened, and
                    I'm afraid it was also the last time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, why did this kind of thing happen and who
                        were the motivators of this? I mean there has to be some kind of — because
                        normally the Department of State was politically, or they weren't even
                        economically oriented at that time — they became economically oriented.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now here you have one operation that really combined the essential elements of
                    diplomacy. How could that have happened?</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: It was largely a result of personalities. If we hadn't had a man like
                    Robert Murphy on top ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KELLERMANN: — who was fully familiar and in complete sympathy with all aspects of
                    his Bureau including public affairs, and later his successor, Hank Byroade, who
                    had the same philosophy; and if you hadn't had a man like McCloy in Germany, to
                    whom we gave a package of recommendations when we went over there to plan and
                    organize our operation in Germany, we would not have had the success which we
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People like Benjamin Buttenwieser and —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Buttenwieser, Bob Bowie and Allan Lightner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — and Shep.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: — and Shep Stone. They all were part of the team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Later on, when we drifted apart again, when USIA was created and took
                    over the public affairs program, I was asked at that time what I thought of the
                    transfer. I always felt and said then that we would never reach the same impact
                    which we had in those critical five, six, seven years in Germany. We operated as
                    a unit, as a family really.</p>
                <p>We all respected each other and felt mutually responsible.We were lucky to have
                    some outstanding men in European-German affairs. I mentioned Bob Murphy. There
                    were others. There was Hank Byroade; there was Perry Lautoff; there was Jack
                    Reinstein, there was Cecil Lyon. Those were the people who worked in unison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any consideration at that time both in Germany
                        and in the State Department — you agreed that there were things that we
                        ought to be doing in the field of public affairs — educational exchange,
                        cultural centers, libraries, newspapers, other publications, exhibitions.
                        Was there any talk about to whom we should direct our programs? You couldn't
                        possibly talk to the whole German population. Was there a consideration that
                        we ought to concentrate on specific elements —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, we were lucky again, lucky first in terms of personalities. We
                    were lucky to find a man like Adenauer with whom you could have the necessary
                    dialogue. His relationship to McCloy was outstanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We found a man in Berlin like Ernst Reuter, a most courageous man that was in
                    charge of Berlin at a very critical moment.</p>
                <p>You had a man like Erhard, who was the economic miracle worker. We were lucky to
                    find many talented people in the press, in the radio, in education. They were
                    the ones who served first as the sounding board, and later as allies in our
                    common enterprise.</p>
                <p>Difference In 1945-52 Policy From Allied PolicyIn 1920's After World War I</p>
                <p>All of them subscribed to the same general philosophy. I think I ought to point
                    that out because there was difference, a very significant difference between the
                    '20s and the '40s.</p>
                <p>In the '20s, after World War I, the allies moved into Germany. The key to their
                    policy then was reparations. Germans were expected to pay astronomical sums,
                    allied troops marched into the Ruhr and the Rhineland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: The difference between the '20s and the '40s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '20s, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes. On the other hand, the '20s also witnessed the first genuine
                    attempt of Germany to become a democracy and a republic, to boot. There were
                    reasons why it collapsed, lots of reasons. When Hitler came to power, he found
                    fertile soil for his conquest: reparations, occupation, inflation, you name it,
                    had prepared the ground — it was a miserable existence for most Germans. But
                    those were not the only reasons for the collapse of the Republic. I think one of
                    the elements that played a part was the fact that the German democracy and the
                    Weimar Republic never got the kind of support and understanding from the outside
                    that it needed in order to prevail. I think that was a contributory element to
                    the downfall of the Republic.</p>
                <p>Now those of us in the '40s who remembered and resolved that the mistake of the
                    '20s must not be repeated. This time, we had to do our level best to give all
                    the support we could muster to the upcoming new democratic Germans.</p>
                <p>We had to find them, naturally. The idea of helping to build a democratic Germany
                    rather than to exact reparations that Germany couldn't pay, was one of the
                    guiding motives of our policy, and you might say of our public diplomacy because
                    in order to do it you had to go down to the grass roots.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was contrary to the policies at that time, at least
                        initially, of our allies, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: No, I couldn't say that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly, the Soviet Union, but —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, that goes without saying, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French and the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, their methods were different. The principles, and the principal
                    policies, which became a tripartite policy after the quadripartite policy
                    collapsed, when the Russians walked out of the Control Council. They were united
                    in their policy, but there methods were, I have to admit, quite different. As I
                    mentioned earlier, the French were doing a number of things that were
                    different.</p>
                <p>First of all, they catered to the intellectuals, and to a high-brow middle class
                    taste. They sent artists, philosophers and authors into Germany at an early
                    stage. They had Andre Gide come over to give lectures. They set up in Mainz a
                    elegant academy bench for the learned members of German society, which actually
                    never got going. I still see that marvelous room they had planned to use for
                    conferences, beautiful high-backed chairs, and nobody sitting in them except we,
                    the visitors.</p>
                <p>The British operated more by hit and miss. I talked to some of my British
                    colleagues and kept asking them, “Now when you were sent to Germany to do your
                    stuff, reeducate or whatever, what instructions were you given?” They said,
                    “Instructions? We didn't have any. We were told to go ahead and play it by
                    ear.”</p>
                <p>The British, as you know, are very good at playing by ear. They have a tradition
                    of ad hoc decision making that stretches over centuries. They did not do a bad
                    job altogether. Above all, as I said, they were far more relaxed, and were not
                    quite as systematic in their approach as we were. We got together with the
                    British, and we worked out certain programs with them. We extended our exchange
                    program to their zone. American Houses were set up there as well, and our
                    newspapers got distributed there. So, for all practical purposes, it was a
                    unified operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you referred earlier to the fact that we were going
                        to do things differently in 1945 from what we had done in the 1920s,
                        vis-a-vis Germany, you said “We”. Again, I'm interested in personalities.
                        Were there specific people that you know of or remember that were
                        particularly instrumental in this yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, before the end of hostilities you had a number of groups,
                    people — one was headed by Archibald MacLeish — who were working on plans for
                    reeducation and democratization of Germany. I was asked somewhat recently by
                    German journalists whether we had a unified plan served on a silver platter when
                    we started. No, we did not. We, too, worked by, I wouldn't say hit or miss, but
                    by inspiration and by trial and error. The program which we started was
                    different from the one that evolved towards the end. We extemporized and
                    improvised as we went along. But there was an overall plan for a public affairs
                    program that we proposed when McCloy took over, and that we revised in step with
                    political developments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The approach was entirely different, and the approach was

                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: The approach was a different one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — to bring people back into the universe of a sort of

                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes. After all, Germany had been cut off from the rest of the world
                    for about 12 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did the Cold War, which also really started at
                        about the same time, how did that impact on our program in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, it had a fairly decisive impact. There's no question about it.
                    The Cold War as well as the war in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, of course, the Berlin blockade.</hi>

                <p>KELLERMANN: —and the Berlin blockade.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KELLERMANN: It accelerated a process which we had envisaged in the beginning
                    would take 10, 20 years, who knows? In 1948-49, it became quite clear that
                    things wouldn't work out the way we had envisioned them; Germany would not
                    continue as a unified country. There was the cleavage between East and West. The
                    question was: Would the West Germans go east, or would they stay west? It was a
                    real problem for a while. Later, we found out that most of our fears were
                    unfounded. The Germans had made up their mind that they were going to stay in
                    the West. As a result, we took them into the family. We did something for which
                    we were criticized for a while, here as well as in Germany. We put them back in
                    uniform. Nobody had expected that this would happen at such an early date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back then in 1956, '55-'56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: I don't remember exactly the date. NATO came into existence earlier;
                    Germany was put back into the European community. Then came Berlin, and Berlin
                    turned most Americans toward Germany once again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was speaking to Michael Weyl on the same subject a
                        few weeks ago, and I had also mentioned that from my perspective this whole
                        discipline of public diplomacy, and the two sources that I mentioned
                        earlier, he also stated that the two strands came together in 1947-48, when
                        suddenly, because of the conditions, the East-West conditions, that had
                        arisen from the Cold War, suddenly the program for public diplomacy — public
                        affairs in Germany — received more resources because we felt very strongly
                        that we needed to have the Germans on our side. Therefore, more money was
                        given to this kind of program than theretofore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes, I would agree with him. That's quite correct, although it was
                    not part of our original policy. I would add one more thing. To me, public
                    diplomacy lacks one additional dimension — namely, inclusion in our overall
                    policy. I mean the active inclusion and participation not only at the governing
                    level but of all strata of society. This was mirrored again in our exchange
                    program, which included everybody from teenagers to cabinet officials, including
                    future chancellors and presidents who thus became graduates of our exchange
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is my definition of public diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Well, that is the legitimate one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: It seems to me, that is the public diplomacy par excellence.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one additional element, at least in my estimation, in
                        my definition of the term, is the reciprocal part. In other words, that as
                        we convey information about our society and our policies to all strata of,
                        say, another country's society, we at the same time learn it is a two-way
                        street.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: It is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unless we understand what drives another society, we can't
                        possibly be successful in projecting our society to them. In other words,
                        it's an absolute two-way street. This is, of course, one of the problems
                        that USIA has faced over the years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now I think that it's more and better understood than it was in earlier times
                    with the earlier directors of USIA, who felt that their only interest was to
                    give information to, you know, to send out data and information and people, and
                    not to take into consideration the culture, the history, the traditions of the
                    people with whom we're communicating.</p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: Yes, but we, too, made this mistake in the beginning. It was really
                    never State Department philosophy. We always looked at it in terms of a
                    reciprocal, bilateral or multi-lateral relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the exchange program was a bilateral —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: That was supposed to be, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, also in our cultural centers, in our libraries,
                        in our communications process it was always a dialogue. It was not a
                        lecturing process; it was a dialogue that we tried to implement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: At the same time we never lost sight of what we were there to do. I
                    mean we had a job to do and we did it. Of course, the only question that remains
                    to be asked, and I don't think any one of us can answer it yet with any amount
                    of assurance, is, “How well did we succeed”. That is, after all, the nutshell of
                    all our efforts. Unless we can come up with some positive answer — and we should
                    be able to do it by now —we would have wasted an awful lot of time, money and
                    man-power.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I remember one thing. We were in France not so long ago, on the Riviera. My wife
                    and I were sitting in a restaurant one evening and a young couple was sitting
                    next to us. We didn't know at first what language they were speaking. It turned
                    out to be German, and so we talked to them. It turned out that they both were
                    journalists and it also turned out that the husband had formerly been a member
                    of our editorial staff on the Neue Zeitung. I told him that was a program I was
                    connected with at its heyday. He said, “I'm so glad to hear you say that, and I
                    want to say one more thing which I always wanted to say to somebody who worked
                    on it, namely that your program has formed my generation, literally.” I was
                    quite moved. Here was a bit of evidence that we had done something useful. The
                    man had remembered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this note, unless you have anything else that you might
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KELLERMANN: I could go on forever. I mean I have so much to add. I wrote a book,
                    and I'm trying to peddle it to publishers, in which I've put in a great deal of
                    this material.(Main interview was concluded)</p>
                <p>Addendum to Transcript of Interview</p>
                <p>Conventional wisdom and traditional diplomatists insist — and will forever — that
                    PUBLIC DIPLOMACY is a contradiction in adjectu, irreconcilable components of an
                    equation that simply is not solvable. Diplomacy, again according to
                    traditionalist members of the trade, is by its very definition a private,
                    generally secret one-on-one encounter, an activity conducted in camera by
                    experts who depend on the secrecy of negotiations for the success of their
                    business. That the results of their efforts eventually may become public, by
                    indiscretion, leaks or the passing of time, and [the fact that] that they may
                    ultimately, though not always benefit the public is a consequence not
                    necessarily germane to the function of diplomacy nor to the original intent of
                    the action per se. So far Nicholson and the rest of his school have actually
                    suggested that not only secrecy but duplicity are criteria of diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In recent years, quite in contrast to and even in defiance of the traditionalist
                    wisdom, diplomacy has gained new attributes and objectives and also different
                    dimensions of which “public diplomacy” and “multilateral diplomacy” are prime
                    examples. The latter, of course, is the prerogative and the instrument of
                    multilateral relations as conducted in multilateral agencies, such as the United
                    Nations and its specialized agencies and affiliates. The former, however, is the
                    functional offshoot of policies aimed at involving non-governmental groups and
                    individuals actively and responsibly in the policies of their government through
                    government to people and eventually people to people contacts.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>An example par excellence has been the program initiated and operated in Germany
                    in the aftermath of World War II. After the termination of the occupation and
                    the OMGUS regime policy by fiat, the Office of German Public Affairs of the
                    State Department, which I directed at the time, endeavored to get the German
                    populace directly and personally engaged in the democratization (misnamed
                    reeducation) process, thereby paralleling and actually undergirding the
                    political and economic twin policies to let Germans restructure their
                    governmental apparatus from the bottom up by first rebuilding local and state
                    authority and eventually the federal government.</p>
                <p>The key element of this “reorientation” effort, but by no means the only one, was
                    the so-called exchange of persons program which moved within the span of less
                    than eight years 14,000 persons to and from Germany, the bulk going from Germany
                    to the United States and, the rest to other (European) democracies. The critical
                    criteria of the program, as I pointed out in my book, were that it was massive,
                    target oriented, stratified, innovative, interzonal and, above all,
                    participatory. Germans not only were the principal beneficiaries but they were
                    directly involved in the selection and follow-up. Moreover, by its very
                    pervasiveness, the program included representatives of all key strata of German
                    society, from the cabinet, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, academia to the
                    professions, farmers, labor, students and teenagers (the last group, teenagers,
                    continues to this very day). In effect it was a “Cultural Marshall Plan.”
                    Furthermore, instead of enforcing a change of institutions and reforming the
                    (educational) system by direct intervention, as had been the practice of
                    Military Government, Germans who came to the United States were given the
                    opportunity to seek and find their own models of democratic institutions and
                    practices for application, after appropriate adaptation, to their domestic
                    needs.</p>
                <p>When we speak of “public diplomacy” today, the German public affairs program of
                    the late forties and early fifties meets the test. It was designed to give the
                    democratic elements in Germany another chance to prove their mettle by
                    instituting democratic reforms on all levels of public and private life, that is
                    to say, by rebuilding a government of law, by restoring an educational system
                    open to all, by reviving a democratic press and by assuring free citizenship
                    participation in all these endeavors. This is precisely what the allies failed
                    to do after the end of World War I when they did not come to the aid of a
                    fledgling democracy that was attacked every day of its short life by enemies
                    from within and without. But this was also the first major breakthrough in
                    public diplomacy of note and depth unprecedented and so far unequaled in the
                    annals of American history.</p>
