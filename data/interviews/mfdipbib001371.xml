                <p>[This interview was not edited by Mr. Imbrey prior to his death]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning, could you tell me about when
                        and where you were born and something about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes. I was born across the river in New Jersey because we had a
                    gynecologist there and that was in 1921. One week later I was back in Manhattan
                    and so I was a child in New York City. I grew up in New York City and
                    unfortunately my passport reads Hoboken. My wife was born in Kansas City,
                    Missouri, but she spent six months there and after that she was a childhood
                    delinquent. Well, I grew up in New York. We lived in fairly nice circumstances,
                    made what we call a Jewish migration from the West Side to the East Side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, tell me about your father. What did he do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: He was a lawyer mostly for industry and for various unions, various
                    clothing unions. He was rather successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: He was born in London of parents we were born in Krakow and he came to
                    the States I imagine in the late 1880s in 1888, 1889. He went to CCNY. He got
                    himself a law degree at NYU and practiced law almost continuously, he died in
                    1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On his side was the Jewish extraction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, my mother was born to royalty. Her grandfather was little Julius
                    Harberg of the Sheriff of New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the Harbergs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: He was Italian. He led the cotillion. He grew up in very nice
                    circumstances. However, when my mother married my father her family totally
                    turned her off. She was born of German Jews. My father was what they considered
                    a Polish Jew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the distinctions were very strong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, boy. So, her side of the family never spoke to her again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? I mean because the Harbergs were and may still be
                        certainly a very well known society Jewish family in high society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, where did your mother, what sort of education
                        did your mother have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: My mother's education was interrupted by a murder in front of her eyes. A
                    jealous husband killed what he perceived to be her mother's lover. So, it was a
                    book salesman coming to sell books and he killed them both and shot himself in
                    front of the children and in front of my mother. That colored her life
                    tremendously. That and the rejection of the family that she married into. I
                    don't know about her education. She could speak German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know how they met or when they met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, I don't know very much about their life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you as a child growing up in New York, where in
                        New York did you live?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, we lived first on West End Avenue, which is over on the West Side,
                    then my mother got very tired of cooking. So, we moved to a hotel on Central
                    Park West. Very fancy and dinner was served at night on one of those carts that
                    come up to your room and all the dishes had domes on them. Very elegant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find growing up in sort of, when did that
                        happen? Was that when you were pretty small?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, I was about ten or eleven. I guess it was then. In the meantime, I
                    was going to a fairly rough school, public school with a very mixed people,
                    Italians, Greeks, certainly Blacks and it was a rough and tumble sort of place.
                    Then I was put into Horace Mann school. Do you know Horace Mann?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I spent the equivalent of the four high school years at Horace Mann.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about at the pre-high school time at the public school. How did you
                    find, I mean how did you do there, was it a sort of a fight for survival?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, no. In those days the teachers were very strict and they demanded the
                    same thing of everyone and what happened in the yard later, was the kids played
                    stickball instead of fighting each other they, sports allowed a certain amount
                    of violence to be concentrated in a better channel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about for a sort of an elementary school before the
                        high school drill, what interested you, I mean, sports, books, movies, what
                        have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Books more than anything else. I was not really addicted to sports except
                    to keep up with the guys, but I really liked books. I liked my stamp collection
                    and because of the foreign element in it I think from early on I was attracted
                    about knowledge about other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at home or the hotel that was home. In the
                        first place, did you have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I have one sister, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When there was a discussion of events in the world and
                        all, I mean, did politics or literature or something else come into the
                        conversation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Very much so. My father had a number of friends who liked to gather at
                    the house and after their bridge game they certainly went into politics, not so
                    much New York politics. I don't think anybody was interested in that. They were
                    interested in what was going on in the world and I certainly heard those
                    conversations and I enjoyed them.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, while you were growing up did you, your father was involved with what,
                    corporate?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Trade unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trade unions. In such a trade did David Dubinsky get in
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I don't know whether he probably knew Dubinsky. He had several
                    organizations. He had the tie union and shirt makers union among others. He
                    argued some cases before the Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were growing up, did the Depression hit
                        you? Did that have much of an effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Not at first. My father was into real estate and all around him the
                    people who were into the stock market crashed with the stock market and my
                    father was doing very well because things were going well in his field. Then
                    came the disaster. About 1935 or so, maybe '36, the market fell out of real
                    estate and that's when my father felt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this affect you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It didn't really affect us much. My father would come home yelling and
                    screaming “We're going to the poor house.” He never did. My mother would go out
                    and buy a fur coat. It seemed, no, nothing much ever happened. We were not
                    really hit terribly and then there was a recovery and my father always had his
                    practice, so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it living in a hotel? What was that Bindlemans?
                        That little kid, a little girl who lived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Madeline.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Madeline.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, it wasn't like that. Not quite that kind of a hotel, it was a very
                    good hotel. Naturally I made friends with the janitor and his son, and the
                    janitor's son had an endless supply of dirty books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The little ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: The little ones, yes. It wasn't Thimble Thin. It was Popeye and
                    Olive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of the comics had their counterparts in the dirty. I
                        remember I used to get hold of those, too. I found out what life was all
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, get a wonderful education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Horace Mann. You were at Horace from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: 1935 to 1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Horace Mann like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, the teachers there prided themselves of teaching at the college
                    level, or so they thought and they were all very good. It was mostly a Jewish
                    crowd, Jewish boys, a couple of Italians, a couple of Christians got in somehow
                    and there was a good deal of competition. The competition was heavy and the
                    grading was strict, but the teachers were very available and the classes as you
                    could imagine were anywhere from eight to fifteen.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you sort of concentrate at anything?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: I tried to concentrate in languages. I took Latin and then I took Greek
                    and French as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You continued reading I assume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any books that particularly struck you as
                        influential or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Gosh, there's just so many. I really was very taken by The Iliad, The
                    Odyssey, and The Golden Bow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Frazier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, I liked that very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the exploration of myth I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you looking at, I mean this was a time real
                        events were happening in the Far East and Europe particularly as the
                        precursor to World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these things that would be discussed either at school
                        or home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Very much so. We had classes in current events and in world affairs and
                    those things were brought to our attention, but not as much as they might have
                    been. We were very heavy into history of every kind and there's just so many
                    hours a day. So, we certainly knew about them, we certainly were told about them
                    and lectured about them. There were even guest lecturers that came to the place
                    and they let us in.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: The World Sun. That old one. No, The Mirror and The News were not

                <p>IMBREY: What was the one that came after, not The Post, it was a very
                    intellectual magazine that came in the very beginning of the war about 1940.
                    Well, anyway, if you were caught reading that you were considered really a
                    little bit too intellectual for words.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your family practice Judaism at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, not at all. My mother was a total atheist. My father I think would
                    have called himself an agnostic and never once was I ever taken into a temple,
                    ever.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering whether the problems that were happening in Germany
                    particularly at this time during the Hitler time prior to World War II intrude
                    on your — I mean, was this something that was ever discussed?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, by all means. It was. We knew about it and my family contributed
                    monetarily to various Jewish organizations.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I wanted to go to Cornell and I got a letter from them saying I would
                    have been accepted except for the Jewish quota. As a matter of fact in those
                    days we accepted that very readily because if they didn't have a Jewish quota
                    they would have had 90% of the class New York Jews. So, then somebody told me
                    about North Carolina and, oh, I had to go to Chapel Hill.</p>
                <p>

                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About the Jewish quota I was interviewing somebody who
                        graduated from the Brooklyn High School of Science and said that they wanted
                        to go to MIT, but they would only take three people from there because the
                        classes were mainly very fine Jewish students, but there it was.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, so you went to the University of North

                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '39 to '42. Now, at this point the war saved my neck. I was flunking out.
                    I was a terrible student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It never occurred to me to visit my advisor and so I kept on taking
                    courses that I liked. I took Greek, of course, and Sanskrit. I also took
                    chemistry and math, which I flunked three times in a row. Had no head for it and
                    I only found out much later that if you took a class in a language you didn't
                    have to take math or chemistry. I was away in spades if I had not taken those
                    two things. So, came the war and the call to arms. I said, “That's me.” I left
                    school after the junior year and I went into the army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I enlisted in '42. Yes. About September of '42.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>IMBREY: They looked into my proud background and they sent me to the Signal
                    Corps. From the Signal Corps, they sent me to Kansas City to take high speed
                    Morse code. Now that was a real drag. I was out there for about four or five
                    months and I got up to a very high speed for 36 loops a minute, which is rather
                    fast. If it's going that fast you have to learn to type. So, they taught typing,
                    too, which has stayed with me forever. Then, having gotten this high-speed
                    thing, they sent me to an infantry organization as a Signal Corps radio
                    operator. Well, one thing I hadn't known. When you get on a net in the Signal
                    Corps you have to go at the speed of the slowest man in the network. Well, all
                    of us there, in my gang, could go very fast. You got guys in there who go “dit,
                    dit, dit, dash, dit” and you know, go a speed of about one a minute, I said I'll
                    die if I stay in this place. So, I figured out a way of getting out of that.
                    Now, do you want all of this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It's rather funny. I had enough linguistic experience to know I could
                    choose a language that I could learn fairly quickly and I didn't want German nor
                    Italian. I am not esoteric enough, but I knew that Malay was easily learned and
                    there was no real grammar to it. I got myself a book on Malay and I learned
                    some. I taught myself about 500 words, just the words in Malay. You know in
                    Malay you just put them one after the other and you don't have too much
                    grammar.</p>
                <p>I applied for the ASTP (Armed Services Training Program) which was for languages.
                    I put down Malay. They said, “how did you learn Malay?” I said my father was a
                    planter. One could get away with a lot. They gave me a test. They didn't have
                    anybody who spoke Malay and so they got a book and they copied some sentences
                    out of it where they had both the English on one side and the Malay on the
                    other. Well, it was the book, the grammar book they give to planters when they
                    are first on the job and they have to learn enough to deal with the run of the
                    plantation. So, it was very basic and the words were like this: “If you do not
                    tap the tree correctly I shall have you whipped.” But I knew all the words, so
                    they said okay you know Malay so they put me into a program and I went to
                    Hindustani. Then some seven or eight months of Hindustani four hours a day and
                    by the end of that time we spoke pretty good Hindustani and as a matter of fact
                    where I went out first to Karachi there were all of these poets who arrived
                    among us who were speaking high Hindustani. I was with the Indian Army so I
                    learned army orders, which was the same as Hindustani.</p>
                <p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: 1943 I guess. Yes, the end of '43.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, after the Hindustani course I was picked up by OSS and so from then
                    on I spent the war as OSS. I spent most of the war in Burma, but also in Ceylon,
                    now Sri Lanka. We had a base; Lord Louis Mountbatten was the chief of the whole
                    operations there. He had his base in Kandi. So, we had a group. I don't remember
                    what I was doing. I don't think I was doing very much when we were in Kandi, so
                    we got out of there and went to Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Burma at that time, was Burma, was it completely
                        occupied by the Japanese or was this the British counterattack?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, what had happened was that Windy, Orde Wingate had successfully
                    mounted a number of operations with his Chindits and took a hell of a, not a
                    beating, but the fighting was very intense and then came the Morris Task Force,
                    the Americans and there the fighting was very intense. About that time there
                    were Merrill's Marauders they were there and OSS detachments were behind the
                    lines. Now, at that time the Japanese had faced so many enemies in so many
                    places that they had really no way of getting their goods and services to Burma
                    and so the Japanese troops in Burma were really ill-fed, had no medical supplies
                    to speak of and were on their last legs. They were still fighting like tigers,
                    but we were there at a time, or I was there at a time when the war had already
                    been won and we were just making things more difficult for them, but they were
                    no longer anywhere near the fighting force that the others had to face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, let's go back to Ceylon first because I had one great job there
                    that was very funny. They used to send a submarine out to the states at Sunda
                    and they would find a fishing boat with a couple of people on it and take the
                    people aboard the submarine, tie the boat to the submarine and come back to
                    Tricomoli and Ceylon. There they would teach them how to operate a radio, take
                    them back, put the boat back on top of the water with the people in it and these
                    chaps would send out radio instructions on Japanese ship traffic in their area.
                    So, there it is on my record, Malay speaker and they got out to Tricomoli, so I
                    went out to Tricomoli and so there I met up with the Malays. Well, I didn't know
                    what would happen, except I said to them something like hello and they said, oh
                    you speak Malay. They were so happy that somebody spoke a few words and then we
                    got along very well and the language sort of invented itself as it came along.
                    Then I had this other job of getting them, a lot of them we didn't want to send
                    back to Malay. It was too dangerous for them. So, we would send them to India
                    and we would pile them in the nosecone of a plane and send them over to India
                    and then escort them over to a coffee estate where we kept them there. Of
                    course, when they got in the nose cone of the plane and you know Plexiglas... Do
                    you know what a nose cone looks like? You look down and there's nothing
                    there.</p>
                <p>Q: Scares the hell out of you.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Scared the hell out of me because I was with them. In fact, I went back
                    to Burma and was actually all sorts of things. We were blowing up bridges and
                    behind the lines we were setting fires. One thing that we did that was rather
                    funny. One of our people had the idea of using the yellow parachute dye, which
                    is very persistent. So we sent out word up and down the Chimquin River that if
                    ever the river should turn to gold it means that the Japanese would be defeated.
                    So, we turned the river to gold, we dumped in all of the parachutes and they
                    actually floated and it looked like gold. The people believed it. We were doing
                    that sort of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, no, the Japanese had really done a masterful job on them. They hated
                    the Japanese. They hated them. We had our own tribals and we were training some
                    of the tribal people up in the northeast part of the country and they were very
                    friendly to us. The Burmese are quite different. There's the Burmans, the
                    Cochins, the Corins; they're all a little different. The Corins had earlier been
                    approached by the, that is in the '30s, by Protestant missionaries. They're all
                    Christians; they're all hymn singers. They're very easy to get along with. The
                    Burmans are all Buddhists. They are a little bit more touchy. But all of them
                    had been terribly used by the Japanese.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: No, I came in with the Battle of Mitchina and we were on one end of the
                    airfield and the Japanese were at the other end and just about the time I got
                    out of the plane the last Japanese was driven off the airfield.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, Stilwell was already in Ethiopia or somewhere else. Slim was the
                    commanding general then. For a while I was with the Thirteenth Indian Division
                    on the assumption that someone could speak Hindustani. I was a sergeant, but of
                    course they put me with the officers and the officers would not speak any Indian
                    language with me. It would be like saying, you can't speak English. It was an
                    insult to address them in their own language. But with the soldiers I could get
                    along; you know if you ask for a pot of water or something like that I would do
                    it in Hindi.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where did you end up in the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, in Rangoon with another wonderful sortie. The British then accused
                    us of attempting to arm Burmese rebels who were seeking independence from
                    British rule. Burma was a crown colony and they said we had armed all, which we
                    had, we had armed a great number of these people. They said to get back these
                    guns because we don't want them around, we don't want them to have independence,
                    they're not ready for it. So, a couple of us were sent out. Each one of us had a
                    truck and a Burmese guide. I went many, many miles in the attempt to get back
                    the weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I get to a village and I'd say that I need the weapons back, the war is over,
                    let's have the weapons, yes, the weapons. Earlier in the colonial period the
                    British had armed every headman with a shotgun. It was a symbol of his
                    authority. When the war came they all buried them. So, the guy would go to the
                    burial place, unearth this rusty shotgun. “Here's your gun.” What about the
                    submachine guns, what about the pistols, what about the stingers? Oh, no, we
                    never had those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can imagine. Once you give a gun away you don't
                        really get it back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, I came back I think with about six rusty rifles and that was after
                    about two weeks that I'd gone down to the whole area and I was really ashamed of
                    coming in and all the other guys had the same experience. Nobody ever got any
                    weapons. So, what we did was to break out a couple of cartons of 45s, clean them
                    off, cleaned them all up and gave them to the British. “Here are your guns.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you afterwards, I mean here you are, not
                        having graduated from a university, you've got your Malay and your OSS
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, when I went back to North Carolina after the war, they said well
                    look at your record here you have four hours a day, seven months, that
                    constitutes a major. I said, “I've got a major?” He said, “Yes, all you have to
                    do is take a couple of courses and you're out of here.” I graduated from North
                    Carolina, the only graduate of Hindu study ever to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you graduated when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, went to, I got into the import/export business. I thought that would
                    be interesting and they sent me to Cuba to Havana. I was in Havana for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when Havana was really jumping.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, boy. It was between Batista. Batista had been president before and
                    after I came. In the middle was a guy named Grau San Martin, who must have
                    ranked with Mobutu, Mugabe, all the thieves. Grau was an expert and I had good
                    success in selling our products, but the factories hadn't really turned to
                    civilian production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you selling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, we had hospital supplies, then a plastic factory. The plastics were
                    rather new there and this was a rather extravagant kind of plastic out of which
                    you could make numerous things, but they weren't up to production so I could get
                    an order for thousands of pisspots for a hospital, but they'd send six, and we
                    had a radio. It was a $10 radio, which they desperately wanted. I could get
                    about eight of those. Now you get one in thousands. So, finally after a year I
                    gave up. I wasn't making any money for myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, I found out that OSS now had roots in CIG, Central Intelligence
                    which Truman eventually turned into the CIA and I applied for a job there. I had
                    support for that and in 1948 I began with CIA.</p>
                <p>Q: How was the recruitment at that time? What sort of things, I mean, were
                    they?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Most of the people had been in the OSS and others were from East Coast
                    colleges for the most part and I think OSS was the big background. If you were
                    in OSS it was not too much of a problem getting in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they want you to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, first of all there was training. They took me in at a princely sum;
                    I was a P-3, which I think was the equivalent of a GS-9. Well, that was like
                    $3,000 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: So, that was pretty good. At any rate, after training, let's see. They
                    sent us to various courses in world affairs and in the countries of our
                    interest. I was immediately singled out for India because of the language and
                    the fact that I'd been there before and prepared for a post in Bombay. And we
                    had a little trouble with the State Department as you can imagine getting our
                    people into various posts. The two brothers Allen and John Foster Dulles.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is still 1948, so Foster didn't get in until
                        '53?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, Dean Acheson was there at the time, but the State Department was
                    jumpy as usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was a new thing, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes. Then the guy whom I was replacing, Lennox Fogg, his parents were of
                    the Fogg Museum in Boston. This chap had a drinking problem that culminated with
                    the thought that he might be able to fly. He flew out the first floor or second
                    story window where he was living. Didn't do him any good. He was too drunk, I
                    guess. He survived very well. The State Department said that's enough and they
                    said to the CIA to get that man replaced right away. So, immediately I was
                    shipped out there to replace this guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in '48?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes. '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the great partition of India take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '47.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '47? So, it was sort of immediately afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bombay from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '48 to '50. Just two years. The ambassador there was Timberlake. He was a
                    leader and ambassador to the Congo and Peru and a few other places. We got along
                    splendidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were in Bombay rather than New Delhi, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, that was in Bombay. It was a Consulate General. There were all sorts
                    of people to meet there. First of all there was a navy. We were interested in
                    the Indian navy's ability to cooperate with us and CIA developed sources there.
                    A lot of funny things that were going on there, the guy that I had there was the
                    chief of operations for the Indian navy and he was an admiral and his
                    headquarters were in Bombay. One of the things that interested him that he tried
                    to get me interested in was pornographic pictures, which he had by the ton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you already had good training with the comic
                        books.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, I had wonderful training for them, but he said, “Do you think you
                    could get me some others?” So, I didn't tell headquarters about this because I
                    thought that was a little risky, but I had a friend who was the chief of
                    station, Dick Clise, in New Delhi. I said, “Dick, what are we going to do?” And,
                    he said, “Don't worry. I have sources for that sort of stuff and they produce a
                    lot of the stuff here.” What they have are these little books, some are even
                    typed scripts of various methods of intercourse you wouldn't believe. So, I
                    always had a supply of these things to give him and so our relationship was very
                    good. The only funny thing about that was I went to Delhi on one occasion with
                    my wife and four of us went out to dinner and on our way to the restaurant a guy
                    came running pell-mell with a handful of these things and saying, “Mr. Clise,
                    Mr. Clise, I have some more for you.” His wife didn't know anything about
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a wife. When did she appear on the
                        scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: We were married in Bombay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: She was the sister of my roommate in college. I used to visit my roommate
                    in New York when she was a little girl and eventually we got together and I
                    proposed when drunk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. What was your impression of how India was settling
                        in as a new nation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>IMBREY: There was enough time for Bombay. There were a lot of people who were
                    being oppressed in Pakistan, the new Pakistan and particularly the Sindhi
                    population. Sindhis are a national element from the province of Sin in Pakistan.
                    They're generally distrusted for very good reasons. They're very sly people and
                    they have a lot of attributes that are not particularly inviting. These people
                    came down to Bombay in droves, set up shops, displaced merchants that had been
                    there for years and Bombay was seething. There was a lot of trouble. A lot of
                    fighting in the streets. A lot of loss of control, but it was a very interesting
                    place to be of course. The key to Indian society for most Americans who,
                    especially those who were in Bombay with parcees who are a very cultivated and
                    interesting bunch, you have sympathies with both the Muslims and the Hindus. By
                    now by getting with the parcees you could expand tremendously your cover of
                    friendships and relationships. So, Bombay was in that sense a very good post to
                    begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your relations with the State Department
                        people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: In my case, it turned out very well. The ambassador...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador or the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, well, Timberlake, consul general, yes. Ambassador Timberlake stood in
                    as father of the bride when I married my wife in Bombay and all the other people
                    were extremely supportive and happy to have me along. I had no enemies and I
                    appreciated they all had jobs to do and we worked together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find some of the Indian government? Did they
                        pay much attention to your activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, as a matter of fact I had good relationships with the police and that
                    was one of my chores of my job was to find out from the police what was going
                    on. We had several communist parties at the time and that, of course, was of
                    tremendous interest to us and to the police. So, I got a great deal of
                    information from them that was reportable and through them I also got relations
                    with labor unions and spent a lot of time developing relations with the labor
                    unions who with the nature of their work were very upset and concerned about
                    communism in their ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Indian communists at that time which you had seen,
                        were they sort of local grown or were they a disciplined group coming from
                        or getting orders from Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>IMBREY: At first it was one united party under a man named Nikay Rondevey, a very
                    able politician who was elusive. He would have been arrested if they had ever
                    found him. He managed to get a number of people behind him. Moscow-oriented, and
                    certainly the Russians were supporting him to a good extent until the split of
                    the Russians with the Chinese, at which time a Maoist group grew up particularly
                    in the south of India. So, we were watching Membery very carefully, too. So,
                    between the police and my military contacts and the labor contacts I could
                    report a good deal on what was going on in the communist party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you cover Kerala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: The Kerala? Not then. Kerala had a consulate general in Madras and our
                    guy in Madras was supposedly covering it. Unfortunately, he too was an
                    alcoholic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the consul general of Madras was a</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, the consul general who was stationed there was unfortunately an
                    alcoholic.</p>
                <p>Q: That was part of the problem, wasn't it? I think in some of these places where
                    they've been doing this a long time, drinking becomes quite a way of life?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, in the Foreign Service we all drank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a real, real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, it was a problem and you probably remember yourself when the
                    houseboy came in with eighteen different kinds of liquor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, a lot of people were under the influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how did that work out for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, they sent me from Bombay; they said well you handled things so well
                    in Bombay with the first incident, why don't you go down to Madras and relieve
                    the situation there. So, they sent the guy in Madras home and I went down to
                    Madras with the kit and caboodle and family, down to Madras and then I did come
                    to Kerala.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Kerala of course for a long time was always looked
                        upon with great suspicion from the American point of view because there was
                        a very strong communist party there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, only after the Maoist thing and that sort of a caste thing. The man
                    who was in charge of that was a Nambuteripod. That is not only a family name,
                    but a caste name and a very high up caste name so you show a lot of respect
                    among the other castes. He was taken in by the Chinese and they were doing very
                    well in a community in which every third guy had a Ph.D. The most amazing thing
                    in all of Kerala is that the people are all so over-trained, over-educated and
                    splendidly over-educated, and, of course, there are no jobs. Who needs all of
                    these professors?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, they couldn't expand outside of the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: They had that problem, too, but they were tremendously intelligent and
                    the communist party appealed to them as a haven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were we doing? Were we trying to co-opt any of
                        these people or just report on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, Kerala was a specialty. You go about it in a peculiar way. For
                    example, there's a group in Kerala of Syrian Christians. They came over with
                    Thomas the apostle in the fourth century I think it was. They were Syrian
                    Christians. Those guys were amenable to recruitment and reporting. Then there
                    was another group the Maccabean Jews, the black Jews of India who have an area
                    around called Bajetown over on the west coast and their own synagogue and their
                    own tabernacle and God knows what and they were recruitables, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we seeing there, even if the Maoists were going
                        doing well there, it was sort of a self-sealed operation in that they really
                        couldn't penetrate the rest of Indian society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: There was a tremendous evolution and what began merely as a pocket
                    communist party in two different places spread. North of Madras is another
                    province called Ambhra and all of them were under the influence of this man
                    Ramadini who started a civil war. They sent the Indian army down there to deal
                    with this and so there were security situations for the whole subcontinent that
                    you reported on. In Madras I was the only one really reporting on that. So, we
                    had the consul general and two other people who had consular jobs. So, I had a
                    lot of responsibility in keeping the government informed on the status this
                    little war that was going on in Ambhra.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Indian officials at that time? Were
                        they concerned about what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, tremendously yes because their jobs depended on how they treated
                    their own people. We saw them regularly, we had good relations with a great many
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you able to find out what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Through agents. As I said we had agents that were Syrian, Christian,
                    Jewish and various Indian communities and we met surreptitiously, got our
                    information, submitted it. In those days we had to type it on the thatch forms,
                    remember those forms?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Were Indian officials in the central government
                        concerned about I suppose a somewhat obvious operation of the CIA person
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I don't think so, because they could have easily have put a stop to it;
                    they could have easily identified us. In those days we certainly had a number of
                    security options at our disposal, but nothing like we have today and the Indian
                    government could have penetrated us immediately and probably had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were both basically working the same side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: That's right. No objections. I don't recall being harassed by the
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Indian army do when it was brought down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It won the war. After all most of the people who were fighting that war
                    were dirt poor, there were no weapons, nothing much could be done. It wasn't
                    like today's arms or rebellions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, at the time India was just beginning to put itself
                        together, wasn't it? You had the princely states, which were still
                        quasi-independent or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes. They were going out of fashion and weren't happy about it; so you
                    had that, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find society in Madras as compared to the
                        society in Madrid in Europe in your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Madras was a peculiar place, everybody was super intellectual.
                    Everybody's family has children who must be artists or in some way prove that
                    they are better than the family that lives next door. Well, the result is they
                    all have to play a musical instrument, dance or Indian dancing or classical
                    Indian dancing. When a girl is about thirteen or fourteen she has to do a sort
                    of coming out, a debut. So, they hire a hall, they put her on the stage with an
                    orchestra and she has to do about four hours of classical dancing. You think it
                    is tough on her; it's also tough on the backsides of those people who are called
                    in to witness this. Anyhow, you went to dinner and just about as the dinner was
                    ending somebody would say, oh, my sister is here and she plays the vina and we
                    were treated to a concert of about three hours of vina music. They're all
                    talented. It's not to say they didn't dance well or play well, but ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying you found that the hand of Washington or
                        even in New Delhi in your point of view your superiors rested lightly on
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Very lightly, yes. We were concerned with other things. World communism
                    was in fashion and we had other fish to fry. We were in the middle of Bombay
                    then came along Korea. Korea came in 1950 and so the real attention was on
                    Korea, not what was going on in Bombay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But wasn't there a concern because the Indians were
                        beginning to play a nasty role. I mean this was when the Indians began with
                        Krishna Menon. I mean, all of a sudden, the Indians weren't really the nice
                        guys. They were a problem. They were a burr under the saddle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: They sure were. Krishna Menon and the United Nations? We really hated
                    them. Colonialism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was basically a British socialist snob in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: He was under the anti-colonist credentials. So, I'm sure he and Kwame
                    Nkrumah got on very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this affect your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Not really. Most Indians with whom we had contact, they enjoyed the
                    prestige of having contacts with somebody in the consulate and even more so in
                    Delhi in the Embassy. They looked forward to those contacts. They, as a matter
                    of fact, they referred to their own people as Buddhist people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Madras, did you see any problem with
                        Tamil separatism or connections with at that time called Ceylon; later it
                        was Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No. That hadn't come up yet. As far as their own aspirations went, all of
                    the southern Indians have a literature that goes deeper and earlier than the
                    Sanskrit literature of the north. You have writings in Talaygoo, Malayan. All of
                    those have a literary history that is four thousand years old, not to mention
                    Bengal. Bengalis think they have it all, too. So, these are people that are very
                    concerned about the past and their own glory. We have that all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Madras when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '51 I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, I was sent to Ceylon or Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from '51 to ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It was one year, '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Ceylon in '51 and
                        '52?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, there again I was under cover as labor reporting officer. That was a
                    new thing that they had invented at the time instead of having a labor attach�
                    in the Embassy, which you couldn't afford because there weren't that many
                    people, you just assigned one of your low-level guys as labor reporting officer.
                    That gave me access to what was a very important labor movement in Ceylon. They
                    had five distinct labor organizations one of which was Trotskyite, the only
                    Trotskyite as far as I know, and run by a very clever man. The reporting of that
                    was eaten up by the Department of Labor. They loved to know about what was going
                    on in Ceylon.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, was that pretty much what you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, I had relations with the police and I would go occasionally to Joffna
                    in the north of the island because they were always hacking down telephone poles
                    and other nasty things. Oh, yes, they had a communist party, which I was
                    watching, too. That was our principal interest in those days. Watch those
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Tamil movement, how did that stand at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: The husband of Bandaranaike, Solomon Ward Bandaranaike, he was, when I
                    was there, he was running a newspaper called Sengalalay, which means Sinhalese
                    blood and he was declaiming against the Indians. What are they doing here,
                    they're taking our money. The Indians worked the tea plantations. The tea
                    plantations are situated on hills and the tea picker had a huge bag about the
                    size of this table or longer and he has to fill that with two leaves on a bud
                    from each plant. Each day you'll get another blossom, two leaves and a bud. That
                    is broken orange pekoe and it goes in the bag. You don't put in any single
                    leaves or single buds in. It has to be quite vigorously gotten. Now, for filling
                    a bag like that, means being almost bent over vertical getting your bag back to
                    the tea factory, they will pay one rupee a day. A rupee that was about thirty
                    cents. This money, many of them sent back to India to support their families
                    there for there were no jobs in India.</p>
                <p>Well, this was, in brief, that they were sending all this good Sinhalese money
                    back to India so they should get rid of these guys. Sinhalese wouldn't take on
                    any tea-picking job. They were basically happy go lucky and it's a country where
                    if you take a banana seed, you go like, and that you've got to duck because of
                    the banana tree. Now, at any rate, he was one, he started a great deal of animus
                    against the Indian workers. As a matter of fact he was shot in 1953 or 1954,
                    shortly after I left, by some people who thought he hadn't gone far enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I mean how did you find sort of getting on in society
                        there? Did all sit around and talk about how awful the Tamils were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, no. My wife had a Tamil obstetrician as a matter of fact. No,
                    they were well considered when we were there. People liked them. This was only
                    the tea pickers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the unions? I mean I take it there wasn't a tea
                        pickers' union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No. As far as I can remember I don't think there was one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the union? Were they sort of imbued with the
                        class struggle as taught by northern school of economics and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No they weren't that far educated. They paid their dues and they looked
                    to the union to do something for them politically, but I can't imagine that any
                    of them had any real notions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess our only interest there in a way was the Chinese
                        or the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I was not interested in the Chinese or the Soviets there, or I was not
                    directed in that or not in that direction. Most of the time I was in India, I
                    think the Embassy in Delhi possibly had people who were directed in that, but

                <p>IMBREY: 1953.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I was there until 1956, so that's three years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I was named communist party officer for NEA and my duty was to encourage
                    all of the countries in the Near Eastern/African Division to pay more attention
                    to communism and report on communism and develop agents abroad who could report
                    on communism in their respective countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, particularly in the Middle Eastern side, where the
                        Arab nationalists were making nice to the Soviet Union, they weren't making
                        nice to indigenous communist parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, but our instructions were to develop agents within the communist
                    party and report on their intentions and relationships with the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you would have to be a little circumspect in
                        this, but a lot of time has passed. In the first place, how effective do you
                        think we were in developing agents dealing with getting reports of all
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I think we were quite effective. We had, my specialty, of course, having
                    been in India, I did pay more attention to the Indian communist parties than I
                    would to the others, but we developed good sources within the government and the
                    communist parties themselves of India, Pakistan; Afghanistan wasn't a problem in
                    those days. What they did with communism was exactly what we'd like to do with
                    them. In Iran, their Tudeh party, we were very much involved in that as you
                    could imagine. We regarded it as a big menace and worked very hard to destroy
                    the relationships between the Tudeh and the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you destroy relationships? I mean, you know, I'm
                        sitting back in Washington and I press a button and say to destroy, but what
                        does this mean?</hi>

                <p>IMBREY: Well, we had Kermit Roosevelt out there, who was a very charismatic man.
                    His able assistant John Waller. Waller had the wrestlers' association and I
                    can't exactly remember how he got in bed with them, but he was able to get the
                    wrestlers out onto the street and whatever the wrestlers wanted to do, the
                    country wanted to do. They're so involved in wrestling in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There and in Turkey. You don't want to mess with
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: They exert a great deal of influence and if they told the communists that
                    that was not a good thing for the country, the people followed the wrestlers.
                    That was one of the operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about when you moved over to the Arab world, did you
                        feel, you know, I'm speaking of Syria and Egypt, one has the feeling that
                        Arab nationalism and communism didn't work very well together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: We did our best to encourage Islamic parties in those days. That was
                    before there was a great rivalry between Shias and Sunnis that developed after
                    the Iranian experience. But in those days one could get to these people and
                    actively organize against communism, certainly in Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The communist parties in various countries have different
                        ways. The American communist party was apparently a real toady to the Soviet
                        Union and the French communist party was, too, but then you start moving
                        over to the British and Italian, German and all and there was some distance
                        between.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, and dare and glare in the '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was much later yes. During this time how, and
                        we're talking about the NEA area, were the communist parties like the Tudeh
                        and the ones in India and Pakistan complete tools of the Soviet Union or was
                        there some distance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, it depended on the rivalry between the Maoists and the Soviets.
                    That became very important especially in India. You had two rival parties, one
                    which was obedient, really, to the Soviet Union and the other in the southwest,
                    who were very favored to the Chinese. So, you had two different groups
                    struggling and they did not like each other one bit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get into the disinformation side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, you bet we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People were howling saying “Did you hear what so and so's
                        doing?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Of course as soon as you hear of a rivalry like this, that is a way of
                    getting answers. So, we certainly did that. In India, of course, there are so
                    many other groups, casts, religions. For example in the Kerala region where the
                    Chinese communists were Maoists were important. There were also the Syrian
                    Christians. They [word indistinct] Jews in Jew town, Maccabean Jews who had come
                    over in the 2nd century B.C. They were still an important group there. So you
                    had all sorts of groups you could call on to get into business with you. Plus a
                    tremendously educated class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In India and Pakistan were they going through the normal
                        thing, kids in college, were communists taking kids out of college who
                        immediately became disaffected with the establishment. I mean was that the
                        pattern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: It certainly was and one of the patterns was, if they had gone to school
                    in America, they came back very pro-communist. If they went to school in the
                    Soviet Union they came back very pro-American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any great crises or incidents you can think of
                        during this particular period? It was the time of the Suez War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: There was that and the outbreak of the Korean War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was around 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: But, no I don't think of a period in the mid-'50s where there was any
                    great crisis. It was sort of a mundane job; I just had to go around lecturing
                    and encouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering in the agency at that time was there a
                        pretty strong wall between what you were doing and that in the clandestine

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: That was the clandestine side.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you were on the clandestine side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, yes, there was a war between the clandestine side and the
                    intelligence side and that persisted for a long time. They were not permitted to
                    know our operations and so we were not permitted to tell them and the result was
                    they had to judge the information through a series of fences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, it was sort of a check. In other words
                        they were looking at more objectively than hearing from the operators who
                        had maybe exaggerated claims of success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, that's true in one sense. In another, I ran into the same thing
                    myself when I was running one agent in India and I found out that the agency was
                    correcting information from the same agent and that turned out to be an agent of
                    James J. Angleton and I asked his staff to help me out and tell me what was
                    going on. They said no way we're not telling you anything about our
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was a great spymaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, he was and he also was fully in charge and the only one in charge of
                    the Israeli operations or the operations involving the Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all feel that the Israelis were playing really on
                        the same side with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, we were deeply in bed with the Israelis and I think we would have
                    known any deception on their part.</p>
                <p>Q: Because I've always had the suspicion that the Israelis had to play somewhat
                    of a double game because they had interests in the Soviet Union. They had stakes
                    and needed a certain amount of cooperation in order to get Jews out of the
                    country and the KGB or whatever it is was willing to play this game to a certain
                    extent.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, we were right into Moscow and I can't believe that they would have
                    attempted a deception when they were getting an enormous part of their revenue
                    from American aid.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: No, I don't really think so and I certainly don't know of any, in that

                    all the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, sure. That certainly occurred. Oh yes. You're dealing with penal
                    people. They get money from both sides, yes.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: In '56 I was relieved from that post, thank God, and sent to Addis
                    Ababa.</p>
                <p>

                <p>Q: What was the situation in Ethiopia at the time?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Life was never easy. The emperor was fully in charge. We liked him and in
                    our terms in our country he was pretty good. The revenue that he got from the
                    people was under his care when almost 90 percent were educated and so we had no
                    quarrel with the emperor except the fact that he was always asking for more
                    money and airplanes. Joe Simonson was the ambassador and was made ambassador
                    because Eisenhower was under the impression that Ethiopia was a theocracy and
                    that he should send a reverend. Simonson was a minister and he opened every
                    meeting in the embassy “In the name of Jesus Christ, the elder brother of the
                    human race, let not the emperor ask me again for a constitution airplane.” But,
                    it was a constellation airplane. He wanted desperately a constellation
                    airplane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, beautiful planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, I loved them. But, at any rate, it was a relatively calm and peaceful
                    country. There were always sideline attempts by the military to get an
                    advantage. Only one important one and that occurred after I left.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: That was a thorny issue and the reason for that was in 1954 the United
                    Nations in their wisdom or the wisdom of four delegates that they sent to map
                    out the situation decided that the Eritrea issue should be under the Ethiopians
                    for military and foreign affairs but otherwise have a certain amount of freedom.
                    This never worked as far as the Ethiopians were concerned.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: Yes, indeed we had Kagnew Station and we also had a camp there that
                    contained enough beds, bedding and equipment to house all the people who might
                    eventually be driven out of the Middle East in the event of a serious conflict.
                    I forget the name of that camp, but I visited it a number of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was all part of the evacuation system. During this time
                        you were there I was in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and that was kind of where our
                        safe haven was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, you were. But then if you were air lifted out of Tehran then you were
                    gone to Eritrea to this particular camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How about relations with Somalia at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: At the time there were no relations. They got along and I don't think
                    there was any difficulty between the two countries to speak of .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't having a war over the Ogaden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, they weren't having a war. What was happening there all the time
                    was tribal movements and disturbances at just about every time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there are nomads going back and forth across that
                        Ogaden Desert. Were you involved in the long-term question of who was going
                        to succeed Haile Selassie?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>IMBREY: No, that was pretty well taken care of. He had two sons who were
                    eligible. One of them was killed in an automobile crash while we were there.
                    Then the crown prince was the obvious selection to be the ruler. We got along
                    with the crown prince just fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, were we messing around there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, yes, we had operations, but there again they were against the
                    Russians, against their acolytes. We had the first really important telephone
                    operation. This was before that great thing in the tunnel in Berlin. We had a
                    very big operation, as a matter of fact, we had bugs on the Soviets, Czechs,
                    Egyptians and I think a Bulgarian came in. I can't feel that it was a high
                    priority. In the Embassy there was a wing which was known by the locals as the
                    CIA wing. In the basement we had many tape recorders and a number of people
                    spent the entire day translating from the various take on these things. We had a
                    house rather far out in which the tape recorders were running night and day
                    causing a great deal of problems for us because we have to explain the high bill
                    for electricity, which we did by getting somebody in the telephone company to
                    ignore it. But then the problem was the heat that was generated by these things
                    and we had to go out and buy more fans all the time. The fans didn't work, the
                    electricity didn't work and everything didn't work as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>Then another thing, we had a central place where the telephone lines were
                    connected to our apparatus. This was about four feet underground and we built in
                    the house of a former agent, we built a garage around it to make it appear as if
                    it were a garage and then we buried this stuff. Well, about every four or five
                    months they would decide to extend the telephone lines which would mean we'd
                    have to go there, unbury the lines, put them near the surface so that they would
                    find them, but they wouldn't find our bugs and to do that you have to get
                    through Ethiopian mud which sticks like a [word indistinct]. It was a six-hour
                    job getting this stuff to the surface and then getting it back in until we all
                    hated it, but it was a successful operation, except that the people never said
                    anything much over the phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, were the Soviets very successful in
                        Ethiopia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, they didn't have much success. They made friends and I don't
                    think they convinced anybody. There was no communist party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later in the '70s you had Haile Selassie overthrown and
                        the Mengistu government came in they were talking Marxist, but I think they
                        were sort of home grown, weren't they? They weren't Soviet agents
                        particularly.</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>IMBREY: The Soviets were playing their own game and the Soviet game at that time
                    was to get to the Red Sea. Now they had been to Somalia, which is on the Indian
                    Ocean. All of a sudden they drop Somalia totally and made friends with the
                    Ethiopians. People, most journalists, will tell you that's when the Americans
                    moved in on the Somalis to take up the slack with the departure of the Russians.
                    That was totally untrue. We never got into Somalia because the president,
                    despite the fact the Russians deserted, was still communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Siad Barre?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, Siad Barre. Siad Barre said go to Valista [as heard], communists
                    didn't want anything to do with the Americans and it was only years later that
                    we had somewhat of an arrangement with his intelligence organization. But it
                    didn't make any difference; Somalia was such a backwater that we were not about
                    to spend lots of money doing anything with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, my understanding was our foreign policy was almost
                        revolved around Kagnew Station and keeping Kagnew Station?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, and then when that became a liability they moved it to Liberia, God
                    bless them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '58 what was your rank, title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Let's see I was a GS-15 at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you calling yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Attach� at the Embassy. Attach� of what? You know we had this big problem
                    between the two brothers, between the two Dulleses. That lasted after both had
                    departed. They did not want us confused with the Foreign Service and so we were
                    always registered as FSR, where everybody looked down the list and spotted us
                    right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '58 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>IMBREY: They had a new plan. Africa was emerging. As of '58 I think there were
                    four independent African countries, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. In
                    their brief year or two after that, and we saw this all coming, there was
                    independence for all of the African regions and we knew we had to get in there
                    before the Soviets. So, they told us to go outside the agency, develop a
                    business, and work at the United Nations in getting sources there and see what
                    we could do. Well, I started a public relations office in New York a couple of
                    blocks from the United Nations and spent most of my time at the UN visiting
                    Africans and encouraging them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '58 to '63, but in '60 the whole thing changed because they sent me out.
                    I guess it was in April and May of 1960 I was sent to Leopoldville to help out
                    with the station, developing sources for the oncoming independence of the Congo
                    and I did all sorts of jobs along with the chief of station and a couple of
                    other guys. One of my people was Al Canharogey, who was to play a larger part
                    with the Baluba element, and Cyrille Adoula who became the prime minister, later
                    and a number of other people, passing money most of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would be very hard to sort of identify
                        because the Belgians really hadn't done much to develop a political class,
                        had they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: They didn't, but the White Fathers had graduated at least maybe 480 more
                    licentiates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High school graduates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, better than that. That's why I was hesitating. There were sharp young
                    men and we were dealing with as many of those as we could. A year later, you may
                    recall a sequence of events that happened in the Congo. After Lumumba was
                    killed, the government became a government of commissars. There were twelve
                    commissars who were under the aegis of a chief commissar, who was Adoula, and
                    all the commissars were young men who had some university experience or at least
                    some experience under the White Fathers. So, they were a pretty classy set. They
                    could write, they could do a lot of things. So, we're dealing with all of these
                    people and passing out a lot of pittances. It wasn't a lot of money. We were
                    passing out money to enable them to form their political cadres and get around
                    the country and talk. Now getting around the country in those days was not
                    terribly difficult because the Belgians had made an infrastructure that was
                    unbelievable between the river traffic and the road traffic of at least 50,000
                    miles of paved roads.</p>

                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing from '59 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: From '59 to '60, and then shortly after independence I went home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Came back to New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Came back to New York. There was a fight between President Kasavubu and
                    Lumumba. Lumumba was prime minister, Kasavubu the president. Each one could seek
                    a delegation at the United Nations, but there could only be one delegation; they
                    both had the right to seek it. Now, we figured that if Kasavubu seated his
                    delegation at the United Nations it would be a pro-American one and if Lumumba
                    seated his, God knows what it would be. So, Ambassador Timberlake, who is very
                    good friend of mine, Clare Timberlake had been the best man at my wedding in
                    Bombay and we were old, old friends. He knew that I had this public relations
                    office and he asked if I would take on the job of taking on Kasavubu, which I
                    would get paid for by my organization and the expenses would be met. So, I
                    agreed to do that and they sent over Kasavubu and with a little bit of
                    engineering we got Kasavubu into the United Nations and seated his delegation
                    even though Lumumba was there trying to make a big pitch for his
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you work this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, we knew the people in the delegations and we had on our side
                    Morocco and a number of heavy hitters, France, England. It just was a matter of
                    explanation getting their support for the Congo delegation under Kasavubu and we
                    heralded non-communist delegations and at any rate we got him in. Then Kasavubu
                    went home. I was named public relations counselor through the government of the
                    Congo. A very nice title you see. So, they began calling on me, they said,
                    “Well, we're having trouble in Zambia, why don't you go there and tell them what
                    it's all about. We're having trouble in West Africa.” Well, I went to every
                    country in Africa, explaining what the Congo was up to and that took at least
                    two or three years out of my life. I was all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy. Well, this was a particularly difficult period
                        because Lumumba was killed; you had the break away with Katanga. Were you
                        there during the Simbas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: In and out.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, it was terrible. I learned one thing. Don't wear a wristwatch.
                    Anytime a soldier saw you with a wristwatch, he would say, “Is that your
                    wristwatch?” and you'd better say, “No, I think it's yours.” An officer got hit
                    over the head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with these people? Was it completely
                        denial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, it wasn't at all because they had their own interests at heart
                    and they had so much money in that place at the time. Not only the Belgians, the
                    various going concerns. When you have the huge mining industry that is there,
                    money is tumbling in every direction and so all these people were playing for
                    the big money. Now the Congo had diamonds, copper, uranium, even the river
                    traffic that carries the boats, everything produced money.</p>
                <p>So, also the infrastructure the Belgians had devised. I can only explain it this
                    way. They had to have a work force for Katanga to exploit the mines there. This
                    was back around the 1920s and they found that there was only one group they
                    could depend on to pick up something off the ground and not drop it because the
                    Africans had very little prehensile training as children. They don't have toys,
                    but there was one group, the Baluba. The Balubas are in the mid-section of the
                    country. They imported all of the Baluba and made them the Balubas of the
                    Katanga. That started a number of problems, but they also built houses for all
                    of these people, lovely beautiful houses with water every other house. The women
                    could go to the spigot and fill a bucket. Then they needed coal for the mines;
                    they built the colliery, which produced coal. They need pharmaceuticals; they
                    built their own pharmaceutics. All of these are money producers. So, they
                    weren't looking for us for their small change, they were looking for the big
                    stuff, the president of a colliery.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: We certainly knew a number of the Belgians and cooperated with them

                    compound to chief of station Larry Devlin and he sent it back with an angry note
                    saying, “Don't you know the Belgians are going to kill him, what do you want us
                    to do?” We kept totally out of that one. Then Lumumba really put himself in
                    terrible trouble when he gave a rise of one rank to everybody in the army and
                    then found he couldn't pay the new prices. Then the army rebelled; they put him
                    in an airplane, took him south and they pulled him out of the airplane on the
                    driveway, brought him up to the chief of the Lunda tribe and in Munongo's office
                    and I guess they shot him there or it may not have been there. In Munongo's
                    office they began asking him a couple of questions. Well, this was according to
                    his answers. Munongo took a bayonet and put it right into Lumumba's chest and
                    Captain Gatt, a Belgian, was right there and he fired a bullet in the back of
                    Lumumba's head to put him out of his misery and that was how it happened, but no
                    Americans were involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No. That was about '62 or '63. I was in and out of the Congo in various
                    countries, but I wasn't involved with the Embassy at all or with our
                    station.</p>

                <p>IMBREY: Public relations handler with an office in New York and tired feet in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding other surrounding African countries sort
                        of looking upon the dismemberment of the Congo or not, hoping to get
                        something from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, they didn't have a care for the Congo; they had their own troubles.
                    Let's see I was in Guinea, Mali, and Ivory Coast, well all of them in French
                    West Africa.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the Congo Brazzaville, was that sort of out of bounds?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, they were having their own revolution there and not terribly much to
                    be done. You have to understand the situation. They had people up in Fort
                    Rousset which is in the middle of the country where different tribes are the
                    ones along the Congo River and the Fort Rousset people eventually did take
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Embassy going in one direction and the station

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, no, the station and the Embassy were very close. In Brazzaville we
                    didn't have a representative. Al Lukens was the chief there and he reported I
                    guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Tshombe and the Katanga situation. What
                        were our concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Our concerns were that the country should not be divided into two
                    different countries, which was what Tshombe really wanted. He wanted separatism
                    for Katanga and we regarded that as a misery for the entire country, for they
                    were so dependent on the mining revenues from Katanga, and so the fight really
                    was against separation. We supported the central government. The central
                    government was then run by Adoula and was very adamant against Tshombe. Lumumba
                    had already disappeared from the scene and then Kasavubu was never a terribly
                    important character, just wishy, washy. A chap we followed was named Josef Laho
                    [as heard] who I think was demented. It was very hard for us to find any
                    reliable people. Our principal helpmates were Justin Bomboko with the minister
                    of foreign affairs and the head of the service. Those two really fought to keep
                    the country together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still playing the UN connection when you went
                        back? Did you go back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, and the UN connection in the Congo, remember was under an Indian
                    general. Everybody hated him. I can't think of his name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Indian general came one of the people I have
                        interviewed, Terry McNamara, said they loved him because he didn't take any
                        crap from anybody. His troops were disciplined and the Indians were
                        disciplined troops compared to some of the others. I actually recall some
                        accounts of some Italian troops being captured and eaten.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, I was in hotels and dealing with the people the best we could and
                    passing out money.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Q: I would think the agency would have a real problem in handing out money
                    because they can always say, “Well I got somebody and he wants $20,000” and
                    actually you've made a deal with $10,000 or something. I would think handing out
                    money is, you know, is an accountant's nightmare.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: We did have the box and I'm very susceptible to the box, the lie
                    detector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Oh, I got you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I'm very susceptible. All I do is think of a time that I [words
                    indistinct] whatever I was thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. I would feel the same way. I felt guilty
                        when I was in the air force and they would line us up and say, “Who did
                        this” and I would always have to stop myself from stepping out there even
                        though I hadn't had a thing to do with anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, I assure you that if I had been careless with the funds I couldn't
                    have gotten away with it. I've been told that there are people who have lied
                    successfully and defeated the lie detector, but I don't think there are many of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anyone else or were you a sole proprietor of
                        this public relations place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, I had another young man along with me who was a junior and I still
                    correspond with him occasionally after these many years. He was not gifted. I
                    had languages and so in Somalia I could speak Italian, in French West Africa, I
                    could speak French and that's what I speak in [word indistinct]. So, you know I
                    get along with my colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you were doing that until '63 and then what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, they sent me to Paris, where again I was undercover with a news
                    firm. Since then, '63, when a law was enacted which forbade us from using a news
                    organization as a cover. In those days it wasn't forbidden. So worldwide
                    information services was doing commercial public relations all over the world
                    and they got me a post as its representative in Europe, stationed in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>IMBREY: I was handling all the many, many African agents. Now, try to meet an
                    African on the streets; everybody in Africa, white and black, played their own
                    role. But, if a black happens to be passing through Paris one can get at him in
                    a cafe, a movie, wherever you like and nobody thinks anything of it. So, I was
                    handling about ten to fourteen agents regularly from various parts. If anybody
                    had a problem seeing an agent they sent them to Paris and I would debrief them.
                    That was my role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paris was sort of the mecca for so many people in Africa
                        anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, yes, all the French West Africans regularly came to Paris anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the French? I mean did the
                        French know what you were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: They probably did. I guess I can't be too naive about that, but they
                    never bothered me, they never talked to me about it. Incidentally, I had French
                    friends who knew me in Bombay, or even Addis Ababa. They knew I was CIA and they
                    could have easily have told the government and they may have.</p>
                <p>Q: I mean, basically, were you sort of under constraints to keep it to
                    Africans?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Not really, I had one very good agent, he was a Frenchman, but he was
                    also very interested in Africa. Let's see, he was the head of a Christian
                    organization that worked with students in French West Africa and I saw him
                    regularly and I contributed to his program. So, nobody raised any problems. He
                    himself was not particularly unhappy about the arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was a time when France was going through a
                        period of fairly strong nationalism with De Gaulle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Right, and that was the time that Guinea said no to De Gaulle, where
                    everybody else said yes. So, we were dealing with all the yes countries and not
                    much to do with Guinea. I did, of course, have agents in Guinea that I was
                    seeing regularly. But the French would have approved of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do, just get reports and keep in
                        touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, no, again this was all against the Soviets. Most of the agents that
                    had been developed in these various countries were watching what the Soviets
                    were doing in shipping, penetrating the national organizations. This was the era
                    of mass organizations. Do you remember that? The youth, the WFBY, all these mass
                    organizations, and the Russians were playing a heavy hand developing agents and
                    contacts in those mass organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: We were, too.</p>
                <p>Q: At this stage it almost feels like if the FBI hadn't been around the communist
                    party of the United States might have collapsed?</p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, there was something like that, yes. We didn't have that many. After
                    a while Africa was never a great priority and certainly not at the time of
                    Kissinger. I went to a lecture by Kissinger at the War Department and some young
                    officer asked him a question. He said, “Dr. Kissinger, which is one of the
                    important countries as far as American policy goes?” and he said, “India is
                    important, Pakistan is important”, and he went around to France and somebody
                    finally piped up and said, “What about Africa?” and he said, “No, not
                    important.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets have a plan or was this just general
                        mischief making or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Sure. They were out to use the mass organizations to get them out on the
                    streets in various countries of the world. Prague was the head of the WFBY for
                    example, and they had a lot of people going to Prague to get the people out in
                    the streets in support of the Soviet policies in Czechoslovakia and you know the
                    Americans went there and ruined it for them at one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our concern in those days was mass movements and that sort
                        of thing. We're not really talking about the terrorists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, mass organizations were very important and then Sukarno started the
                    third world operation. What was that called? The nonaligned.</p>

                <p>Q: Were the Soviets putting considerable amount of money and effort into

                    Paris.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: My wife did not mind a bit. She had a background in France. She speaks
                    good French, so she enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '66 what did they do to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, I'm trying to think of the reason why. I moved to Belgium. Let's see,
                    what had happened. Oh, yes. One of my agents was caught in Geneva by the Swiss
                    police and they had a book, a memorandum he had been keeping which had my name
                    in it and a couple of other notations and so the chief of station in Geneva
                    wrote to headquarters, saying that I had been compromised, that the French would
                    know of my goings on immediately. This was an agent the French were interested
                    in. So, they suggested that I get out of there before the French threw me out.
                    So, the agency said, “Okay” and we moved to Brussels. I was very annoyed because
                    I didn't think really that that would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, as you say they probably had a pretty good fix on
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, yes. I don't know what happened, but anyway I went to Brussels.
                    Picked up the family, got this nice place there and just told all the agents
                    from now on meet me in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there from '66 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were essentially doing the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, doing exactly the same thing and then in '67 something similar
                    happened and I don't remember what it was, but anyway we had to move to
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in Rome from '67 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '67 to '68. Now, when I moved to Rome, I did the same thing with meeting
                    these guys in Rome instead of Paris or Brussels, and in Rome I fixed myself up
                    nicely. I got a nice office, represented my firm and had a good backup story of
                    why my firm had to move me, which was logical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still worldwide ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Worldwide information services, yes. The cover held fine. There were
                    reasons; I can go into if you ever want to. The chief of station in Rome was
                    very exercised. He said, “You moved into Rome and I was not told anything about
                    it or gave my permission for it.” Then he said, “You're using up too much of my
                    station's time.” I had something like ten or twelve, maybe more, agents. Each
                    time they would come they would give me a report. In those days I would take the
                    report, digest it, type out my own report and hand it to a contact in the
                    Embassy. He would then bring it back and they had to retype it onto official
                    stationery or prepare it for a cable and that was taking up a lot of his time.
                    Here I was calling the guy every fifteen minutes; come on over I got something
                    for you. So, the chief of station was very annoyed. He said, “I didn't mind when
                    you came in here, but when I see the amount of work it's causing us I don't have
                    the people to handle it, so get the hell out of here.” So, I was sent home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't build up your staff; could they have built up
                        your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, you know all those things take a good deal of planning and money
                    and decision and also good communications. My boss was Archie Roosevelt who was
                    a very nice guy, but on the other hand, not too quick to act. So, we came home
                    and I stayed home until my next post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came home what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: That's where we turn off the tape recorder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well then, we'll just skip over that. When did
                        you take off again where we can talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Let's see. I was sent back to Rome in '72. Turn it off for a while and
                    I'll tell you about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What should we talk about, the elections in Italy? You
                        were in Rome from '72 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: '72 to '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been in the papers that the Christian Democrats were
                        gaining an awful lot, I mean really since '48 anyway, the big election. So,
                        who was going to spend more money, the Soviets or the Americans? What were
                        you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Well, remember, let's see around '50 I think it was when this great thing
                    that they had, a program where they had all the Americans of Italian ancestry
                    writing to their relatives in Italy to vote Christian Democrat. That was one of
                    the great successful ploys of all time. At any rate, we supported the Christian
                    Democrats for years and the money was not ill spent. It didn't go into peoples'
                    pockets. It went into across the roads, and banners and parades and all sorts of
                    things, but it was highly successful. We kept the communists down to about 37%
                    or 38% of the vote and the Christian Democrats always won. So, here's '72 and
                    there are new problems on all sides and the communists are making good headway
                    and we got in there with a lot of money. I think we had a couple of million
                    dollars for this.</p>
                <p>Then came our fight with Graham Martin, who was the ambassador at the time.
                    Martin said, “That money is for me and I will spend it any way I like.” Our
                    chief of station said, “No, the CIA is supposed to deal out the money” and
                    Graham said, “No, you deal it out and I'll tell you who to give it to.” Well, he
                    chose a man named Lorenzo Decarrorechi, who was the head of the secret police in
                    Rome. He and Lorenzo were great friends and Lorenzo was a great friend of ours,
                    too, but was the wrong guy to give the money to in our estimation and we were
                    very unhappy. At any rate we used the money the way Graham Martin wanted us to
                    use it and the result was stupendous. For the first time I think we got the
                    communist vote down by about 3% and the Christian Democrats ahead by about 4%
                    and this was a tremendous victory. It took a great deal of running around and
                    doing all sorts of peculiar work of the kind that I'd been doing before,
                    undermining and having fun and games, but we did it. Then after that I was
                    developing agents in newspapers and other literary elements writing came out a
                    number of types of operations that I had done in the past in this case all to
                    undermine the Soviet position in Italy. In Africa as well. I was again with my
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were up against a change. You were beginning to get
                        Euro-communism, and certainly presentable in public compared to some of the
                        thugs that had risen out of the regular communist parties. Were you able to
                        do much with the communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Oh, yes, we had agents in the trade unions, which were very important in
                    Italy. The Catholic union we supported. They got plenty of help from the
                    Catholics, but from other countries. We had our people in there. Youth
                    organizations and at the time that they were developing the super communist
                    parties, the terrorist gangs.</p>
                <p>Q: The red brigades, primolina, some of those.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: There were a couple of others that were publishing every day. We did what
                    we could to discourage them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were much harder to penetrate, weren't they, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>IMBREY: No, no, we had sufficient penetration of them and we had a battalion of
                    people who really could do that sort of thing very easily. After all if you tell
                    the trade unions what you want them to do they have somebody who will do it and
                    we did have people high up in the trade unions who could do practically
                    anything. I think there were at least five principal labor union organizations
                    in Italy on whom we could count.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember all the alphabet soup of them. Was this
                        in cooperation with the Italian authorities or did we do our thing and they
                        did their thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: I imagine the Italians had a pretty good idea of what was going on. We
                    didn't tell them who our agents were and I imagine they handed us a number of
                    agents, but we never knew whether we could trust what they handed us. As I was
                    saying, Lorenzo Federico, who was the principal friend of Graham Martin
                    eventually tried to lead a coup d'etat. This was a famous one where they got
                    police officers that work in the provinces and they had a march on Rome and the
                    dumb bastards stop for a traffic light for just long enough for the forces of
                    the government to turn them back. At any rate, Lorenzo went to jail, I think, or
                    maybe paid his way out, who knows.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you involved with this organization, under the Coladeus thing? From what
                    I understand we had had this in some places, this sort of a stay-behind. If the
                    Soviet army took over Italy we had arms and people ready to run guerrilla
                    movements and all of that.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: I have heard of that, but I have never had any experience with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Vatican, did you get involved with the
                        Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Let's see. I had one source who worked for the newspaper, Osservatore
                    Romano. That was all. He was an astute observer and so I got a lot of hints from
                    him, which was not what you would call a penetration of the Vatican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself concentrating pretty much in the
                        north of Italy? What about the Mezzogiorno?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, we did very little in Mezzogiorno. As a matter of fact, we knew
                    Johnny Agnelli well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, he's up in Torino.</hi>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Let me tell you, we did not like him for what he did to us. Son of a
                    bitch. Let's see, around 1973 or '74 there came out this publication, Who is the
                    CIA. Do you remember that one? It was a Czech publication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Who's Who in the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: There were two of them. There was the one that was provided by the East
                    Germans; the Cubans were actually the ones who got the information. They got it
                    from our defector.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, they got some stuff kind of wrong because the publication Who's Who in
                    the CIA, I thumbed through that thing to see who I knew and there I was and I
                    had never been in the CIA.</p>
                <p>IMBREY: No, they had Eisenhower in that one. This was the second one, the one
                    after that. I know that the information came from Agee and he knew who these
                    guys were and somebody like Eisenhower, he said forget it. So, they had the
                    right guys. The thing came out all over Italy and all of a sudden La Stampa
                    published all the names of the guys who were in Italy, giving their home
                    addresses, which was a little bit more than needed. We were furious about that
                    and so one of our friends knew a lot of society people in New York with whom
                    Agnelli hung out, so he told them the story. Agnelli went to New York and nobody
                    would see him and so he got the message, but after that we were all taking
                    different routes to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were doing this until '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: After '76 I went back to headquarters for two years and then retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then maybe we can finish it off.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>IMBREY: Yes, very likely because in the two years there I was known really for
                    covert operations and the type of operations people didn't know what the hell
                    they were talking about. They said, “This is fun and games and cushy work and we
                    don't do that sort of thing anymore. We're just like the chap who said gentlemen
                    don't spy on other gentlemen. We don't stoop to doing these things.” I really
                    had very little to do for those two years. We tried a number of operations and
                    they were shot down by the State Department most of the time. There's another
                    thing that happened. In order to get a covert operation off, the covert
                    operation got designed by the CIA upon the basis of a report by the State
                    Department that says “this type of activity is in the interest of the United
                    States, do something.”</p>
                <p>The CIA devises the operation and then goes to the National Security Council,
                    which in all its wisdom decides whether this is not only feasible but whether it
                    works for our advantage. If they think it is feasible and like it, they send a
                    finding to the President that it is in the interest of the United States. The
                    President signs the finding. That enables the cash to come for the operation.
                    Without that there's no operation. So, we would work very hard to devise the
                    operation, get the cash in and then read about the operation in the papers the
                    next day, the most secret stuff the government was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Carter administration? Where did you feel it
                        was coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IMBREY: This was sort of endemic, Carter and after. I could give you another
                    couple of examples in the '80s. I'm thinking around 1980 we decided on two
                    operations, one to undermine the Iranians, and the second was to have a radio
                    beaming information to arouse the Iranian people. Both findings were accepted. I
                    did a good deal more work in this particular operation.</p>
