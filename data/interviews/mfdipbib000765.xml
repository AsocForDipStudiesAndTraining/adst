                <p>SENATOR CHARLES MCC. MATHIAS</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 18, 1995</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 18, 1995. This is an interview with
                        Senator Charles (”Mac”) Mathias. This is being done on the behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. We're
                        doing it in Senator Mathias's office in downtown Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Senator, I'm wondering if we could start off a bit by giving a bit about your
                    background: could you tell me when and where you were born and your family?</p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, I was born in Frederick, Maryland on the 24th of July, 1922. My
                    father was a lawyer in Frederick and my mother was a native of Frederick. Her
                    name was Theresa Trail. Both of their families had been Republicans even back
                    during the Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a little difficult in those days...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: It was. Frederick was a rather unique community in those days—it was
                    much more isolated than it is today. It's now really part of suburban
                    Washington, but in those days it was a very rural county seat which was centered
                    on the courthouse and local events. So it was a great place to grow up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My great grandfather marched passed there in late June of
                        1863. He was with the Army of the Potomac. Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Of course, I went to the public schools in Frederick in the early days:
                    I graduated from Frederick High School, then went for a year to the Pawling
                    School in Pawling, New York. Then to Haverford College. The War (World War II)
                    broke out, of course, on December 7th, 1941—that resulted in some abbreviation
                    of my college. I enlisted...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You enlisted in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: I initially enlisted in the Coast Guard. I had tried to join the Navy
                    and they found a heart murmur which disqualified me. But the Coast Guard took me
                    and then I got into some training programs in the Coast Guard which makes a long
                    story, but I ended up in a training program at Yale University which the Coast
                    Guard decided to terminate. At that point I was transferred into the Navy where
                    I had originally tried to go. So I ended up in the Navy in World War II and went
                    to the South Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of duty did you have in the Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I was on an amphibious command ship, which was a AGC, in fact, the US
                    Appalachian, AGC I. We were involved in operations in the Philippines and went
                    into the landing at Lingayen Gulf. Then we went on up to the occupation of
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in Okinawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: No, we were not immediately involved in Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time (our interview is going to be focused on
                        your interest and concern with foreign affairs) did you get a chance to get
                        ashore and see the Philippines and get any feel for this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I saw a great deal of the Philippines, went into Manila when the ashes
                    were still glowing - still smoking from the battle...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was one of the heaviest battles of our entire
                        Pacific campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: To retake Manila and a chance to see what life was like in various parts
                    of the Philippines. And then we got up to Japan we were the first Americans to
                    arrive at the north end of Honshu, so we had the initial experience of landing
                    and making contact with the local Japanese people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ______- Misawa and that area there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Aomori - we had no idea what sort of a reception we would get and we
                    went ashore prepared to have some sort of difficulties if that happened. But
                    there were no difficulties whatever: we were met on the beach by a group of the
                    local elders who were bowing and welcoming. We discovered that they had been as
                    uncertain about us as we had been about them because they had sent all the women
                    and children to the hills. The women and children didn't reappear for several
                    days. Then we went around to Nagasaki and Hiroshima which were awesome
                    experiences because that was a matter of thirty days or so after the bombs had
                    dropped. It still was pretty much exactly as it had been...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern at that time about exposing people
                        to radiation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I don't think we knew enough to be very concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody was running ahead with a Geiger counter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: No, nothing like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just sort of go in and kick the ruins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: There was a lot to see. One thing that I regret that I didn't bring
                    back—I remember stubbing my toe on something and looked down and there was a
                    shiny object. As I looked at it, I realized what it was: it was molten glass.
                    Apparently some Japanese housewife had some glass tumblers sitting on a shelf
                    and the fire ball had been so hot that it melted this glass and fused all of
                    these tumblers together into one lump of glass. It would have been such a
                    striking, visible example of what happens under conditions of atomic bombing
                    that I wish I had brought it back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Try to capture the mood at the time because now it is
                        fifty years after that and historians are playing games of “Should we have
                        dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?”. What were your feelings and,
                        as far as you can gather, your fellow people?Were you an officer at the time
                        or an enlisted man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I was an officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Officer. What was the feeling when the bombs were dropped
                        and after you saw this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, of course, we got the word that the bombs had been dropped when we
                    were still in the Philippines. As I recall, we were anchored in a place called
                    Tata Point off the Island of Leyte... I think that (well, I can only speak for
                    myself), but there was some awareness that something pretty momentous had
                    happened. This was not just another battle. This was something unprecedented and
                    I think we were all aware of that. I had some (I suppose the best way to express
                    it) some reservations. The release of such an awesome power had to give you
                    pause as to whether or not this wasn't (to use a hackneyed phrase) letting the
                    genie out of the bottle. In all of the excitement and with all of the optimism
                    that released because we apparently were going to move forward and still there
                    was this sense of reservation that perhaps this is a pretty drastic thing to
                    have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you been gearing up for the invasion of Japan,
                        thinking about...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We were prepared to go to the invasion, in fact, this was why we were at
                    Taytay Point on Leyte. We were getting shots—inoculation that they thought would
                    be required, we were taking on stores, all the things you do when you are
                    getting ready for a major operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into Japan at the time or were you pretty well
                        stuck on ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: No, we had a rather interesting experience. When we came up from the
                    Philippines to make our initial landing at Aomori in Honshu, the flag officer on
                    our ship was Admiral Connelly (Richard Connelly).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had taken part in the Guadalcanal campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: He was known as “Close-in Connelly”. He was Commander of Amphibious
                    Group V at that time which was scheduled to take part in the landing. After we
                    had landed in Aomori we then went up and occupied Hokkaido. I remember we had
                    sort of a victory banquet at Hakodate—everyone appeared in blue uniforms which
                    was rather unique in that station for the Pacific War. We all sat around on
                    cushions in a Japanese restaurant—this was our first experience. But after we
                    occupied northern Honshu and Hokkaido, Admiral Connelly left the Appalachian and
                    he was succeeded by Admiral Oldendorf who was Combatron I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had led the famous battle at “Cross the T” at Leyte
                        Gulf.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: The last Admiral to “cross the T” at Leyte Gulf. That's right. He had
                    duties around the Japanese coastline and as a result of having these two
                    admirals, we visited a great many of the ports in Japan. That's how we got to
                    Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Finally got to Tokyo—I remember we had anchored in
                    Yokohama and got on a train or tried to get on a train into Tokyo. It was
                    absolutely impossible—it was so packed and jammed, you couldn't get in it. My
                    entry into Tokyo was on the cowcatcher of the locomotive. Sounds rather
                    hazardous today, but at the time it seemed to be the only sensible thing to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to catch again the mood at the time because I
                        think these things are important for posterity and that is here we had been
                        fighting the Japanese, they had attacked us at Pearl Harbor, there had been
                        a lot of propaganda ( a lot of it was sort of racist - “these dirty yellow
                        bastards” and all that... a sneak attack and all.) Here the war was over,
                        and you were coming face to face with them, what was your impression of how
                        the Americans and Japanese got together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Actually, there was very little friction. The initial landing at Aomori
                    was totally peaceful. I suspect that there may have been some pilfering from
                    shops by some soldiers and sailors, but nothing major—no big problem. There were
                    no serious incidents that I remember. It was a fairly peaceful occupation and
                    that was my observation as we traveled around Japan. I remember going into the
                    Diet in Tokyo and there were some sailors who were being amused by sitting
                    themselves on the Emperor Hirohito's throne; but other than that there was no
                    behavior that was disruptive or causing any breach of the peace—anything of that
                    sort. There were a few incidents of that sort, but that was really all it
                    amounted to. Tokyo was pretty quiet and orderly on the part of both the
                    occupying forces and the local population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you involved in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We left Japan, it seems to me, around the end of the year and headed
                    back to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1945?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: In 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We landed in California and I made my way back to the East Coast. I had
                    enough points by that time that I was released from active duty in the spring of
                    1946.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And back to Frederick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Back to Frederick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: As a result of the fact that I had been sent by the Navy to Yale, I had
                    accumulated enough academic credits that I was able to go immediately and enter
                    the University of Maryland Law School. I didn't have to go back to any
                    undergraduate work. So I went to the University of Maryland Law School in
                    Baltimore, spent three years there, was graduated in 1949, and admitted to the
                    Bar.</p>

                    conducted for the next (really) ten years. I also did some other things: I was
                    appointed as an Assistant Attorney General of Maryland; I was appointed later as
                    City Attorney of Frederick; and finally in 1958, I was elected as a delegate to
                    the state legislature—to the General Assembly of Maryland.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, both in the Maryland and in the
                        Frederick aspects of the Attorney General's office were there any problems
                        which could in any way be related to foreign affairs or was it pretty much
                        Maryland?</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, we had one amusing , I say, incident (a little gruesome) that
                    involved Canada. The Attorney General of Maryland (my boss) got a letter from
                    the Attorney General of Canada stating that the hangman of Canada had become
                    superannuated and was going to retire. They were finding themselves in Canada
                    without a hangman, so they wanted to appoint a new hangman, but to appoint a
                    hangman meant they had to find some way to train him. They sought the help of
                    Maryland in training the new hangman of Canada. The two Attorneys General were
                    to undertake this difficult mission, so it got assigned to me. So I communicated
                    with the Canadians. As a result, a very distinguished Queen's Counsel, a very
                    gentlemanly fellow, arrived in Baltimore with the newly appointed hangman who
                    was a French Canadian. He had a World War II record in which he had barehandledy
                    killed (I don't know) eighteen Germans or something of the sort and had shown
                    utterly no emotion. That was his principle qualification for being the new
                    hangman. So the reason they had appealed to Maryland for training assistance was
                    because they had heard that we were about to hang a convicted prisoner, so they
                    wanted to be on hand to witness this event. We had a warden at the State
                    Penitentiary named Vernon Peppersack and he agreed to cooperate so he took the
                    apprentice hangman as his assistant and I think they went through several dummy
                    drills. They hanged a couple of sacks of sand and worked out the gallows. They
                    were all prepared to go forward—I think the hanging was to take place at
                    midnight or some such hour. At 11:45 p.m., the Governor of Maryland commuted the
                    sentence, so there was no hanging. That was the one form of international
                    cooperation that we undertook during my tenure at the State Law Department.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Rural...a very rural community. It had been obviously changed by World
                    War II. Before World War II, it was an essentially southern community: very
                    rural, rigidly segregated, and many overtones of a pre-Civil War culture still
                    in existence. World War II had, I think, begun changes in that because: number
                    one, all of the younger males in the community had gone around the world with
                    their horizons considerably broadened by all of their experiences; and secondly,
                    because there were some federal installations that had come into Frederick that
                    had brought a number of new people to Frederick, who had different backgrounds
                    and points of view. Notably, Fort Detrick which was an Army biological warfare
                    center which involved very highly educated, highly trained scientists from all
                    over the country who were assembled at Fort Detrick and had become part of the
                    Frederick community. So, the change had begun but it hadn't really had a maximum
                    impact by the decade of the fifties. The principle economic support for the
                    community was the milk check—the diary farmers and dairy farming was really the
                    controlling factor in the economy. Everything had to rotate around the needs of
                    the diary farmer. Even if you were setting up a political meeting, you had to
                    consider the fact that the diary farmers had to milk in the late afternoon and
                    in the morning. You had to make sure that your schedule didn't interrupt the
                    milking. But, I suppose it was a very traditional county seat: a small Bar -
                    maybe thirty-five lawyers of varying degrees of engagement in the law and in the
                    time they devoted to it. The judge was a major figure in the community and it
                    was a very traditional community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you're talking about Fort Dietrich being plunked in
                        here and it's been now ten years since approximately 1948 when the military
                        was desegregated and all...I lived from 1939 until 1950 in Annapolis as a
                        kid and I can recall early on, you know, separate waiting rooms for whites
                        and colored (as it was called) and all that...how was segregation played out
                        in the mid to late fifties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: It was still in full force in the early fifties. By the late fifties,
                    there had begun to be some gradual easing, but it was by no means ebbing - it
                    was still pretty strong.</p>

                        proponents of the blacks historically. Did the black vote play any part or
                        was there a black vote?</hi>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Oh, it played a very strong part. There was still an element of the
                    black community that supported the Republican Party. And the Republican Party,
                    particularly in the rural areas like Frederick, made a great pitch for the black
                    vote...counted on it...actively sought it...very different from what later
                    occurred in the Republican Party. Actually as a young boy I had known old men
                    and women who had been born as slaves— had talked to them and heard their
                    description of what it was like to live as a slave in Maryland. Some of these
                    people, having been freed by Lincoln, were absolutely loyal to Lincoln and to
                    the Republican Party. My father used to make sure that some of them would get to
                    the polls: they would be harassed and insulted by poll officials on occasion. He
                    used to try to protect their right to vote and to shepherd them into the polls,
                    but it wasn't always easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to the state legislature in 1958, what were
                        sort of the issues you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, civil rights was coming on. I had had one experience as City
                    Attorney of Frederick—an early experience in civil rights—the City Hall in
                    Frederick which had evolved out of the marketplace was also a theater. It had
                    been a theater, and then converted into a movie house, but that was strictly
                    segregated. The blacks sat in a gallery (known locally as the peanut gallery)
                    and they couldn't sit down on the main floor of the theater. A woman named
                    Juanita Mitchell, whose husband was Clarence Mitchell, came up from Baltimore
                    and initiated legal action to desegregate the theater which was actually within
                    the City Hall—it was part of the City Hall property. I should go back for just a
                    moment to say that at the time, we had as governor a Republican named Theodore
                    Roosevelt McKeldin, who was really quite a remarkable fellow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I remember him as a...word of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: He was very sincerely dedicated to the concept of civil rights and was
                    quite a leader in this field. He had begun it when he first ran for governor - I
                    think he was elected in 1950. Had run on a pro-civil rights platform in 1950,
                    which was very, very early and he took a lot of abuse from the Democrats who
                    were talking the old Dixie line. He was the pro-civil rights figure, so with
                    this background when we had the demand to desegregate the City Hall theater(”
                    City Opera House” as it was called.) I talked to the mayor about it and we
                    together talked to the Board of Aldermen and finally worked out an agreement by
                    which we would voluntarily desegregate and got a consent order from the court to
                    do that. We compromised the case, so that those things did take place. That was
                    the first time that I had met Juanita Mitchell with whom I later did a great
                    deal of business because she and her husband, Clarence Mitchell, were among the
                    foremost civil rights leaders. Among the black community in Baltimore and, of
                    course, nationally, Clarence became one of the leaders of the NAACP.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, the Election of 1958, when I was elected, was a disaster for the
                    Republican Party. The Republican membership in the General Assembly of Maryland
                    fell to its lowest level since the Civil War and I became somewhat conspicuous
                    by the sheer circumstance that I was the only new Republican elected that year.
                    So that was sort of a happenstance, but it made me more conspicuous than I would
                    normally have been. If there had been a dozen new Republicans elected, I would
                    have only been one of twelve and wouldn't have stood out at all, but this turned
                    out as it did. Also, in the same election the member of Congress who represented
                    the Sixth Congressional District was defeated for re-election (his name was
                    Dewitt Hyde, which meant that there was a Democrat in the Sixth District. So
                    there I was a new member of the state legislature receiving more than average
                    attention because of the circumstances, with a Democrat in our Congressional
                    District which was the only congressional district in Maryland that had any
                    reasonable hope of going Republican. So, although I was only half way through my
                    term in the state legislature, I decided to run for the Sixth Congressional
                    District seat and narrowly was elected in the Congressional Election of
                    1960.</p>

                        thought Maryland being renowned as the Catholic state—with a Catholic
                        President—the first one running and winning. I guess you were off to one
                        side, I mean Frederick being not a particularly Catholic area or did this
                        play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: It didn't play a major role in our election. There was still a
                    substantial number of registered Republicans in the far western counties of
                    Maryland which were part of the Sixth District: Allegheny and Garrett counties.
                    The Democrat who had been elected, who had a background in labor law, was an
                    ardent supporter of the unions and demonstrated his support for the unions in
                    many ways went a little too far for public opinion in that regard because
                    Frederick county, for example still being essentially rural, wasn't prepared to
                    take up the cudgels. Montgomery county which although it was comparatively
                    liberal, was also not quite as liberal as the new congressman. So the setting
                    was there and we moved into it with a lot of help and a lot of good fortune
                    narrowly won the seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that area, did foreign affairs of any ilk display

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Not really in that election. That was primarily local issues, domestic
                    politics, the economy. One of the reasons that the election was so bad for the
                    Republicans was because there was a recession in the latter years of the
                    Eisenhower administration. So there was a lot of talk about what could be done
                    in Appalachia to remedy the problems of unemployment that had beset western
                    Maryland.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q: It was very much the focus of attention during the Kennedys' time because
                    Kennedy and Humphrey spent a great deal of time in Appalachia raising this as an
                    issue. When you went in as a freshman congressman at a time when a Democratic
                    president has just taken over from a Republican president, could you
                    characterize first the Republican side and then Congress as a whole? I want to
                    focus always on the time you were there—each hunk . MATHIAS: It was a time of
                    some drama because Eisenhower was leaving the White House. Incidentally, he was
                    wonderful—he extended a great welcome to the new members of Congress although he
                    only had some months yet to serve. I remember he invited the freshmen
                    Republicans down to breakfast at the White House and gave a direct, personal
                    kind of talk. It was a wonderful introduction to national service. But of course
                    the Kennedy bandwagon was rolling along and there was this sense of change in
                    the air. There was a sense that the country was prepared for some change. At
                    that point, the Republicans in the House of Representatives had allied
                    themselves very firmly with the Dixiecrats of whom one of the leaders was Judge
                    Howard W. Smith of Virginia, the Chairman of the House Rules Committee.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: The Dixiecrats were Democrats who were very
                    conservative—ultra-conservative: they were conservative on social issues such as
                    civil rights, they were conservative on economic issues, they were even more
                    conservative than the conservative Republicans. The

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about 1959 when you came into Congress and
                        how you all fitted into that...excuse me—1961 actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Actually January of 1961. The coalition between the Republicans and the
                    Dixiecrats had the potential of really controlling the House of Representatives.
                    The Republican leader was Charlie Halleck of Indiana and the Dixiecrat leader
                    was Judge Howard W. Smith of Virginia. They had a very close coalition that
                    could have really prevented the Kennedy Administration from putting any of its
                    major proposals before the House because the Rules Committee could have
                    precluded movement of legislation to the House floor. So the real first order of
                    business was how to deal with this situation: the only way the more progressive
                    members of Congress saw to loosen up the flow of legislation—make it possible
                    for the Kennedy program to at least come up for a vote (whether it was accepted
                    or not) was to enlarge the Rules Committee and therefore to somewhat dilute
                    Judge Smith's control. So that was the primary issue for the first thirty days
                    of the new Congress: there were no votes other than for speakers as I recall.
                    Everything rested on this issue of the expansion of the Rules Committee and it
                    became a very partisan kind of vote as it naturally would. There were, however,
                    in those days a significant number of progressive Republicans - “Bull Moosers”
                    if you want to revive that old phrase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The progressive period of Teddy Roosevelt and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I naturally gravitated toward the “Bull Moosers”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought...just to get a feel for American
                        politics—this sounds like your predilection rather than your area. You were
                        coming from what would be considered a normally conservative area—diary
                        farming. Halleck was from... Smith—all these people were essentially small
                        county boys as opposed to big city boys and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: But my grandfather had been a “Bull Mooser”, my father was always one of
                    the Republicans who was on the progressive side and that was our family
                    tradition and so that's where I was when I arrived in Congress. I also had some
                    experience during my brief legislative service at Annapolis in the fact that
                    somehow you...sometimes you had to re-organize committees in order to move
                    legislation, so that was not a new concept to me. I met with the progressive
                    Republicans in the Congress and to make a long story short, we finally voted on
                    the question of enlarging the Rules Committee which for a rather simple house
                    keeping question had serious portent. It was a very close vote, in fact, the
                    decision was the result of the votes of four freshmen Republicans. One was Bill
                    Scranton of Pennsylvania (later governor of Pennsylvania), one was Brad Morris
                    of Massachusetts, one was Abner Sibal of Connecticut, and myself. Without our
                    four votes the motion to enlarge the Rules Committee would not have carried.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Of course, that put me in a somewhat difficult position. Immediately, I went all
                    through my Congressional District and explained why I had done it—why I thought
                    it was important. I must say with a great deal of gratitude that people were
                    willing to listen and think about it—that got me started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this congressional battle which was on a sort of
                        really conservative versus liberal maybe a little more progressive line, did
                        this have any foreign affairs overtones to it or not, or was foreign policy
                        relatively bipartisan at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I think that foreign affairs were bipartisan: they had been during the
                    Eisenhower years. Eisenhower had leaned very heavily on the Democratic
                    leadership of the Congress and they worked harmoniously together. At that point
                    there were no foreign policy implications that I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having voted sort of against on a very partisan
                        issue—voting against essentially the leadership of your party, did you find
                        that when they handed out assignments—you were a freshman. How did that work
                        out? Were you punished or was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Charlie Halleck was very generous on that. Charlie, although he had the
                    reputation of being a hard shell conservative Republican, was very fair. The one
                    thing that he didn't like was to be surprised: if you went to him in advance and
                    said that you were not going to be with him on a certain vote, he might not like
                    it, but he accepted it. As a result, there were not repercussions from the
                    leadership. I always had a very constructive relationship with Charlie
                    Halleck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What communities did you go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I went to the Judiciary Committee which was my first choice and went to
                    the District Committee which was necessary because my congressional district
                    abutted on the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at a time particularly when there still was not
                        home rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: That was before home rule and the District of Columbia was really a
                    function of the Federal Government. To Charlie Halleck's credit, there were no
                    adverse reactions to the vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Judiciary Committee, there probably were some
                        foreign policy or foreign affairs issues. I can think of immigration right
                        now, was immigration much of an issue during that period you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, immigration, but there were also specific foreign policy questions
                    that immediately came up. The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee was Emmanuel
                    Celler of New York and he was very interested in refugees from East Europe
                    particularly the Soviet Union. We had a function of the Judiciary Committee
                    which was to authorize and really to oversee the program to bring Eastern
                    European (Red Block)—Warsaw Pact Block refugees out of Eastern Europe either to
                    the United States or to some other country or perhaps Israel. The Judiciary
                    Committee pursued that very vigorously and, as I say, really had oversight of
                    that program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you have oversight...just to get a feel for
                        how Congress worked...immigration is run essentially - the State Department
                        gives the visas, Immigration Service which is under the Department of
                        Justice admits or not admits people. How did you work as far as overseeing
                        looking at this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, there was a special program for these Eastern European refugees as
                    I recall ( and I'm subject to correction) - it was called “ICEM”, the
                    Intergovernmental Committee on European Migration. But Emanual Celler was really
                    the chief proponent. This involved going to refugee camps in Austria seeing how
                    the flow from Eastern Europe was going on. All of this was the work of the
                    Judiciary Committee and it was funded, rather generously funded, and refugees
                    that didn't come to the United States were say sent to another country - perhaps
                    South America or perhaps Israel and money was provided to help them get
                    re-established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the driving force behind this...I think Emanual Celler
                        was Jewish...sometimes you have these programs which an earlier one was the
                        Refugee Relief Program which was the main goal was really to bring Italians
                        into the United States ...sort of an odd program, but that had ended by the
                        time we're talking about. But was the driving force to get Soviet Block Jews
                        to Israel or was it really a broader one in your sense of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I think it was somewhat broader: obviously that was one of the parts of
                    the program, but it also moved people to other locations. But as a result of
                    that I was (not immediately—not in the first year or two, but ultimately)
                    involved in that oversight which required going to some of these refugee centers
                    and seeing how it actually worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at this time of how the State
                        Department was handling this and also the Immigration Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, at this distance I don't remember too many of the details, but it
                    seemed to be going along reasonably satisfactorily. There was strong support for
                    it in the Congress and the State Department seemed to be carrying out the
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the camps that you were
                        seeing? Because this was really your first time as a responsible person for
                        an element of foreign affairs in getting out and taking a look at
                        things.*</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, this was an educational experience because I had had the benefit
                    of some experience during the War seeing different kinds of situations. This was
                    somewhat new and it involved dealing with the governments in the countries that
                    were actually receiving the refugees. It involved dealing with the countries
                    where the refugees ultimately would settle including Israel. Israel was, of
                    course, desperate for economic aid: they needed, as I recall, something like
                    $25,000 for every immigrant they accepted in terms of getting them organized and
                    giving them some sort of orientation training, and some sort of job training. It
                    was a complicated and expensive operation and we were involved in all aspects of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your district, I take it, there was no interest one
                        way or another in this, was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Not a very strong although on the Montgomery County side there was more
                    than average.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Montgomery County has an international group, I
                        mean, working out of Washington, but also probably that is where the largest
                        Jewish group is, isn't it? ...Sort of in Maryland and all that...connected
                        to the American government. This ICEM procedure —was this pretty much
                        bipartisan at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, the ranking Republican member of the Judiciary Committee was a very
                    fine member from Ohio, named William McCulloch. He took an active interest and
                    worked very cooperatively with Emanual Celler. So there was a Republican
                    activity in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the some of the initiatives that the Kennedy
                        administration took? I am thinking of the Alliance for Progress and the
                        Peace Corps—this idea of almost ostentatiously seizing leadership and all
                        that around the world? How did this sit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: It got a somewhat mixed reaction in some respects. The Kennedys were
                    very attractive and the public was intrigued and was interested in what they
                    were doing and in what they were thinking and in what they were proposing, but
                    sometimes it wore a little thin. I remember one embarrassing situation: Robert
                    Kennedy when he was Attorney General was sent around the world to sort of beat
                    the drum for the new American policy and, of course, in the Justice Department
                    there was no funding for any kind of international travel on that scale. So the
                    way his trip was funded was to use the travel funds that had been appropriated
                    for the use of the State Department in the normal traveling of diplomats. As a
                    result of the Kennedy around the world trip, all of the travel funds
                    appropriated for the State Department had been expended. Ambassadors who were
                    being transferred from one post to another would be languishing at their old
                    posts because there were no funds to move them to their new posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that there was a travel freeze at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Travel freeze—people sitting around doing nothing because their job had
                    terminated where they were and they couldn't get a ticket to go to where they
                    should be. Those sorts of situations weren't do or die, but they were
                    embarrassing and they wore thin a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While I've got you here, I might as well ask you a few
                        questions. Robert Kennedy was the Attorney General and you were on the
                        Judiciary Committee—at the time that he was doing that and you were on the
                        Judiciary Committee, what was your impression of how he operated? Were there
                        any sort of problems—you're being both a Republican or just a member of
                        Congress—of another agency of the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We saw a great deal of Bob Kennedy on the Judiciary Committee: he would
                    come down and testify on various matters. So I got to know him—I personally
                    liked him. I thought he was a very useful, positive person, but he could be
                    pretty tough. He could be difficult—difficult to deal with. Later, when we got
                    into the civil rights phase, we saw even more of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, what role did the civil rights efforts which were
                        really initiated much under Kennedy and particularly later under Johnson,
                        but Kennedy kicked it off? You were on a committee which until you arrived
                        had a Dixiecrat caste to it ...how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: That had had a very inhibiting effect on Kennedy—the tone of the
                    Congress. During the 1960 campaign, Jack Kennedy had on more than one occasion
                    said that, “The first bill that will be introduced in the new Congress is the
                    Civil Rights Bill,” and he said, “I am so determined that this will be the case
                    that I have asked Senator Clark of Pennsylvania and Congressman Celler of New
                    York to draft the bill now (that is “now” during the campaign) so that it will
                    be ready to introduce when the new Congress meets...convenes in January of
                    1961.” January of 1961 came and went and there was no Kennedy Civil Rights Bill.
                    Months and months went on and (again subject to going back and looking at the
                    record) I don't think Kennedy's Civil Rights Bill ever got introduced into that
                    87th Congress at all. It wasn't until the 88th Congress convened in January,
                    1963 that we really got serious about civil rights and at that point there still
                    was no Kennedy Bill. But John Lindsay of New York, who was still a Republican at
                    that time, and Bill McCulloch of Ohio, who was the ranking Republican on the
                    Judiciary Committee, and I joined as three co-sponsors to introduce a Civil
                    Rights Bill. And because of the fact that we introduced this Republican bill
                    that induced the Kennedy administration to finally introduce its bill two years
                    late, but it came on. Then I remember Robert Kennedy came down and testified
                    before the Committee about the Administration bill and I remember an exchange in
                    which John Lindsay said, “Well, have you read our bill?” and Bob Kennedy said,
                    “I can't read every bill.”...very testy exchange. But that was the sequence of
                    events as I recall it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the impetus behind this to really get something going
                        on the part of you, Lindsay and McCulloch or was this one of these ploys to
                        embarrass the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Not at all - it was a genuine effort. It built on the efforts of the
                    Eisenhower Administration: Herbert Brownell, the Attorney General under the
                    Eisenhower Administration had been genuinely interested in moving civil rights
                    and we were building on his record and on the historic Republican thrust which
                    began with the Emancipation Proclamation. It was in that tradition that we were
                    moving in. It wasn't just a cheap trick to embarrass Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding that the main opposition to this was
                        coming really from at that time the Republican South, I mean the
                        representatives from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, of course, the South was still the solid South, it was still
                    Democratic. There was total opposition from the solid South and there was
                    opposition from other parts of the country as well, but it was total and massive
                    from the South. That included people like Judge Smith and other southerners in
                    the House, but it included Senator Thurmond, Senator Ervin, Senator Russell—all
                    of the deeply entrenched members of the Senate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes...had a very serious impact on the Congress. In those days, I
                    suppose the majority of the members of Congress were veterans of World War II,
                    so they weren't unaware of these global events and the implications. But there
                    was a sense of real danger in Washington during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I
                    think maybe an exaggerated sense of danger, but none-the-less people felt that
                    they were sitting on a target and I think that heightened the awareness of the
                    possibilities of Soviet problems. The whole Cuban Missile Crisis I think had an
                    effect of ratcheting up the tensions of the Cold War. I personally had an
                    interesting experience during the Cuban Missile Crisis: by coincidence my annual
                    Navy Reserve duty had been scheduled for that period and I went off to do that
                    training and ended up in the nose cone of a P-2 patrol plane, Navy patrol
                    plane...</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Anti-submarine. We actually (what we called) rigged the Soviet ships
                    that were moving the missiles out of Cuba. We would circle over them and then go
                    down to a low altitude and the Russian sailors would peel back the tarps and
                    show us the missiles that were lying on their deck. It was very dramatic
                    experience. So one way or another, I think the Congress became fully engaged in
                    a much more personal way in the Cold War as a result of the Cuban Missile
                    Crisis. It was not anymore a theoretical thing happening somewhere else, but it
                    was something that might happen right here.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: No, of course this again was part of the Eisenhower legacy. He had made
                    a very deliberate, positive effort to make sure that the United States had an
                    internationalist point of view. He encountered some hard-shell Republican

                <p>MATHIAS: That's right and there were things like the Bricker Amendment, but they

                        towards Africa? This was just about the time that Kennedy came in—the
                        majority of the countries in Africa were becoming independent nations and
                        all and there was quite a lot of excitement about that...about sort of
                        America's going to get involved because we were a revolutionary country and
                        these countries are coming in and all. Were you...was sort of the excitement

                    of the Peace Corps which was sending people to Africa. On one occasion when

                    critical activities of the Committee and it was several years before I got to
                    that Subcommittee. It may be that testimony of that sort was in the Chairman's

                <p>MATHIAS: At a fairly early date I did. I think that my pattern was not typical,
                    but the first couple of years in the Congress were necessarily learning the
                    ropes, attending to the domestic chores that need to be done, but fairly early I
                    began to be involved in one way or another in foreign affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, for instance—one of my first committees in the House of
                    Representatives was the Judiciary and I may have mentioned this before the
                    program for bringing refugees out of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which
                    was under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee through its authority over
                    Immigration and Naturalization.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: He was from Pennsylvania. He was rather a conservative Democrat, but he
                    worked very closely with Emanual Celler, the Chairman of the Committee, and they
                    ran a very tight operation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With immigration as far as your constituency went, were

                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, it wasn't a big local issue with us, but channeling the money to
                    the programs bringing people out of Eastern Europe, overseeing the refugee
                    centers that were established in Austria. I suppose that may have been my first
                    foreign trip was on that business. The Chancellor of Austria in those days was
                    Krieskie and he, by a curious coincidence, was some relation of Emanual Celler.
                    Perhaps...I don't remember the exact relationship, but there was something
                    there. Of course, Krieskie was an interesting figure— not standard politician—a
                    little bit different and he was one of the first foreign leaders that I met
                    while going to Vienna with Emanual Celler.</p>

                        finding a place for Jews or was it broader than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I think he had a broader concept of immigration, but this particular
                    program was, of course, focused on getting people out of Eastern Europe, out of
                    the Soviet Union and to a large degree that meant Soviet Jewry.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Of course, I was elected in November of 1960 at the same time as
                    Kennedy. Somewhat paradoxically because I was elected as a Republican in a
                    Democratic presidential year.</p>

                    interest to a what was otherwise a worldwide program. So, I was necessarily
                    interested in that. Alliance for Progress was a little more distant, dealing
                    with Latin America and that wasn't quite as topical, but none-the-less these
                    were all involved with the issues of that period.</p>

                        in Vietnam. How did this hit you as you watched this develop in the House?
                        What was your initial impression about Vietnam and that of you colleagues
                        about what we were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We, of course, it wasn't a very big story. I don't recall that in the
                    Election of 1960 that it was a campaign issue at all—it was never mentioned.
                    President Eisenhower had made some very tentative steps in the direction of
                    Vietnam, but they were not in the public consciousness at all. It wasn't until
                    well into the Kennedy Administration that it began to receive any public
                    notice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were several things in the Kennedy Administration:
                        one was early on the concern about what the Soviets were up to—the Berlin
                        Wall and all. Again what was the attitude of Congress towards these moves by
                        the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, I think the Congress was fairly unified in its attitude toward the
                    Soviet Union and its tactics, including the construction of the Wall...</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Missiles in Cuba certainly, the Berlin Blockade...</p>
                <p>I think there was essential unity in the Congress in opposing the aggressive and
                    disruptive activities of the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Not really, no. It was such a low profile item that I think very few
                    people even knew it existed, let alone were exercised about it.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Ran against the incumbent Senator - his name was Daniel Brewster.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, it was a fairly straight forward campaign. Senator Brewster had
                    some personal problems that complicated his position and we just plugged along.
                    Actually there was a third candidate in the race named George P. Mahoney, who
                    took rather conservative positions.</p>

                    (not a majority) of the votes and got elected in a three way race.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, I was certainly supportive of Israel which is the way I felt very
                    strongly and still feel very strongly. I think the whole situation has altered a
                    lot in this thirty-five year period. There were opportunities to state that
                    position and I think it was an important element in the campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being a Senator under...well, let's

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: That's right. I remember I went to the White House to make a farewell
                    call to President and Mrs. Johnson and _____. Vietnam was very much part of the
                    scene at that time—his son in law...</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: No, the other one was actually on an air patrol ( air operation) at the
                    very moment that we were sitting in the Oval Office. I remember that the
                    President got periodic reports about where he was. I got the distinct impression
                    that it was not a good situation for the President of the United States to hear
                    minute by minute where his relatives are in a combat picture. You either ought
                    to keep them out of combat or keep their activities quiet, but that is another
                    story. But on that occasion he told me why he decided not to run for president.
                    He said that he needed a tax bill and the Republicans wouldn't give him a tax
                    bill to support the dollar if he were a candidate. He wanted to get the peace
                    process started and Ho Chi Minh wouldn't negotiate with him on peace if he were
                    a candidate for re-election. He realized that he couldn't campaign in cities
                    because of the anti-war activities, so that it would be very difficult to run a
                    campaign. Finally, he pointed to the portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt which was
                    hanging on the wall and he said, “I don't want to go out of this house the way
                    he did—in a box.”</p>

                        I recall, he keep mentioning the fact that his family died at the age of
                        sixty-four which is the age that he died at too.</hi>

                        in Vietnam at one time or another. What was your impression of Nixon when he
                        came in? He had been a Senator, been Vice- President, and he had been out in
                        the wilderness for some time. He was coming out—at least initially coming
                        out of what appeared to be—the right wing of the Republican Party. Here you
                        were on what could be called the left wing of the party, what was your
                        impression of Nixon at that time?</hi>

                <p>MATHIAS: Did I tell you at our last session about my working with him?</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: A week after his inauguration, I was invited to come down to the White
                    House for breakfast. In the week that he had been President, one of the first
                    things that Nixon had done was to modify the embargo on Chinese goods. He didn't
                    lift the embargo entirely, but he softened it. At the end of this breakfast, I
                    went to the President and I said, “I noticed what you did on the Chinese embargo
                    and I just wanted to let you know that I'm very supportive of that. I think it
                    is very important to reach out to try to establish some communication with the
                    Chinese.” And he said, “Well, just wait—that is only the beginning: what we're
                    going to do with China is a great deal more than that. Just wait and see.” So,
                    really he arrived with his Chinese policy and one that he executed very directly
                    and consistently. He worked along somewhat patiently until the opportunities
                    arose and then he developed the policy and carried it out. But it's always
                    interesting to me that he must have arrived at the White House with that Chinese
                    plan in his suitcase.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: I again went on the Judiciary Committee as I had been in the House and
                    was on... I think my other first committees were Government Operations and
                    Judiciary. Then shortly thereafter I transferred to Appropriations.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Appropriations—very much so because I was on the subcommittees that

                <p>MATHIAS: No, I can't honestly say that I can remember anyone who had that...with
                    whom I was immediately dealing. There were a lot of people who had particular
                    causes, but nothing like the occasional situation you have where anything the

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: They were pretty much professionals in those early days. The Senate
                    staff had not been politicized as to the extent that it has been now. Many of
                    the committees didn't have majority/minority divisions on the staff: the staff
                    served the whole committee regardless of party and it worked very well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Nixon Administration was in (came in) then in 1969—the
                        war was really heating up in Vietnam. Tet had already come and gone, but
                        there were tremendous mobs and all this. What sort of pressures were you
                        feeling on Vietnam with your constituency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: By that time, of course, Vietnam was a very big issue and there were
                    very strong pressures for peace. A lot of activity in Maryland on the peace side
                    and it was incumbent on us to be as fully informed as we possibly could. I took
                    every opportunity to learn as much about the war as I possibly could. By that
                    time, people were beginning to worry about the number of missing in action. On
                    one occasion when I was in France, I sought out a French general who had been in
                    command in the French Indochina part of the War and I talked to him about this.
                    I think he told me that the French had something like 50,000 missing in action,
                    which is, of course, an enormous number of unaccounted for compared with any
                    figures we have encountered. He described the combat conditions and said that in
                    his opinion it was almost impossible to avoid those kinds of casualties and
                    given the terrain, given the climate, given the general situation he felt that
                    having a large number of missing in action was just a normal part of the cost of
                    the war. On another occasion (it might have been on the same trip) I was in
                    Paris and Fritz Nolting who had been our Ambassador in Saigon by that time was
                    out of government and was working for J.P. Morgan and was in charge of the Paris
                    office. I went to see him and I remember the occasion very well. Again, trying
                    to educate myself on the some of the background of the war, I was fascinated by
                    one thing he said which was that during his time as ambassador he would be
                    called back to Washington for meeting to discuss developments and at these
                    meetings when the question of expanding the number of troops arose or enlarging
                    the field of operation, almost the only person who could be expected to
                    consistently oppose was Lyndon Johnson, who was then Vice-President. This is so
                    different from the image of Johnson as President in expanding the war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: You do it every way you can. You talk to all sorts of people: talk to
                    service men coming home, you talk to foreign service officers, you talk to
                    Department people. You have to use every means that you can get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that the largest educational institution is the
                        University of Maryland, isn't it? Some of the universities really were very
                        strong anti-war voices, how did you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, that was a constant problem. I remember early one morning getting
                    a phone call from Lincoln Gordon who was the president of Johns Hopkins...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been an ambassador under Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Right. And he said that he wanted me to come over to Hopkins right away
                    and I wanted to know why. He said that they were facing a student riot and I
                    said, “What do you want me for?” and he said, “Well, maybe you would have some
                    influence. It would be helpful if you could be here.” So to make a long story
                    short, I finally agreed to come and spoke briefly to the students without much
                    effect, as I recall, and they went out and burned some shanty down in the course
                    of the demonstration. I remembered it particularly because it is an example of
                    how you can get caught by the press: I was exhorting these students to exercise
                    their political rights to press their agenda through the political process, and
                    they would have more effect than they had ultimately in rioting on the campus.
                    The evening news showed a little clip in which I was saying to the students,
                    “This is your hour, this is your moment...” and while I went on to say, “... to
                    exercise your political leadership”, but they left that out and it just looked
                    as though I was cheering them on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very difficult period. My wife was getting her
                        degree at the University of Maryland at this time while I was off in Saigon.
                        When I used to come back, we didn't have a real meeting of minds for awhile.
                        It was hard. What sort of pressure were you getting from the President as
                        far as saying, “You've got to support me and I know what I am trying to do”
                        and all that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, in the early Nixon days, we got a fair amount of that pressure and
                    it included being invited to the White House to meet with the President in small
                    groups to discuss particular issues or particular votes that were impending. As
                    time went on, I developed a fairly marked record of moving toward a more
                    independent position—moving towards ending the war and getting out. So that
                    affected my relationship with the White House and I saw less of the White House
                    after that than before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he really did keep a list (didn't he?) during that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of, say, the Democratic side of
                        the equation in the Senate? Was there a growing disillusionment or was the
                        pressure getting more and more intense on both parties or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, of course, it had gotten very tense as far as Senator Fulbright was
                    concerned during the Johnson period when Fulbright held his hearings which were
                    so critical of Johnson—either explicitly or implicitly. That sort of drew a line
                    in the sand right there and in a strange way that atmosphere prevails after
                    Nixon took over. There was a sharp division between the people who wanted to
                    continue the war and people who wanted to bring an end to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One has the impression that between Fulbright and Johnson
                        there was a certain amount of animus—more than just policy (but I don't
                        know.) Was that sort of the impression that one got that...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, it got to be fairly personal. With Johnson policy questions very
                    often did: in Fulbright's case it was personal, but there were also people like
                    Mike Mansfield who were much more dispassionate and reserved, but still very
                    firm in his view. There were a few Democrats who supported the Nixon policy—John
                    Stennis for example.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: So that neither party was totally committed toward it: there were shades
                    of opinions in both parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself at any particular time on this whole
                        Vietnam thing coming to almost a dividing thing of saying maybe begrudging
                        support or not being sure of the issues so the President gets your support
                        up to the point where you say, “We've really got to get out of there.” I
                        mean was there a dividing time and did that develop or how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, it did. And, of course, that brought me to the point of acting and
                    introducing a resolution to repeal the Tonkin Gulf Resolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Fulbright had sponsored!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with the effort to repeal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, for a long time it was not allowed to come up for a
                    vote...couldn't bring it up to a vote. Then interestingly enough a worse
                    situation evolved to a point that Bob Dole introduced the same resolution and
                    called it up for a vote immediately and it was passed. But it was his resolution
                    that passed rather than mine. But it was a totally different context by the time
                    that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had brought you to this point in your own sort of
                        personal evaluation of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Oh, of course, a continuing concern with what was happening on the
                    ground in Vietnam—that we weren't winning (if “winning” is the right word)—we
                    were not being successful in the way we sought to be successful. The enormous
                    price of it—not in dollar terms alone, but in the political price that we were
                    paying. The general disruption that was being created. It just seemed to me that
                    we had reached a point we had to put an end to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were others of your colleagues in the Senate—would you
                        sort of get together and talk this over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Definitely. We had a group of very harmonious members that met on
                    Wednesdays which was a fairly small group and we had lunch every Wednesday—that
                    was one forum where we could discuss the war among other issues. That was all
                    Republicans, but there were some other ad hoc groups that would be bipartisan.
                    So, there was a lot of quiet, thoughtful discussion going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the information you were
                        getting from the State Department on how things were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, we're talking about a long time ago. I don't recall that people
                    ever accused the State Department of deliberately misrepresenting the facts, but
                    I think that people had the feeling that perhaps there was more to know than
                    they were being told.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have a chance to get over to Vietnam?</hi>

                <p>MATHIAS: Never. Never made that trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These trips really don't show much usually. You're bundled
                        off and taken and given almost packaged tours and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Briefings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefings...military briefings are terrible I think
                        because they tend to give the party line straight on and it's hard to get
                        into a real discussion. We might as well follow the Vietnam thing through:
                        how did this...at the end of the Vietnam thing, there was a time when
                        Congress voted a cut off to aid (military aid) to South Vietnam which in a
                        way was a final nail in the coffin of the South Vietnamese. I suspect...I'm
                        quite sure that they would have collapsed anyway. It certainly moved things.
                        What was your feeling on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, of course, the Nixon Administration had utilized every possible
                    way to keep things going. I remember at one occasion Mel Laird, who was then
                    Secretary of Defense at the time, exhumed a Food and Forage Act which was a
                    relic from the 19th century which provided that when a cavalry commander got out
                    beyond his normal source of supply, he could go to farmers and make a commitment
                    that they would be paid for the hay that he would impound for his horses. Mel
                    used the authority of the Food and Forage Act to get credit to keep going in
                    Vietnam. There were extreme interpretations of legislation that was on the book.
                    So, I think the mood developed in Congress that you just had to cut everything
                    off because there were no halfway measures that would be effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Toward the very end, Nixon had left because of Watergate
                        and Ford was in. Did you have the feeling that when Nixon left that this
                        pretty much...that Ford was more the man to maybe preside over the end of
                        things or..?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I think that was the feeling that we had reached the end of that
                    rope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened towards the end, I mean when Vietnam fell
                        (this would be in 1974, I guess) in the spring of 1975? What were sort of
                        the concerns in the Senate at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, the prisoners of war was a major issue...missing in action,
                    repatriation of people as quickly as possible. There was not, as I recall, a
                    great concentration of attention on what was going to happen in Vietnam itself.
                    The curtain had been pulled on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come on the Foreign Relations Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: In 1980 - I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So up to 1980...so the other big foreign policy issue was
                        Israel and all: there was the 1973 War during this time. This was before
                        Carter came in. You say that you were a staunch supporter of Israel: did you
                        see a problem (I think it is one within the Foreign Service we have always
                        had difficulty dealing on the domestic/political side) because if you're
                        dealing with American foreign relations you're up against the fact that you
                        have a vast Arab area, a very small Jewish area and that the Arab area is
                        also sitting on major resources. So if you're looking at American interests,
                        it's hard to say our interests are completely with Israel and opposed to the
                        Arab one; but on the domestic side, the sympathy and all goes with Israel.
                        Was this a problem for you and your fellow Senators in dealing with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Yes, it is a problem and it's one that can't be avoided because you can
                    have great sympathy with what the Israelis are trying to do—create a nation out
                    of a very difficult landscape and a difficult climate. But you will also have to
                    consider the equities that the Arab people...and this was a constant difficulty.
                    Sometimes, trying to persuade the Israelis that their real interest was in being
                    more flexible than they were disposed to be at any given moment and sometimes it
                    took very hard bargaining with them. I thought we should support them as best we
                    could, but I thought we also needed to remind them from time to time that there
                    were problems in their situation that went further than they were sometimes
                    willing to admit. In that connection, I remember once when Rabin was Prime
                    Minister, that was the first when he was - in the 1970's, and I was having a
                    conversation with him in Israel. I said to him, “I think one of Israel's great
                    dangers is maybe viewed as intransigent by American public opinion.” He looked
                    at me and he said, “As the Prime Minister of Israel, the only public opinion
                    that I am concerned about is Israeli public opinion.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you know, he obviously knew...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: He knew what I was talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He could say that, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: We both understood each other. But as that conversation illustrates, we
                    had an opportunity to have a pretty free exchange—voicing our concerns and our
                    views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about public opinion in Maryland? As Senator, what

                <p>MATHIAS: Every time that there was a vote that impinged on the situation, you

                <p>MATHIAS: Simply sit down with the people and try to talk out the issue in respect
                    to Israel. With the AWACS, it's a good example of the need for the AWACS from
                    the Saudi's point of view was in large measure because of the trouble with Iran
                    which was a matter of just a few minutes just across the Persian Gulf to the oil
                    fields of eastern Saudi Arabia. Without some early warning system, such as the
                    AWACS could provide them, they were really sitting ducks for lightning raids out
                    of Iran. I would get maps of the region and try to explain it to audiences or
                    the groups that came to visit me and we would talk these things out. Even if you
                    couldn't persuade them to adopt your point of view, at least understand that
                    you're making decisions on a rational basis and sometimes that was the best you
                    could do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Carter Administration came in, what was your
                        impression of Carter's leadership particularly in the field of foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, I don't think it inspired any particular confidence in the field
                    of foreign affairs and like many presidents, as I recall, he had a sort of slow
                    start to foreign policy operations. Cyrus Vance was very experienced and really
                    a splendid person to be Secretary of State both by temperament and by experience
                    he was a good candidate for Secretary of State. I think that side of it worked
                    out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's continue with the Israeli side and finish that up.
                        What about Camp David? What was the Senate feeling and your feeling about as
                        the Camp David process began to develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, of course that was one of the hopeful things. That had been
                    preceded by Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and all the emotion that that evoked.
                    Camp David was really trying to reduce that emotional development to a practical
                    result. So, I think it was generally supportive and I think President Carter was
                    generally admired for the role that he played.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that was far more partisan was the Panama Canal

                        feeling about the Panama Canal Treaty returning the Panama Canal to
                        Panamanian control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I was generally supportive of that. The cost of maintaining it in
                    colonial status was beyond any reasonable hope of getting a return on it. The
                    time had come to work out some other method. After all, what we wanted was the
                    use of the canal: we didn't have to have the title deed to the canal. That
                    generally was the policy I followed.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: Some, yes—but not excessive. As I recall, some of the veterans' groups,
                    some of the right wing groups were heard from, but it wasn't undo pressure,
                    no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about issues like Carter at first looking towards the
                        Soviet Union and thinking that maybe we could reach better relations through
                        more business relations and all? This was before they went into
                        Afghanistan—how did you feel about Carter's attempt to open up a real
                        dialogue with the Soviets on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I thought that was worth doing. After all, the Nixon Administration had
                    gone a long way towards reaching out to some rapport with the Soviet Union. The
                    Carter approach was not that all dissimilar: it might have had a slightly
                    different accent, but it was not an innovative effort.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Of course that changed the scene markedly and after that there was much
                    less interest in extending our reach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Carter took some rather drastic steps: canceling
                        our Olympics, canceling wheat deals. Generally was this basically
                        supported?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: To tell you the truth, I disagreed with him on both of those issues. I
                    thought those were excessive. We could show our displeasure in other ways that
                    were not as disruptive of an ongoing effort to build some sort of international
                    structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time—just a little before the Soviets went
                        into Afghanistan, we had the seizure of our Embassy in Tehran by radical
                        Islamic movements. How did you feel about steps the Administration was
                        taking to deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, of course you have to go back really to the steps that the
                    President took or didn't take with respect to the Shah. I'm not sure even to
                    this day that our policy with regard to Iran was correct. We might have been
                    able with a little more leadership to deflect some of the problems that erupted
                    there. It's difficult to say, but I'm not sure that the Carter Administration's
                    handling of Iran problems from the beginning of the difficulties were the
                    optimum steps. I think it will be interesting as scholars get access to the
                    records of those periods to reconstruct what was done and compare it with what
                    might have been done.</p>

                        say) the forces of history, but there we certainly did not cover ourselves
                        with glory. What about Ronald Reagan who became President in 1981? Again,
                        here you are a moderate Republican and Ronald Reagan is coming out of very
                        much the right hand side of the party. How did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I had supported George Bush very enthusiastically in his candidacy and
                    disappointed when he didn't prevail. I had some apprehension when Reagan took
                    over: I wasn't sure what sort of administration he would really have. But it
                    became evident fairly soon that it was not going to be as radical a change as I
                    had feared.</p>

                        in the field of foreign affairs. You moved to the Foreign Relations
                        Committee at that time—what was your impression of it? Can you describe it
                        in 1981? I mean what type of committee would you call it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, it was a committee that was fairly... I don't know if I want to
                    say harmonious because they certainly had some bitter disputes, but I would say
                    it was a fairly unified committee with a fairly broad view of global problems.
                    It took a fairly broad view of what American commitments were and had a good
                    deal of deference for the President as the architect of foreign policy, but
                    wasn't hesitant about criticizing when they felt that was necessary. It was a

                    Union particularly in the military confrontations with the Soviet Union, nuclear
                    policy, that kind of thing was as close to divisive issues as we had.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: Well, I had made my first trip to the Soviet Union back in 1975 (perhaps
                    - maybe 1976) and so I had begun to have some first hand experience of what the
                    Soviet Union was like. I'm not suggesting that a Congressional junket is the
                    answer to knowing a country, but you begin to get some sense of what it is
                    about.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: I had made one or two more trips to the Soviet Union by that time and I
                    was not without hope that we would someday be able to work out a coexistence.
                    Like most Americans, I think I probably gave the Soviet Union more credit than
                    it deserved for its strength and ability to project policies. In any event, we
                    viewed it as a formidable competitor.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: No, it took us by surprise when it came. I don't recall any predictions

                <p>MATHIAS: Very helpful, but that had been true before I went on the Foreign
                    Relations Committee. Generally, I thought the State Department was constructive,
                    helpful in its relations with members of Congress—tried to get the answers,
                    tried to get the information that was requested, knocked themselves out to be
                    helpful if you were on trips. I was very impressed really with the general

                <p>MATHIAS: We had some direct talks with the Israelis about that. I remember on one
                    occasion Menachem Begin came to the Foreign Relations Committee, and we raised
                    with him the questions of using airplanes supplied by the United States to bomb
                    these refugee camps. Begin reacted with a good deal of heat and didn't feel that
                    as Prime Minister of Israel that he should have been subjected to that criticism
                    face to face. They were very lively exchanges: I remember one Senator in the
                    heat of the moment said, “Let me tell you, Jack.” And Begin saying, “My name is
                    not Jack - it is Menachem.” So we had those kinds of frank discussions.</p>

                <p>MATHIAS: I don't know that there was a change in the basic relationship, but I
                    think that there was perhaps a more pragmatic climate. As when we raised some
                    remonstrance about the bombing of the refugees, other activities that we were
                    concerned with, but these were the same kinds of things that I had discussed

                        Reagan Administration during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: In some respects, yes. Because I made no bones about where I was on this
                    and I think that was understood: therefore, I wasn't necessarily taken into camp
                    on all the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the whole Iran-Contra business—how did that hit
                        you? I mean that was selling arms to our (in a way) mortal enemies the
                        Iranians in order to get some hostages out of Beirut and using the money to
                        go to the Contras.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: It just didn't make any sense at all. It had to be viewed as an
                    aberration and I still think it was. It was contradictory of the President's
                    policies—of the President's statements. It flew right in the face of what he was
                    tried to do and the payoff was very meager—I think two hostages. It just didn't
                    make any sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that this was the
                        President...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: It should have been cut off by the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that the President was either—that
                        this was the President's policy or that he was being very ill served by his
                        National Security apparatus.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MATHIAS: I thought the latter...I thought that....I couldn't believe that it was
                    his considered, deliberate policy and that I suspected what was happening that
                    bits and pieces of his policy were being woven into this pattern by some of the
                    apparatus. I still think that's largely what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does half-smack of underlings taking control, thinking
                        they knew what their great leader wanted or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: That's right and the President may or may not have been informed in a
                    timely way of what was happening. That's still not clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1988?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling at that time about whether America
                        and the world? Did you see us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: Well, I, of course, was not prepared for the complete collapse of the
                    Soviet Union which took place almost immediately thereafter. I think at that
                    moment we had a somewhat optimistic view that things were slowly improving, but
                    we didn't realize there would be this total change almost overnight. As I look
                    back on it, it was a surprise that the Berlin Wall came down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the foreign relations process
                        within the Senate vis-a-vis the White House and all? Did you feel that it
                        was a healthy one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: I'm not sure that there was the direct flow of communication between
                    President Reagan and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that
                    there had been between the Committee or the Senate generally and earlier
                    presidents. It seems to me that the President was protected by staff to a
                    greater degree than earlier presidents had been. One of the things that was
                    lacking in that period was the free communication between the President and the
                    Senate which has been an element of foreign policy at many of the more important
                    moments in our history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Senator, I know we're pressed for time so why don't
                        we stop at this point, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATHIAS: All right.</p>
