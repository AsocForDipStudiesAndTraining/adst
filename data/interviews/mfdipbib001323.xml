                <p>COLE BLASIER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Peter Moffat</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 28, 2002</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cole Blasier is an outstanding academic who started his
                        career in the Foreign Service. Can you tell us how, and when and why you
                        joined the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: My interest in U.S. foreign relations and in the Foreign Service began
                    when I was a Supply Officer in the Pacific during World War II. I served on PT
                    Boat Bases 21 (New Guinea) which launched attacks on the Philippines and PT Boat
                    Base 17 in Samar, P.I. which prepared for the invasion of Japan. My Navy memoirs
                    are contained in a book published by PT Boats, Incorporated Memphis,
                    Tennessee.</p>
                <p>During that time I read everything I could lay my hands on about U.S. foreign
                    relations, and particularly relations with the Soviet Union. This reading
                    stimulated my interest in the Foreign Service. In order to establish a firmer
                    career base, I decided to work for a doctorate in international relations with a
                    Russian emphasis. I interviewed Merle Fainsod at Harvard University and
                    Professor Philip E. Mosely of Columbia. Mosely impressed me greatly and I
                    decided to go there for graduate work.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in the fall of 1946, while I was finishing undergraduate work at the
                    University of Illinois, I read an announcement about Rotary International
                    Fellowships. At the same time I had become interested in news from Chile that
                    the Communist Party had won its biggest electoral victory in the Americas and
                    was participating in the President's cabinet. I applied and was awarded a Rotary
                    Fellowship for Chile.</p>
                <p>On the grounds that Eastern Europe was enough to master so early, Mosely advised
                    me not to go to Chile; to come immediately to Columbia so I could work on
                    central issues related to Germany and Russia. But I went to Chile anyway and
                    spent a year in Santiago researching the Communist Party through pamphlets,
                    newspapers, and interviews. When I came back to Columbia, that study helped me
                    meet graduate degree requirements and I wrote an article for the Political
                    Science Quarterly entitled “Chile: A Communist Battleground.”</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, some of my fellow students were going off to the Foreign Service, and
                    I applied as well. I passed the written, but Joseph Green deferred my candidacy
                    on the grounds that I did not know enough about American history. He was right,
                    and I spent every spare moment during the next year reading up on American
                    history, and passed the second oral examination. I continued graduate study in
                    international relations and Soviet studies at Columbia, completing residency
                    requirements and the oral examination for the Ph.D. in international relations
                    and law. Now all that was required for the doctorate was the Ph.D. dissertation.
                    However, I broke off work on the dissertation and entered the foreign service in
                    October 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it was very difficult to get into the Foreign
                        Service, in the early McCarthy period, or-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, to a point. Though not necessarily because of McCarthy. There
                    appeared to be a ceiling on recruitment of FSO 6s, that is at the bottom.
                    Instead, the Department was hiring experienced officers from civil service and
                    other lists. More young people wanted to come in and few FSO 6 slots were
                    authorized.</p>
                <p>My problems related to McCarthyism occurred not in getting into the foreign
                    service but with respect to promotion during my second post in Bonn. In 1954-55
                    the State Department personnel office attempted to block a list of about a dozen
                    officers from FSO-6 to FSO-5. No reason was given to me at the time but later I
                    was told that Interpol was after me for having crossed from Chile into Argentina
                    illegally. I eventually found my passport which showed an Argentine stamp for
                    the border crossing. This was a threatening situation since we were all on
                    probation. My unsubstantiated explanation is that somebody in State thought my
                    interests in the Chilean Communists and the Russian language were suspicious.
                    Late in 1955 that list of officers, me among them, was promoted on a separate
                    recommendation to the congress. I was promoted two more times before my
                    resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we may be getting ahead of ourselves. When you
                        entered the Foreign Service, your first post was Belgrade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. In preparation for Belgrade I was assigned to the Foreign Service
                    Institute and Serbo-Croatian language training. My knowledge of Russian helped
                    with Serbian.</p>
                <p>At that time, January 1952, Yugoslavia was one of the most strategically
                    important countries in Europe and in the middle of the Soviet-American
                    confrontation in the Cold War. Tito openly challenged Stalin's leadership of the
                    international Communist movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, once allies, were involved intermittently in
                    sporadic armed skirmishes along Yugoslavia's eastern borders. Stalin had lost a
                    hoped for a window on western Europe and the Adriatic and faced an upstart
                    political model threatening his control of communist countries in Eastern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Tito had to defend his borders and, potentially, the whole country from Soviet
                    Bloc hostility, even attack. In 1952 he had not yet firmed up relations with the
                    United States and other Great Powers and had territorial and political rivalries
                    with his neighbors, Italy and Greece.</p>
                <p>Our main job in Belgrade was strategic, to keep Yugoslavia and Tito from
                    returning to the Soviet bloc. There was vocal opposition to this policy in the
                    United States by minorities, partly on the grounds that Tito had a bloody record
                    in consolidating his power, and that he was and remained a staunch communist.
                    One of our jobs in thEmbassy was to monitor Tito's foreign relations with
                    respect to negotiations with foreign governments and their domestic
                    repercussions.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador and senior members of the Embassy did the monitoring, but
                    negotiations tended to be conducted through Washington or by special envoys. I
                    followed them quite closely, and my assignment was to report Yugoslav reactions,
                    especially as shown in the local press or through contacts with foreign
                    embassies. My most interesting work, however, was to report on Yugoslav domestic
                    politics.</p>
                <p>In order to refurbish his credentials as a Communist, symbolize his repudiation
                    of Stalinism, and strengthen his hold on the country long term, Tito reorganized
                    the nation's political and economic structure as a new form of Communism. We
                    followed this with great, if some times skeptical, interest. The specifics
                    included assigning the Communist Party with a mainly “educational” role (it was
                    mostly window dressing), the decollectivization of agriculture (a form of
                    partial privatization), and the establishment of workers' councils (workers
                    “management” of industry) - all an anathema to Stalinism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were assigned in what capacity in Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: First, I was assigned as a visa officer in the consulate. After six
                    months in the consulate I joined the political section in June 1951, and
                    remained there for two years, the latter including a six months extension.</p>
                <p>Q: And your ambassador was George Allen?</p>
                <p>BLASIER: George Allen, that's correct, and much later James Riddleberger.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Jake Beam as Allen's deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in the consulate, you must have polished
                        your Serbo-Croatian in visa work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. With the help of my previous academic preparation in Russian and
                    Serbian and two months experience with help from the consular staff in visa
                    interviews, I was able to interview independently in Serbo-Croatian. I also
                    hired a tutor and got up every morning before 6:00 A.M. for a two hour lesson.
                    My wife joined me at first and then took up French. Actually she learned to
                    speak Serbian quite well on her own, and dealt with our maids and tradesmen in
                    Serbian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, can you situate this for us? It must have been at
                        least two years after Tito's break with the Soviets and about the time of
                        Tito's break with his most charismatic lieutenant, Milovan Djilas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. Belgrade still showed a lot of war damage in the winter of 1951-52.
                    It was dark, unpainted, gloomy city, bullet ridden downtown, and very short on
                    housing for everybody, including all the diplomats that were there. And, there
                    was some mutual suspicion between the Yugoslavs and the western diplomats. My
                    wife and I lived in the Excelsior Hotel for six months in a single room. We had
                    a private bath and took our meals in the dining room. And then Peg Glassford,
                    the future wife of Jake Beam, was reassigned and we moved into her house where
                    we were very happily settled for the rest of our tour.</p>
                <p>By this time a lot of the U.S. domestic political opposition to our collaboration
                    with Tito had passed. The turning point in our relations with Tito and changes
                    in Yugoslavia occurred during our assignment. Our warming relationship with Tito
                    was fueled by economic and military assistance, as well as the political shift
                    in the Yugoslav leadership and the construction of the new “Yugoslav
                    communism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the opposition to U.S. policy about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Some of the opposition had been defeated by Tito in a civil war. They
                    had their own axes to grind. They used Tito's communism as a reason why we
                    shouldn't support him. It was a pattern which we have also seen with respect to
                    immigrants from other countries, where they hope to shape U.S. policy towards a
                    surviving dictator. That happened with Cuba and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you defend U.S. collaboration with Tito?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: By the time of our arrival in Belgrade, Congress was appropriating funds
                    to support Tito and collaboration with the Tito regime was beginning. Our policy
                    was defended as an important way to contain Stalin. Many of us accepted that
                    because even though Tito was a Communist and a ruthless dictator, he represented
                    the best opportunity we had to split the international communist movement.
                    Yugoslavia blocked the southwestern expansion of the Soviet bloc and Soviet
                    access to the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>Tito was more accessible to westerners than Stalin, less paranoid, able to
                    delegate, and more flexible. Yugoslavs were less fearful and suppressed than the
                    Soviet peoples, even after Stalin's death. The Soviet and Yugoslav communists
                    were not the same breed of cat. Yet we had to live with the fact that Tito
                    exploited his people, consistently overriding opposition and living like a king
                    in a poverty stricken country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No doubt your graduate studies of Communist countries and
                        your face to face experience with Yugoslavs in the consulate caused the post
                        management to co-opt you into political work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, my work on Communists in Chile, Cuba, and Eastern Europe. Also I
                    had studied Yugoslav issues with Professor Mosely at Columbia, a leading
                    specialist on the USSR and Yugoslavia who participated in the wartime
                    negotiations over Europe and Trieste. My experience helped me get the
                    opportunity to work with Ambassador George Allen. It was his talents as an
                    ambassador and as a person, that drew me to him - not his knowledge of
                    communism. He was a colorful, warm, broad-minded person, an excellent diplomat
                    who didn't fit the usually misinformed stereotypes.</p>
                <p>And his deputy, Jake Beam, was a perceptive observer and a genial colleague. He
                    gave his whole life to the service and was rewarded by many ambassadorships.
                    Much later Henry Kissinger humiliated him by a high level visit tMoscow without
                    informinAmbassador Beam in advance of his visit. Beam found out through the
                    Russians. In his memoirs Kissinger expressed regret and said that he never
                    visited Moscow again without having our ambassador participate in the
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>My knowledge of Serbian, useful within about six months of our arrival, was
                    important for the political section and elsewhere. At one point, the station
                    chief relied on me to make or take lengthy telephone calls with one of his
                    sources, and on which my immediate superior, Turner Cameron, frowned. I was
                    approached no more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to take you up on your offer to describe George
                        Allen and his modus operandi...</hi>
                </p>

                <p>BLASIER: Allen was a jaunty guy. He appeared on one fourth of July in a white
                    suit, as Tito did on some occasions. In the winter he wore a rakish hamburg,
                    with a broad curled brim. He liked to dance. His wife Kitty, was a great asset
                    to him, especially kind to young people.</p>
                <p>Unlike some contemporary ambassadors, Allen looked on the foreign service as a
                    band of brothers where the older members bring the younger along to ensure the
                    continuity and quality of the service. I think he may have been consciously
                    training us younger officers. He occasionally invited some with their wives,
                    like Peter and Pam Walker, to the residence for afternoon badminton. My wife and
                    I were frequently invited to lunches with visitors from abroad. One was Josef
                    Korbel, Madeleine Albright's father and former Czech ambassador to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Allen taught me some valuable lessons by doing, not by lecturing. Not
                    long after I was moved to the political section, I was under the supervision of
                    Turner Cameron, a conscientious foreign service officer, much schooled in
                    protocol by Ambassador Jefferson Caffery in Paris. Not long before Christmas I
                    got a note from Allen asking me to draft a Christmas message to the Embassy
                    staff. Conscientious to a fault and under Cameron's influence, I sent a draft to
                    Allen which might have passed muster by Amy Vanderbilt. That ended my exchange
                    with Allen on that subject. He wrote his own warm, Christmas message, seemingly
                    addressed to each one of us. This was a stern reminder to get my priorities
                    straight.</p>
                <p>When I was assistant to Allen at the summer capital in Bled, I was responsible
                    for getting our “pouch” to the Embassy in Belgrade in the Embassy plane - we had
                    no other secure communications. Instead of instructing the plane not to take off
                    until I arrived, I got to the landing strip before its scheduled departure but
                    just as its wheels were rising off the tarmac. A dumb gaff on my part, and I was
                    humiliated. Allen did not make one word of criticism. Don't worry, he said, I'll
                    get it there another way. Throwing caution to the winds, he asked his trusted
                    friend and my acquaintance, Meyer Handler of the New York Times, to take it on
                    the latter's return trip to Belgrade. After that I would have done anything for
                    Allen.</p>
                <p>When I was Allen's aide in Split for the visit of the Seventh Fleet under Admiral
                    McCain (the Senator's father), McCain's staff officer informed Allen that there
                    were only 12 places for Americans at the shipboard dinner, and there were 13
                    names on our list. Lt. Del Landry USN, the assistant naval attach�, and I were
                    lowest on the list. Allen called Del and me aside and said that in cases like
                    this he favored the officer in the service involved, in this case the Navy. That
                    meant Del. This seemed reasonable to me, and I learned not only something about
                    protocol, but graceful solutions to touchy questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Allen did virtually all of his work in English. He had used some French in the
                    past and always spoke to his butler in elementary French. Previously, as a
                    language junky, I had been critical of the foreign language skills of so many of
                    our ambassadors. Then it dawned on me that many of our best ambassadors haven't
                    spoken foreign languages fluently, Allen among them. This is not a reason to
                    deemphasize foreign language training, but only to judge ambassadors on the
                    whole range of their skills.</p>
                <p>Allen spent many Washington assignments during the war, which paved the way for
                    his first ambassadorship in Iran in 1946. Most of his posts since 1933 were, of
                    course, in Democratic administrations. After Eisenhower and the Republicans won
                    the 1952 election, he went to Washington to “consult.”</p>
                <p>Shortly after his arrival he got a call from the White House: “Is this George
                    Allen?” He said yes. “The president would like to see you.” When he walked into
                    the President's office, Eisenhower said, oh, there must be some mistake. I
                    wanted to see another George Allen. [that probably was George Allen known as the
                    court jester of presidents.] This provided an amusing introduction and the two
                    had a good talk. Not long after Ambassador Allen's return to Belgrade, his
                    appointment as Ambassador to India was announced.</p>
                <p>My wife and I were also privileged to make the acquaintance of Jacob Beam,
                    Allen's deputy who became charg�. Not yet married and alone at the post, Beam
                    occasionally dropped by for a drink. On one occasion he broke the news to us
                    that he would represent the United States in Moscow after George Kennan had been
                    declared persona non grata. Another time he told us that he had been appointed
                    to represent the United States at Stalin's funeral.</p>
                <p>Jake was always interesting to talk with, especially when he told about his
                    service in Berlin in the Nazi period under Ambassador Dodd. He described how he
                    was able to prove mass deaths of Jews by visiting cemeteries and counting up
                    inscribed headstones. He was a quiet, shy unassuming person, a keen observer and
                    a steely analyst.</p>
                <p>Jake was one of the most unselfish and loyal officers I have known and one would
                    never have thought of him in terms of a party affiliation. When Foster Dulles,
                    the new Secretary of State, sent us his infamous message demanding positive
                    loyalty, Beam was cut to the quick. He said he had joined the service under
                    Secretary Henry Stimson, a Republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the ethnic antipathies that presumably always existed
                        in Yugoslavia, visible during your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, of course we were aware of them. Yet, the people of Sarajevo, one
                    of the most mixed populations, seemed to be living together peacefully. One of
                    our best Yugoslav friends were a couple in Belgrade - he a Serb, she a Croat.
                    They were always joking about this aspect of their relationship, but
                    occasionally one would note an edge. My view has always been that these
                    neighbors can live together peacefully provided the government is tolerant and
                    magnanimous; otherwise, there can be big trouble. Trouble makers like Slobodan
                    Milosevic must be denied the opportunity of capitalizing politically on ethnic
                    divisions by promoting divisive and bloody conflicts. Tito followed the opposite
                    policy, one of reconciliation, also for political reasons - to maintain his
                    authoritarian controls. His policy was symbolized by the oft repeated slogan:
                    “bratsvo i edinstvo” (brotherhood and unity).</p>
                <p>Tito held the country together ultimately by brute force. Yet he preferred to use
                    it as a last resort. He was more flexible and gave his lieutenants and the
                    population more slack than Stalin. Tito was more self-confident than Stalin and
                    lacked Stalin's paranoia. Tito tried to hold the country together by solving
                    ethnic problems, if not that way then, by force; Milosevic inflamed them. Tito
                    showed that with a viable political structure imposed on these people, they
                    could get along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that time Tito's lieutenants were Kardelj, and
                        Rankovich, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: And Djilas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Djilas. But Djilas was already beginning to show some
                        signs of independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. The publication of Djilas' heretical views in the magazine Nova
                    Misao led to his expulsion from the Central Committee and the loss of his
                    political and other positions. He believed that Yugoslav communism had spawned a
                    new class, the country's leadership, which enjoyed much of the power, wealth,
                    and privileges of the old capitalist class.</p>
                <p>Djilas lived near us on Voje Vuchkovicha Ulitsa and I saw him several times on
                    his evening walks. I remember once I came up behind him and greeted him in
                    Serbian: “Good evening, sir, how are you?” He was very frightened.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Before his fall I went to a Communist Party youth congress, and was seated with
                    Dick Harmstone, another officer from the embassy, in the front row of the
                    balcony of a large auditorium. Everybody was waiting for Tito to come in.
                    “Tito-Tito” they were chanting; it went on for nearly an hour. I clapped
                    politely at the beginning and then stopped clapping. Harmstone stopped clapping.
                    For the next forty minutes there were only two people in that huge room who
                    weren't clapping. We were on the front row of the balcony where everybody could
                    see us. I wanted them to see us; that we weren't clapping. At last Djilas came,
                    substituting for Tito. He spoke with real panache. He was a favorite with the
                    youth and they liked him. He made some sense. His biggest trouble came after I
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: I left in June of 1954. I was there when Stalin died, but before
                    Khrushchev arrived. I heard many stories about Khrushchev's drunken performance
                    outside the Majestic Hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I understand there was a United States food program
                        of some sort that had been set up and a military mission. Am I correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, there were several missions. There was a large foreign economic
                    assistance mission, a military assistance mission, and the United States
                    Information Agency. There were also agricultural attach�s, military attach�s,
                    and CIA representatives. We could only guess who the latter were - except for
                    the Chief of Station. There were contradictions in the relations between the
                    military aid mission and the military attach�s. The military aid mission sought
                    to build up the Yugoslav armed forces, and the attach�s to collect information,
                    some secretly, on the same forces. The military aid mission disliked informing
                    on their Yugoslav colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the work in the political section beyond
                        reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: If I may, first a word about reporting. After I left the consulate and
                    joined the political section, my duties were mainly reporting. I began by
                    writing the WEEKA, a telegram sent every week to Washington summarizing the
                    major political events. I also wrote short telegrams every few days on
                    particular subjects. My main interest was writing fairly long analytical reports
                    on major political and political-economic developments. Some of those topics
                    included decollectivization, workers' councils, the Serbian church, the Djilas
                    controversy, developments in the leadership, the Trieste Crisis, Macedonia, the
                    Balkan Pact, Soviet relations, etc. Who knows whether these strenuous efforts
                    were read by anybody besides the desk officer, Ollie Marcy, but he did write me
                    a strong commendation.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>My relationship with my immediate supervisors, the chief of the political
                    section, first Turner Cameron and his successor, Edwin Kretzmann, was crucial to
                    this effort. Both gave me my freedom to interview and write.</p>
                <p>The relationship with Kretzmann was especially sensitive. He entered the service
                    as an FSO-3 and rose to FSO-1 in Washington. He reported to the deputy Chief of
                    Mission, WoodrufWallner, an old European hand, only just promoted to FSO-1.
                    Kretzmann, then 58 years old, had limited foreign experience. He did not know
                    Eastern Europe or its languages. He was a facile writer but always working with
                    unfamiliar subjects. His situation was professionally difficult. He was always
                    generous and helpful to me and we became good friends.</p>
                <p>My reporting responsibilities were not just a “desk” job. At one time or other I
                    visited all six constituent republics. My wife and I entertained frequently and
                    went to a round of cocktail parties. At those parties I would check with
                    colleagues from various embassies about the major issues of the day and these
                    conversations were often reported in telegrams or dispatches. Ambassadors
                    occasionally invited us to dinner where a junior American was required; we were
                    friends with many of their staff, the British, French, and Germans especially.
                    With permission, we exchanged dispatches with the British. Duncan Wilson, the
                    British Deputy, later wrote a major book on Yugoslavia. As mentioned earlier, I
                    also acted as an aid to the Ambassador on various occasions, including at the
                    summer capital in Bled and during the visit of the Seventh Fleet to Split.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador was constantly on the prowl, especially in high Communist circles,
                    and almost every morning he came in to send short cables on the previous days'
                    findings. His telegrams were often a page or less. Something new, something
                    important that he'd got from the top leaders or something they were feeding
                    him.</p>
                <p>George Allen was an ideal diplomat: knowledgeable, down to earth, sophisticated,
                    and wise. Once he told me we shouldn't care whether Yugoslav communism succeeds
                    or fails - we just have to deal with it. Academic or ideological issues didn't
                    really interest him much, but he was glad to have our political reports, which I
                    suspect he skimmed faithfully, to keep current.</p>
                <p>My wife, child, and I lived off our salary which started at $4,600 a year. Our
                    entertaining probably cost more than we could afford, but we did it anyway,
                    keeping detailed records, and submitted them with a prayer. We followed that
                    practice later in Bonn. In both Embassies we were reimbursed to the penny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A part from political contacts, what else was important in
                        our relations with the Yugoslavs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BLASIER: Our economic aid program was probably the most important. That was one
                    way Washington hoped to tie Tito to the West and to us. The chief of the aid
                    mission ran these programs and I suspect that decisions about the level and
                    direction of aid to Yugoslavia was made in Washington with help from the aid
                    mission in Belgrade. The chief of the Economic Aid mission appeared to conceive
                    of himself as a special envoy to Belgrade, reporting mainly to Washington with
                    independence and prestige of his own. The head of the military aid mission may
                    have had similar but less pronounced conceptions of his role.</p>
                <p>As far as I know, Allen got along with these missions somehow, supporting them
                    sometimes, and checking them on others. Naturally the foreign service officers
                    were under his direct purview (less those assigned to the aid mission). I
                    noticed that he carefully cultivated the military attach� and the Press attach�,
                    the latter acting as his press advisor and press representative.</p>
                <p>Allen did not “command” all these disparate elements, but was in a permanent
                    state of civilized negotiation. I think he considered this his job and in so far
                    as personalities were concerned he could master most situations - maybe not all.
                    Allen “ruled” by his presence, his public image and manner, his good humor, his
                    humanity, and his ability to seize the initiative when decisive action was
                    called for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an observer of what was going on in Yugoslavia, what
                        trends and developments did you discern at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Tito was trying to build his own system which would have a validity and
                    a viability of its own, and not simply be a poor copy of the Soviet system. He
                    wanted this both for his own ego and because of his heritage as an ex-Soviet
                    style Communist. He wanted Yugoslavia to have significance in the history of
                    Communist movements. I doubt that he ever intended to give up his ruthless

                <p>Tito claimed to be starting Yugoslavia off on a new kind of socialism which could
                    be more humane, more democratic, more economically viable, etc. I first learned
                    of a big step in that process when George Allen returned from a reception where
                    he learned, perhaps from Moshe Pijade, that the Yugoslavs were giving up Soviet
                    style agriculture (the kolkhozes)-</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, this was really big news for us, for the USSR and for international
                    communism. To this day, Putin has not yet been able to come to grips with the
                    organization of Russian agriculture. The Yugoslavs also experimented with labor
                    unions, workers' self management, and the workers' councils, much of which
                    worked out more in theory than in practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well wouldn't an answer be a vital element of this desire
                        by Tito to institutionalize his changes; wouldn't it be to prepare a
                        successor to himself for when he died?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, he did come up with some legislation and complicated organizational
                    maneuvers, but it could only be temporizing. Facing a choice, Tito was prepared
                    to risk Yugoslavia' future, but not his hold on power to the moment of his
                    death. His elaborate arrangements to ease an eventual transition were mainly
                    window dressing. But these arrangements lasted longer after his death than I
                    expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't the Soviets, through their proxies, sort of
                        nibbling at the Yugoslav borders; sort of incidents from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, I kept totaling those incidents up, especially along the Rumanian
                    and Bulgarian borders. Tito responded tit for tat on these encounters. If he
                    hadn't done so, there might have been significant military encounters. After
                    Khrushchev visited Belgrade these problems stopped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: This was big news for everybody, especially the Yugoslavs. They were
                    glad not to have to deal with Stalin any more, but they were uneasy about what
                    might come later.</p>

                        Can you describe a little bit how Yugoslavia figured into these
                        changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. Tito wanted to be sure that Moscow would be deterred from a Soviet
                    attack to restore Yugoslavia to the Communist bloc. I don't think Tito was
                    expecting one immediately, but he could not be sure. Defense of Yugoslavia from
                    Soviet attack was a long term objective. The members oNATO weren't going to let
                    him into NATO. Yet strategic objectives could be met by the Balkan Pact, a
                    mutual Defense Treaty between Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. Since Turkey and
                    Greece were both in NATO, membership in the Balkan Pact provided unspecified
                    security for Yugoslavia. Tito had boundary disputes with his neighbors on both
                    the west and south, Italy and Greece.</p>
                <p>I followed closely Yugoslav press coverage of both. The most important was the
                    crisis with Italy over Trieste. The American Embassy in Rome backed the Italians
                    on the Trieste issue with heartfelt support from Ambassador Claire Booth Luce,
                    whose influence with Washington was considerable. Our tactic was to smother
                    Washington with full reports on the Yugoslav actions and points of view while
                    minimizing direct confrontation with Mrs. Luce.</p>
                <p>At one point there was risk of a war between Italy and Yugoslavia. Both countries
                    mobilized, their were mass Italian and Yugoslav demonstrations. Mobs gathered
                    menacingly around the American reading rooms, insults were exchanged and our
                    press attach� got punched in his already large nose, which covered nearly a full
                    page in Life magazine. As a young and relatively hefty member of the Embassy
                    staff, I was called on to help “defend” the reading rooms. I did not advise my
                    wife in advance of this assignment and put on an old gabardine suit, should
                    tomatoes or other debris be hurled. The senior USIA officers and I marched
                    heroically up and down in front of the menacing mobs, certainly some of whom
                    considered this play acting. During these tense days several members of the
                    Embassy staff approached me confidentially, to find out whether they should send
                    their families out of the country.</p>
                <p>The dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia was settled by negotiations in October
                    1954 after my departure from Belgrade. Italy got the city of Trieste and
                    Yugoslavia got a good deal of surrounding territory.</p>
                <p>Yugoslav relations with Greece were also intermittently stormy over the boundary
                    with Macedonia, press coverage of which I also followed. In this connection I
                    paid a visit to the capital of Macedonia, Skopje.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall you had not yet finished your Ph. D
                        dissertation. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. As my tour in Belgrade was coming to a close, I was forced to fish
                    or cut bait on the doctorate. I had already completed all requirements except
                    the presentation and defense of the dissertation. Most of the research and
                    writing was completed. My only chance was to complete a presentation copy in
                    Belgrade so it could be sent to Columbia University in time for a defense that
                    summer during home leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I took two weeks leave in Belgrade, hired a full time secretary, and got a copy
                    in the mail to the committee well before leaving Yugoslavia in June. My
                    professors came to New York from their August vacations for the occasion and
                    approved my defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1954, you moved to Bonn, after home leave. How did you
                        happen to be assigned to Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: When in Belgrade I filled out my next post preferences: Moscow, Bonn,
                    and a third I've forgotten. Moscow was out apparently because there were a queue
                    of officers, some of whom had already completed Soviet training at Department
                    expense and had priority. My orders came through to Salzburg, then headed by
                    Tully Torbert, who forty years later turned out to be a good friend and
                    neighbor. I understood why I was turned down for Moscow but was disappointed not
                    to get Bonn. Somebody must have intervened, possibly Woodie Wallner who was
                    always supportive. My orders were changed to Bonn. That was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the duties assigned to you in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: My orders were to Bonn with no job in the Embassy specified. I called on
                    a personnel officer for my new assignment. She said that the Embassy had
                    arranged for me to work as an assistant to Herve LaRue, the consul general.
                    After a five second pause, I asked her: “Is there anything else?” She said she'd
                    look into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't inclined to serve under LaRue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Herve LaRue was notorious in the service as a leader who sponsored
                    prayer meetings in his office. I've forgotten what they prayed for, but I
                    associated him, perhaps mistakenly, with Scott McLeod and other McCarthy
                    types.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did they find for you instead of Herve LaRue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BLASIER: They said they could assign me to the economic section headed by John W.
                    Tuthill, the minister counselor who coordinated all economic functions. Tuthill
                    asked me whether I might be interested in taking charge of the comprehensive
                    economic reporting program (CERP) for Germany. That involved comprehensive
                    quarterly (and annual) reviews, of the West German economy, editing
                    contributions to the reports from various Embassy sections, and coordinating the
                    economic reporting of the consulates and Berlin. I could write about almost
                    anything on the German economy, but did not have operating responsibility. I was
                    assigned to the commercial section with little or no direct supervision. We had
                    a staff of experienced Germans who assembled statistical publications on Germany
                    and supported their neophyte supervisor.</p>
                <p>Tuthill probably had trouble filling this job. An “all but the Ph.D. dissertation
                    candidate” himself, he concluded rashly, that I might do in the absence of
                    anybody better. Actually, I was really not qualified for that job but by
                    vigorous application I made do by at the end of a year. I was proud of my work
                    and got my third promotion, this time to FSO 4.</p>
                <p>A week or two after my arrival in Bonn and after I had escaped Herve LaRue, Woody
                    Walner, one of my mentors, paid us a visit from Belgrade. We called on his old
                    friend, Elim O'Shaughnessy, the chief of the Embassy's political section. Woody
                    asked me if I would like to meet O'Shaughnessy. We went to his house and had a
                    drink. When I walked in the door, Elim reached for the stud book (the Biographic
                    Directory) and read my entry while talking to us. We stayed for a while and the
                    next day, I got an invitation to join the political section.</p>
                <p>My heart leaped; my dream had always been to establish myself in political work.
                    It had been my academic training, my major experience so far, and my field work
                    in Latin America and Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, I had committed myself to
                    Tuthill, he had saved me from Herve LaRue and I couldn't walk out on him. Also I
                    was convinced that I would be a better political officer later with more
                    economics under my belt. And this particular job was in some many ways more
                    challenging, if less comfortable, than political work on East Germany, Berlin,
                    etc. I declined with regret. When Tuthill left for Paris eighteen months later,
                    I transferred to the political section.</p>

                        particular areas did you feel you had the most role in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Well, Bonn was probably one of our biggest embassies. My work was
                    demanding and intense, and it involved working relationships with many other
                    economic and political officers. Also I dealt with all the consulates and
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>My central task was to ride heard on the German economic miracle, its
                    relationship with various industrial, labor, trade, agricultural and other
                    sectors. The economy was purring along at a 6% annual growth rate year after
                    year, and everybody wanted to know whether this remarkable growth would be
                    sustained. We were expected to make some predictions, and usually did so after
                    rounding up forecasts in the press and leading economic journals. At first the
                    German staff read many sources for me. After the first year my German was good
                    enough to read them myself. Although dependent on the German staff initially in
                    writing the survey reports, I was able in less than year to write them largely
                    alone. I also wrote dispatches on a few key current issues, like economic
                    aspects of German reunification and rearmament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the people you worked with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Although respected and well liked, Ambassador Conant was a remote and
                    little known to most Embassy staffers, including myself. Much of what I knew
                    about Conant was through his special assistant, Allen Siebens. Tainted by his
                    conscientious service in China, Siebens was a victim of the McCarthy period. His
                    promotions had been held up years because of his association with the old China
                    hands. Conant was protecting him. Some time after I left Siebens' promotion was
                    effected and he resigned from the service the same day. He worked later, I
                    believe, first with Carter Burgess and later Frank Pace.</p>
                <p>James Conant spent much of his time traveling around the country by train making
                    speeches in German to German groups. My guess is he thought that this could be
                    his best contribution, and he liked the contact.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Speculation was occasionally offered that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
                    was his own Ambassador to Germany. However many good traits he may have had -
                    President Eisenhower admired him, Dulles was a self-centered, ill-mannered, and
                    clumsy secretary. Some of the functions often performed by ambassadors at other
                    posts, like maintaining morale and being an example, were performed in Germany
                    by the Deputy Chief of Mission, Walter Dowling, supported by his conscientious
                    wife, Alice.</p>
                <p>Our Embassy in Germany had to deal not only with Foster Dulles but also with
                    Eleanor Lansing Dulles. If you took off their glasses and cut her hair, these
                    siblings could have been twins. From Washington she devoted herself to Berlin -
                    was called the mutti or mother of Berlin. Nothing was too good for Berlin -
                    don't spare the costs. She could get a lot of what she wanted brandishing the
                    names of “John Foster,” and at times, her deceased uncle and former secretary of
                    state Robert Lansing.</p>
                <p>While devoted to the rebirth of Berlin and of Germany in a United Europe, Tuthill
                    was cost conscious, as demonstrated later in his Topsy campaign against
                    overstaffing embassies. He felt we had done much for Berlin and the revolving
                    fund (built by the repayment of former loans) would continue Berlin's healthy
                    growth. To promote this approach he asked me to write a pamphlet showing how
                    much we had done, and also reassure the Germans about our continuing commitment
                    to Berlin. In what was a partial answer to Eleanor, I wrote an illustrated
                    pamphlet on German American cooperation in Berlin, which was translated,
                    published, and distributed throughout Germany East and West.</p>
                <p>The Bonn Embassy was a great opportunity to meet foreign service officers of
                    promise who would later play useful roles in American foreign policy. Many had
                    good careers in other parts of the world thereafter. Walter Dowling, Jack

                        after Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes I did, at Detachment R near Garmisch, Germany. This was a Defense
                    Department school which admitted a few civilian students, in that year, John
                    Baker and myself.</p>
                <p>The faculty was composed entirely of Russian speakers from the Russian and other
                    Republics like the Ukraine. Many were bitterly anti-Soviet and profoundly
                    prejudiced in their lectures about Soviet reality. It was not that they were
                    always wrong - one can understand why they were so anti-Soviet - but that they
                    spent too much of their time proving their anti-Soviet credentials rather than
                    giving a many sided view of Soviet reality. There was one educated, thoughtful
                    and creative analyst who was able to leave behind his cruel treatment as a
                    former Communist and member of Agitprop during the Great Purges. Kunta was his
                    pseudonym, A. Avtorkhanov, his real Chechen name.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Detachment R was a great place to learn Russian - the language of lectures, of
                    class discussion, and examinations. Oberammergau also was a great place to
                    charge one's batteries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you finished in Germany in 1957, you were ready to go
                        back to the delights of serving in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes. That's right. I had been abroad six years on three fine
                    assignments. The department must and should rotate people back to Washington.
                    Even though my dream of an assignment to Moscow had still not been fulfilled, I
                    really understood completely and had no complaint about going back to the
                    Department. My wife and I bought a house in Cleveland Park and loved
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>My assignment to the Soviet internal section of the Bureau oIntelligence and
                    Research (INR), and my previous assignments in Belgrade, Bonn and Oberammergau
                    qualified me for the queue for a posting to Moscow.</p>
                <p>All my assignments came at a time of big moments in world history. In Belgrade
                    Tito's break with Stalin reshaped world communism and the balance in the Cold
                    War. We came to Bonn when Adenauer was rebuilding Germany after the defeat of
                    Hitler, the German economy was a miracle, and German rearmament a major issue.
                    We came to Washington just as Khrushchev was tearing down the Stalin myth,
                    trying to strengthen the Soviet economy and society and open ties with the rest
                    of the world. Washington was an excellent place to gain perspective on these
                    developments, all of which I wrote about.</p>
                <p>At the same time my work in INR was confining with little contact with people
                    outside our division - the main job was to review and comment on Soviet
                    newspapers and intelligence materials. I respected and liked my colleagues: Ken
                    Kerst, Sol Polansky, Heyward Isham, Bob Davis, Jack Matlock, and many
                    others.</p>
                <p>My experience and that of my friends reinforced the view that I had long held
                    regarding the Foreign Service, that the title literally means “service,” that
                    the interests of the service precede those of its individual members. I knew and
                    accepted as fact that if I remained in the Foreign Service, I would never be
                    able to control fully where I worked, what I did, and when I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you divide up the duties among the people you
                        mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BLASIER: As I recall, maybe incorrectly, Polansky and Isham did top leadership,
                    Davis had certain related matters. I did education, science, nationalities,
                    Central Asia, and special assignments. I think Matlock dealt with cultural
                    issues. He may have roamed rather widely over other subjects, too, as many of us
                    did. I, for example, wrote an intellectual history of Khrushchev in preparation
                    for his visit to the United States.</p>
                <p>I was a member of the team that received Khrushchev during his visit to
                    Washington in 1959. As mentioned below, I had already been in Russia and knew
                    the Minister of Higher Education. I accompanied the latter on his appointments
                    and was present at major functions.</p>
                <p>All Russian subjects were interesting for me. But, analyzing the Soviet press in
                    Central Asia was stultifying, repetitive, and usually unrewarding. We also had
                    reports from U.S. government agencies who interviewed American visitors
                    returning from the USSR. With some exceptions, those visitors knew so little of
                    Soviet life and Soviet science and education that it was hard to squeeze much
                    out of their testimony. We had access to most of the official cables going back
                    and forth, including highly classified ones. That was fascinating!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned that you'd been to Moscow. What
                        connection was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: In 1958 the “thaw” was beginning to melt Soviet relations with the rest
                    of the world. More westerners were coming to visit the USSR and had better
                    access in many places. The secret police still tried to monitor and control
                    their citizens' contacts with the populace, but conversations were possible.
                    Many American delegations were scheduled to visit the USSR that summer. The
                    Embassy had its usual business plus riding herd on these delegations,
                    politically important U.S. officials, and influential Americans. This was an
                    important moment when access for political reporting was better than ever,
                    though still not good. The Embassy asked Washington for help in handling the
                    heavy anticipated traffic. Having had extensive academic training and a tour at
                    the Oberammergau Russian Studies School, I was a logical candidate for temporary
                    duty at the Embassy. I lived in Moscow for about three months in the Metropole
                    Hotel. This was the realization of a dream of my life. Young people today who
                    have long had access to Russia may not be able to understand how much it meant
                    to aspiring Russian specialists to set foot on Soviet soil.</p>
                <p>Since the end of the Second World War I had fervently wanted to visit the Soviet
                    Union. During these months I visited Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Kharkov.
                    Delegations that I escorted took me to Tiflis, Alma Aty, Tashkent, Bokhara, and
                    elsewhere. In Tashkent I met the Grand High Mufti. My interviews included
                    ordinary people, students, university rectors, faculty, tradesmen,
                    architects.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Many of my contacts took place in parks, on the trains or buses. In a park, for
                    example, a Russian would come up to talk and we would end up having a
                    conversation so intimate that you wouldn't have it with an American until you'd
                    known him for five or ten years. Because they so wanted so badly to speak to
                    somebody from outside, they had so much to get off their chest that and they
                    spoke openly, very openly. You knew that when you had finished that
                    conversation, you would never see that person again. I was almost sure that
                    after such meetings, the police would interview them and order them never to see
                    me again. I doubt that they ordinarily would have been arrested on just one
                    encounter. These talks were extremely rewarding for me and gave me insight into
                    the Soviet Union that I had never had before.</p>
                <p>During that summer I served as an escort and occasional interpreter for three
                    delegations: 1) the first delegation of University presidents to visit the USSR,
                    headed by Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield of the University of Pittsburgh, 2) a
                    delegation of American social scientists, including Frank Snowden, Dean of the
                    College at Howard University, and 3) a delegation of U.S. veterinarians. All the
                    rest of the time I was on my own to pursue visits and conversations with Soviet
                    officials and citizens and to write a flurry of reports back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your reward was in a sense this INR stint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Maybe, but that was secondary. The Embassy needed help in this it's so
                    far busiest summer. INR had the money and manpower and I was selected to go.
                    Yes, I was grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's high praise for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Well, whatever, I was grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were the main things you worked on, education and
                        other aspects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Education reform, which was one of Khrushchev's big things. I also
                    looked after the Academy of Sciences. Higher education was another big subject;
                    in addition to secondary education. My duty was also to read the five republics'
                    newspapers from Central Asia, an incredibly boring and repetitive task. More
                    interesting were the personalities I was asked to follow.</p>
                <p>It was about this time that I began to reevaluate my past and future prospects in
                    the foreign service. At the age of 33 it was time for me to decide whether to
                    remain in or resign from the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But before you leave, looking back, were you particularly
                        prescient or particularly blind to certain trends? With the benefit of hind
                        sight, did you see the end of the Soviet regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: No I didn't, but I always bore in mind Kennan's belief in the late 1940s
                    that the USSR would probably collapse from within. I knew that the Soviet system
                    was grossly inefficient, that the Communists were totally unable to harness the
                    creative talents and the energies of their people, and it was politically an
                    ugly system known as such to many of its people. Knowing the faults of the
                    Communist system is one thing, predicting its collapse is another. That takes
                    political magic. Note that the USSR collapsed thirty years after I left the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Soviet Union collapsed so rapidly, some sharply
                        criticized our intelligence for not foreseeing the collapse. This is of
                        course a generation after yours, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: I'm not sure that all the people who made those criticisms were really
                    entitled to make them. After all, as mentioned earlier, George Kennan predicted
                    such a collapse in the late 1940s. My view is that the main function of
                    analytical intelligence is description and explanation - not prediction.
                    Financial advisors often tell clients to be suspicious of salesmen who claim
                    that stocks will move in certain directions. Investors, they say, should stir
                    clear of such soothsayers.</p>
                <p>The same might apply to intelligence. Our intelligence's main fault was not
                    failing to predict Soviet collapse but instead overstating the strength of the
                    Soviet armed forces and the Soviet economy. Sometimes exaggerations were often
                    more the fault of politicians, who had axes to grind, than our intelligence
                    people. The latter usually erred on the side of hedging their bets - on one hand
                    this, on the other that. My view is that the problem was not that intelligence
                    failed to predict the unknowable future; it was that some government leaders
                    exploited intelligence, whether consciously or not, to support their
                    self-serving interests.</p>
                <p>Appraisals of intelligence need to distinguish between:(1) collection (overt and
                    covert), (2) analysis, (3) policy making, and (4) political action. The CIA, for
                    example, is not supposed to, and often avoids taking responsibility for policy,
                    and if so, should not be criticized for policy errors. Whatever the shortcoming
                    of collection and analysis may be, I fear they are less at fault than errors in
                    political action: Cuba, Nicaragua, Chile, Iran. CIA's covert assets have some
                    times been exploited to promote misconceived foreign policies and private
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your time did political considerations intrude on
                        policy? You had the A Team, B Team, problems in CIA, or on policy towards
                        the Soviet Union? Was there any of that in your time? Were there efforts to
                        make them appear worse than they are, better than they are or any outside
                        intrusions like that that you are aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BLASIER: That's a huge question. Answering off hand for my years working on
                    European affairs, I don't believe there were any policy errors under Truman and
                    Eisenhower that compare with the disasters we faced under Johnson, Nixon, and
                    George W. Bush. In general, there was unanimity on fundamentals in Soviet policy
                    within the administration and in the public at large. By the early 1950s the far
                    left had been largely discredited and the center tended to support the
                    Eisenhower administration on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Secretary John Foster Dulles appeared to have feared greater disunity in the
                    state department than in fact existed, especially within the foreign service.
                    One of his first acts was to send to posts abroad his demand for positive
                    loyalty from the Foreign Service. Jacob Beam, charg� in Belgrade, was deeply
                    offended. He explained to us that he had entered the service when Henry L.
                    Stimson, a Republican, was Secretary of State. Beam later demonstrated his
                    loyalty to presidents from both parties, including Richard Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't experience mistakes in policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, but there must be more than I could mention now without researching
                    the subject. We probably spent more money on Tito than we should have. Our
                    policies towards Berlin worked. Claire Booth Luce, our Ambassador to Italy, was
                    in love with Italy, and couldn't see U.S. crucial interests in Yugoslavia
                    relating to the Cold War. There were tactical errors, like supporting the
                    Hungarian revolution and then not following through when the Soviets invaded.
                    Eisenhower's efforts at peace making collapsed when he bungled relations with
                    Khrushchev over the Soviet shoot down of Francis Gary Powers. There may be many
                    other examples, but this is too big a subject for this oral history. In any
                    event, a personal answer to your question is that I did not resign because of
                    policy differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that this was the beginning of your disaffection
                        from the Foreign Service or your inclination to go back to the academic
                        world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: No, it was not disaffection from the Foreign Service, nor, as I've said,
                    grave criticism of our policies in Europe. But my experience there did get me to
                    thinking about where I had been and where I was likely to go. One conclusion was
                    that I had had excellent assignments and the odds for duplicating such
                    assignments of such quality in the near future were not good.</p>
                <p>I realized my ambition to go to Moscow and had a good look at Russia from inside.
                    Being cooped up in Moscow or in some other authoritarian eastern European
                    climate, like Warsaw or Budapest, now seemed less attractive. And, of course, it
                    took nearly thirty years from that time before Eastern Europe opened up.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The main thing was the FSO's total dependence on the Foreign Service for where
                    one works, for whom one works, what one does, and when. I didn't want my whole
                    future to be determined by a sometimes necessarily faceless foreign service
                    bureaucracy. I thought if I got a job outside and liked it, I could stay and
                    wouldn't move until something better came along. That's the way it happened.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, fine, for a few years, say four to six. Not for a full career, as
                    required of a professional. Perhaps, I'm not laid back enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had one final temporary duty as a Foreign Service
                        Officer in Moscow in 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, while assigned to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    (INR).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this standard practice or was this unusual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Not unusual, nor frequent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was to avail the Department a particular skill on your
                        part or was it to reward you? What was the motivation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Somebody might have wanted to reward me but I doubt it. No reflection on
                    me but things usually don't work that way. The Embassy had a pressing temporary
                    need and Washington found me and the money to fill it.</p>
                <p>Moscow was busier that summer than at any time in recent memory. Moscow embassy
                    was being flooded by delegations from the U.S. and the Embassy wanted to take
                    advantage of new political reporting opportunities created by the “thaw.” I
                    served as escort and occasional interpreter for three large delegations and took
                    on a few other odd jobs. I spent most of the rest of my time writing political
                    dispatches on a wide variety of subjects based on trips in Western Russia and
                    Central Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of delegations was this, congressional

                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BLASIER: The three main delegations were: the first for U.S. University
                    Presidents to visit the USSR, a delegation of social scientists, and a
                    delegation of veterinarians. I helped other visitors. My work led me to
                    fascinating political, economic, and cultural topics beyond the scope of this
                    oral history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that when Llewellyn Thompson was American Ambassador
                        to the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: It was. I could add a word about him if you want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please, please. What can you tell us about Thompson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Tommy Thompson was already an icon. I had followed his negotiations on
                    the Austrian State Treaty from Belgrade. The Ambassador was thin and did not
                    appear strong physically. I had the impression he was under great stress, had
                    medical problems, and was caught between boorish leaders in Moscow and
                    Washington. He had to internalize so much of the frictions and controversies
                    that it was a very heavy burden for him to carry. Much of the management of the
                    Embassy was in the hands of his deputy, RicharDavis, who I had met at Columbia.
                    Thompson came into the Embassy to handle the most pressing business and then
                    would leave. I didn't see much of him initially.</p>
                <p>My first opportunity came at a smallish reception at Spaso house. During the
                    course of the reception, he invited me sit down for a talk. I have met and
                    talked with many famous people in my life, who almost without exception want to
                    do all the talking. Instead, he wanted to learn about what I'd observed there,
                    and had read my dispatches. His interest was not a compliment to me, but more to
                    him. Few celebrities ask anything about you; they want to tell you about them.
                    He made an indelible impression.</p>
                <p>On another occasion I learned about Thompson's interview with the Soviet foreign
                    minister - maybe it was Molotov. Discussing some controversial issue the latter
                    went into a rage against the U.S. that went on for about ten minutes and then he
                    stopped. And then Thompson just sat there in silence for maybe five minutes.
                    Didn't say a word, not a word - just sat there. Silent.</p>
                <p>Molotov didn't know what to do, became flustered. At last he said what about
                    this? Thompson replied: “Are you finished?” The Ambassador gave him this silent
                    rebuke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your reporting or analyzing time there, what were your
                        particular monuments? Did you do studies of education, studies of the
                        internal processing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BLASIER: Most of these dispatches are probably in the diplomatic archives nearby
                    in Maryland which I hope to consult some day. Among the subjects I now dimly
                    remember dealt with anti-Semitism, maintenance of public buildings, an interview
                    with the Grand High Mufti of Central Asia, my treatment by the secret police
                    including entrapment efforts and poisoning, descriptive pieces on living
                    conditions, and visits to Central Asia. In order to answer this question
                    properly, I would need to go through these dispatches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had an advantage later in your academic career of
                        going back to Moscow in different periods, which gave you a chance to notice
                        changes from one period to another. What struck you doing this? Was change
                        as slow as you thought it would be, or faster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Many of the underlying aspects of Soviet public opinion and politics
                    were pretty similar from the time of my first visit in 1958. During Khrushchev
                    and the thaw, the USSR was much more open and rational and under Brezhnev
                    authoritarian and bureaucratic themes became stronger again. With Gorbachev
                    trends were in the opposite direction. About all I can say now is that many of
                    the leading themes during Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Gorbachev and Putin were similar
                    but their weight and arrangement varied substantially.</p>
                <p>The first time I returned to Moscow after leaving the service was in 1978. I
                    arranged that second visit while on an inter-university travel grant in Warsaw.
                    On that visit I laid the ground work for the U.S.-USSR exchange in Latin
                    American studies. IREX covered the U.S. costs of the delegations of U.S.
                    scholars and the USSR Academy sciences through its Institute of Latin America
                    for theirs during the years 1985 to 1990. As chairman, I went to Moscow one or
                    more times a year for the exchange, and on others for research on my book, The
                    Giant's Rival, the USSR and Latin America. Until 1980 continuities in political
                    attitudes and political organization were greater than the changes. After
                    Gorbachev had been in office attitudes towards the regime and towards the U.S.
                    changed rapidly. What has been wonderfully consistent since the last years of
                    Gorbachev to the present is the free climate for personal and political
                    discussion with Russian friends and colleagues. To answer this question properly
                    requires more space and time than we have here.</p>
                <p>The Exchange ended in late 1990. Since that time I have been to Russia every few
                    years on various missions. For example, one was serving as a consultant for the
                    International Executive Service Corps at the State University in Vladivostok.
                    And in 2000 I was an observer for Putin's election as president for the OSCE in
                    Kazan, Tatarstan. I continue to research Russian subjects, especially topics
                    related to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958 when you were on temporary assignment to the
                        Embassy in Moscow were you already more or less determined to go back to the
                        great outside world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BLASIER: My conversations with Chancellor Litchfield and other university
                    presidents in 1958 started me thinking. That was probably the most difficult
                    time in my life, a decision-making process that was having adverse impacts on my
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You discussed this with your chiefs in the INR or did you
                        weigh some offers before you decided to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: No, I didn't. In the end I only had one offer. I looked around at
                    various places. None of the opportunities appealed to me, nor I to them. In the
                    end, I had only one offer that was acceptable and I took it. It was from Everett
                    Case, the President of Colgate University, a former Harvard business school
                    assistant dean, and assistant to the founder of General Electric, Owen D. Young.
                    He was one of the most respected college presidents in the country. He later
                    became president of the foundation of his father-in-law's competitor, Alfred P.
                    Sloan of General Motors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I meant offers within the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: No, I assumed that I would be in INR for some months more and then get
                    another assignment. It seemed too soon to seek another assignment, and besides
                    one assignment was not the issue. Meanwhile, Grover Penberthy, my personnel
                    officer and by chance a personal friend, urged me not to resign and to take
                    extended leave instead. This was good advice and I was touched by his and maybe
                    the Department's concern. Convinced, however, that I had to make a firm
                    decision, I declined and resigned in September 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Department was the big loser in this, but you went on
                        to a very distinguished career in the academic world, particularly in the
                        field of Latin American studies and relating them to the Soviet Union in
                        part.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLASIER: Yes, thank you.</p>
